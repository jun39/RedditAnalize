And I guess if you're using a darknet market, then yeah you're trusting shady people with your money, which is... well, that's pretty stupid, and largely unnecessary. But not really much different than giving cash to a stranger.

whitslack,"&gt;if you're a merchant accepting funds from customers and your shop loses power taking your LN node offline any merchant can attempt to steal from you by transmitting an older LN channel state. you need to hire watchtowers to help prevent this.

Again, this is only true if your node is offline for longer than your `to_self_delay`, which you can set up to two weeks. You only need watchtowers if your node might be offline for longer than your `to_self_delay`. A merchant is never going to be offline for that long.

&gt;1 day, 2 weeks is still distincitly worse than waiting 10 minutes for 1 confirmation on Bitcoin.

That clearly depends on your operational priorities. Waiting 10 minutes (or occasionally over an hour) for a confirmation is quite often unacceptable in a retail point-of-sale environment. The merchant can risk accepting an on-chain transaction without any confirmations, but that is absolutely less secure than accepting a Lightning payment.

&gt; Saying both the have the same exact level of security is just plain deceitful.

I didn't say that.",fcogl01,2020-01-01 07:35:21,1

Leading_Zeros,"Most people believe being able to assay the coin supply is far more important than having strong privacy on the base layer. If there was an inflation bug in Monero or Zcash we may not find out for years, or ever, as there is no way to see the transaction amounts you cannot count all the coins. Can you feel confident using a system like that? 

Bitcoin is pseudonymous so does not give absolute privacy by default. But if you are careful with coin control and not link your transaction history to your real ID, then it is possible to preserve your privacy. Just takes more effort and use things like coin mixing, avoiding KYC exchanges and using Lightning Network for everyday transactions. More privacy preserving tools are coming in the future. Also simply having far more users increases your anonymity set. If only a few thousand people are running a privacy coin's protocol, maybe their internet traffic is worth surveilling by intelligence agencies.",fcom1v7,2020-01-01 08:40:28,1

ace_rimjob,"&gt;The blocks mined on Bitcoin are larger than BCH.

60% Veriblock but keep jacking off like that isn't a thing

&gt;Bitcoin HashRate is much greater than BCH.

There are other ways to mitigate double-spends than raw hashrate, which is grossly overbuilt and inefficient on BTC for how little throughput it has. Many BCH developers are working on TX finality and node synchronicity unlike BTC that gave up any meaningful development or added security *years* ago

&gt;Bitcoin price in USD is 33x that of BCH.

Already circling back to speculative price mattering, it does not except for tiny minded morons like yourself who can't see the bigger picture. Bitcoin wasn't built just to bag hold until you can sell it for more, that is just a distributed pyramid scheme

&gt;Bitcoin has a much greater value sent in US Dollar terms, daily.
&gt;Bitcoin average transaction value is higher than BCH.
&gt;Bitcoin has greater number of transactions actually made per second, than BCH.

Again a lot of it is Veriblock, proving that raw TX counts are also not a good metric of success.

Otherwise value moved is subjective based on market action. Of that value, BTC has the unique ability to destroy that value with high fees. BCH is far less lossy if you are doing a lot of business.

You are welcome to source your numbers otherwise for this claim. 

&gt;Bitcoin has many more active addresses than BCH.

This is the most irrelevant metric you've cited thus far

juliushenkin,"Bitcoin Cash is definitely executing its goal of bringing censorship resistant money to the world, and it is growing every day. It is being used for payments more than BTC in certain regions and websites. It actually works, regardless of the market cap or the number of people using the network. As long as the adoption numbers keep going up, Bitcoin Cash will eventually eclipse all other currencies on Earth.

The best way to increase adoption is to make it easier and more convenient for people to use it. This means improving user experience in wallets and online. Implementing solutions like BIP70 is a good example of this. People should never have to copy and paste addresses and amounts when paying for things online and in person. Many people are not skilled enough with technology to figure out how to navigate complex menu systems in wallets. [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com) has a great wallet for the average person.

stoichammer,"Brilliant! 

This post highlights the significance of UTXO model to scaling like no other. The author provides elegant supporting mathematical proofs (albeit the randomized set caveat) which have profound implications.

Merkle trees as a testament to Bitcoin's potential to boundless scaling is only HALF the story, the other (arguably more significant) half is the UTXO model itself. 

I had similar intuition behind my distributed architecture paper, where I coined the term [Zero-conf Transaction Inputs (ZTXI)](https://gist.github.com/stoichammer/3bb383f3b4634b2196742ddac5ed6cd1), as the fundamental unit for achieving massively parallel Tx validation/Mempool acceptance/Sharding. Although I fell short of applying academic rigour to furnish proofs like u/-mr-word- has done. 

While my approach was more practical with an engineering bent, to see some mathematical bounds being derived along with a functional (recursive) algorithm is a great thing. I believe u/-mr-word- independently invented the same/similar concept under the name **RTXI**.

baconcheeseburgarian,"In that scenario, you're even more compelled to flee that system.  The appeal of bitcoin and crypto is it is non-correlated to the world market.  If it preserves value better against a crashing local currency or world economy, people have more incentive to switch.

The DeFi space in Ethereum is really interesting.  It's providing a way to exist between both crypto and fiat, providing you tools to borrow against assets or program how you want to hedge and leverage your wealth based on the current market.

A lot of people do flee their local markets to USD.  I'm not disputing that.  I am pointing out that a lot of people chose to put their wealth in bitcoin and the usage grew exponentially after events where their local economy crashed.  Stats show the majority of investors are storing and accumulating wealth in bitcoin as opposed to spending it.  They arent fleeing the asset.  They are buying and holding.

In a real, worldwide slowdown, people are going to put their money wherever they feel its safest and not under threat by the rest of the market.  That might be gold, it might be art, it might be diamonds and it might be bitcoin.

Kain_niaK,"BTC has OMNI and counterparty.

Counterparty was actively sabotaged when the devs changed op_return from 80 to 40 bytes. Yet counterparty became a success.

OMNI only has one token that is actively being used: Tether.

OMNI has it's own nodes. when Tether was hacked, the Tether guys simply asked all the OMNI nodes to upgrade to software that undid the hack. 


So OMNI is pretty centralised. Which is why Tether is now on ECR20 and other token systems.

1. No chargebacks, ever
2. No credit card/ bank fees
3. Never deal with banks again
4. Never touch disgusting filthy paper money
5. Never go to an ATM again
6. Pay for LEGAL weed and guns at stores that have been deemed too ""high risk"" for credit card services (basically all the dispensaries where I live in Boulder, CO do NOT accept credit cards for this reason)
7. Merchants never pay credit card fees, which are 1-3%+
8. Donate to people who have been banned from all other payment processors (ex: Laura Loomer)
9. Drug dealers can avoid being spied on by Paypal or Venmo
10. **Send money across borders and currencies for free (this is huge, remittances will change forever)**

Applications like [OpenBazaar](https://openbazaar.org/) are far superior to Ebay, with ZERO fees and chargebacks.

Why do reputable exchanges require many more confirmations for BCH, than Bitcoin?

I have sent both BCH and Bitcoin to an exchange at the same time, with sending just a few seconds apart. 

I always send BCH first as it requires a lot of confirmations. 

Bitcoin always clears first, and BCH has always taken longer for me. 

As an example, let us take Coinbase. Coinbase requires 3 confirmations for Bitcoin, and 12 for BCH.

iiJokerzace,"Tell them that NANO is potentially *more* secure than bitcoin due to its unique design of PoS. 

Bitcoin uses full nodes to keep the network decentralized with anyone able to run one. However there is a weakness called a Sybil Attack.

When you look at the full nodes connected, there are no sure-fire way to make sure those nodes are unique and not actually one entity pretending to be thousands. This leaves some uncertainty for BTC's security. There is also the fault of full nodes becoming more demanding and expensive to run, less people will be able to run and participate. This is important because the less amount of full nodes, the bigger the chance of a Sybil attack. 

NANO on the other hand has representatives (Also full-nodes) that only validate if the users allow them to. User's in a sense ""stake"" their currency to a rep of their choosing. Since the currency has the power to validate the network, we now have a real and anti-counterfeit number of validators (the static supply) and are controlled by the people who own the money themselves. As a large holder of the coin, it is your incentive to make sure you pick a good representative or risk your own money's value and functions.

Even if nodes start to get low and number and get more demanding, we can still keep them decentralized by distributing validation across what super nodes are still running. 

-

Another thing is that Bitcoin is CONSTANTLY inflating and will continue to inflate until 2140. I say that's too big of a reward for miners since they also make money from FEES of people making transactions. 

NANO though is already completely printed (static) and distributed out and will only continue to distribute without any deflation or inflation. It's perfect for a currency since its already static instead of bitcoin that will be constantly inflating for over a century, it should stabilize much faster and be easier to use going off an already static supply.",fcs76us,2020-01-02 05:59:57,4

One could argue that Travala means 1 single merchant accepting Bitcoin Cash but I think it is reasonable to say over 600,000 hotels accept Bitcoin Cash today (since you can pay with BCH).

panduh9228,"Would just like to remind everyone of a few simple truths\* that may calm you down some:

* You're most likely here because at one point you learned about how bitcoin works, and concluded it has a real utility and place in today and tomorrow's world.
* These boom and bust cycles are simply market noise overlaid on top of the adoption curve.
* The aforementioned cycles cannot complete themselves until backwards-looking analysis utterly fails. That is to say, those who look at previous bear markets as a confidence-crutch for an incoming recovery (and this is the majority of people) will give up hope once the bear market hits all-time-high levels of despair. That ""measurement"" is vague, but it is a combination of how far down the price goes and for how long the bear market lasts. At this point, most traders' spirit is broken from so many failed rallies and we enter uncharted waters. And there will be no more charts to point to and say ""Look it's been here before and recovered, so it can recover again."" All that's left to hold on to is the understanding that the blockchain technology is extremely reliable, and the belief that individuals of the future will desire to store some wealth in this decentralized, autonomous manner. Only then will the market have the backbone to expand steadily again (and most likely accelerate upwards into another bubble because markets are driven by humans, and humans repeat these emotional cycles over and over).
* The rally to 14k ultimately failed not because the whole experiment is over, but because the current cycle hasn't completed yet. It was too soon. People were (and likely still are) too hopeful for a swift recovery - and with that hope comes fear. Once the hope dissipates, the fear dissipates as well as what remains are the market participants (holders) who are genuinely comfortable with the possibility of the price going to $0. And that, my friends, is the starting foundation from which true price growth again becomes possible.

*\*While these ""truths"" are only my opinions, they're my most fundamental understanding of these markets.*",fcv5yvs,2020-01-03 05:02:18,30

CoolFoundation4,"&gt;Ss: Oops I meant Jewish Jessie Smollett

Most people don't know this, but Jessie Smollett IS Jewish (half Jewish to be exact). 

So the Jewish Jessie Smollett is... Jessie Smollett.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jussie_Smollett#Early_life

Promoting the idea that there's a huge anti-semitism problem is one of the major ploys that the Jewish Supremacists use to engender public sympathy and thereby wield political influence.

The problem is that there's so little **real** anti-semitism that they have to manufacture it with fake hate crime hoaxes.

A few years ago, there was a wave of hate crime hoaxes against Jewish centers.

Over 1,000 anti-Jewish threat phone calls were made. Bomb threats and other types of threats.

[JCC Threat-Makers: 2 Years, 1,000 Calls](http://newobserveronline.com/jew-jcc-threat-makers-2-years-1000-calls/)

Turns out that 2 Israeli Jews were paid in bitcoin to create this wave of hate crime hoaxes.

[JCC Threat-Makers “Paid with Bitcoin”](http://newobserveronline.com/jew-jcc-threat-makers-paid-bitcoin/)

No law enforcement has determined who paid them. But who benefited?

A very likely suspect is the ADL (Anti-Defamation League).

This wave of over 1,000 hate crime hoaxes was used by the ADL to raise huge amounts of money.

The ADL also used it as a pretext to pressure Amazon to ban a bunch of books on Holocaust Revisionism.

source:

https://codoh.com/library/document/5330/?lang=en

When the Israeli Jews were caught, the ADL blamed the bomb threats on ""white hate"" rather than a Jewish hate crime hoax.

[ADL: Israeli Jew’s Bomb Threats against American Jews are “White Hate”](http://newobserveronline.com/adl-counts-jews-162-bomb-threats-against-jews-as-white-hate-crime/)

So that's the current world. There's so little **real** anti-Jewish hatred that the Jewish Supremacists have to manufacture it with fake ""anti-semetic"" hate crime hoaxes.

But what about the reverse? What's the state of Jewish hatred against whites?

Here's an American rabbi preaching that God has given Jews a mission to ""fix the world""? 

But what happens to people who don't want their country to be ""fixed"" by Jews? Exterminate! Every man, woman, child, and even the babies must be genocided.

This rabbi specifically states that the countries that must be genocided are American and most of europe (white majority countries)

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/dtx7zi/exterminate_an_american_rabbi_says_god_had_given/f6z9jbl?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x

And.... [When Zion has the Power...all Christians will be killed because they are idolator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJRZkqYkJOM)

Of course, these Jewish Supremacists pay no penalty for promoting genocide of white majority countries. Why not?

You aren't allowed to discuss or protest when Jewish Supremacists express genocidal hatred of white gentiles (non-Jews).

It's one of the many signs that we live under a SJS (System of Jewish Supremacy)

But most people don't know this, because the concept of [""White Supremacy"" is used as camouflage to cover up the fact that we actually live in a System of Jewish Supremacy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/d4al5e/why_do_universities_push_the_myth_that_black/f0alnsj/?context=3)

If the rest of the market pumps, Ethereum is unlikely to be left behind, and as positive news starts affecting price again, Ethereum has more real development news than any other chain, period.

From the article:

&gt; This new format would allow the following things:
&gt; 
&gt; - On-chain games. Rules of the game are enforced by the smart contract.
&gt; 
&gt; - Native tokens, i.e. token rules are enforced by a smart contract, similar to ERC-20 tokens.
&gt; 
&gt; - Decentralized exchanges (DEX).
&gt; 
&gt; - Advanced wallets, much more capable than what is possible now (recurrent payments, auto-shuffling, last-will clause, etc. all in one wallet, ran automatically, non-interactively).
&gt; 
&gt; - Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which make decisions autonomously. MakerDAO, a decentralized stablecoin that ensures the price of a token stays at $1 using smart contracts would be a complex example, but there are simpler ones.
&gt; 
&gt; - Zero-knowledge proofs like zkSNARKs or zkSTARKs. These are incredible pieces of technology that allow fully private transactions and efficient verification of complex contracts.

Mike Hearn and Gavin wanted to prevent Bitcoin from being hijacked, so they created a fork. That fork didn't survived after they were heavily DDOS.

And of course, now that Mike Hearn is gone, the character assassination campaigns are directed at Bitcoin Cash main supporters like Roger Ver.

ace_rimjob,"Yeah, figured as much even looking at that troll infested shitpost on /cryptocurrency that had close to 1400+ upvotes, the most I ever see there organically is like 500 max, usually on Nano shilling or other *Non*-cryptocurrency garbage like XRP and IOTA.

Of course anti-BCH hatefests get a boost from what is undoubtabley some Blockstream spook.

Even if the data was bad that Hayden posted, bitcoinbch.com isn't the sum total of Bitcoin Cash any more than Roger Ver is. This was clearly vote manipulated by cheating douchebags regardless to create artificial drama because that is all they have left to save the failing BTC narrative since LN is ridiculed shit (even on /cryptocurrency oddly enough) and BTC itself is not popular either. It can be argued that neither is BCH, but that is a result of this kind of manipulation, gaslighting, and disinformation far more than fundamentally on the tech or community. I bet the discrepancy of Travelbybit data would have come and gone in a few hours if not for this latest manipulation campaign, some asshole decided to make a mountain of a molehill 

Good job fucktards, keep wasting your money on votes and stalking Twitter like the fucking losers you are, after 2.5 years none of it has helped BTC scale, get adopted, or make BCH go away (which has survived and *thrived* against all odds).

SolomonGrundle,"The authority nodes carry out a mandatory update (technically a fork) after the vote and that is all. There is no fork as you might be thinking (as in, splitting of the chain as with some other protocols), that is the beauty of the VeChainThor blockchain, all updates are unilaterally enacted and everything proceeds as before with all block producers and stakeholders on the same path. No one needs to be concerned at all, nothing will change for anyone.

Also, the addresses weren’t removed, simply blocked from ever adding data to the blockchain again (due to authority nodes not processing data from these addresses). They still exist and always will, just in limbo.

Here is the definition of a fork from Wikipedia to avoid any more confusion:

“Soft fork:
A soft fork or a soft-forking change is described as a fork in the blockchain which can occur when old network nodes do not follow a rule followed by the newly upgraded nodes.”

Which all ANs do, regarding that final point. It’s a seamless transition to a new rule for the whole protocol. That’s the benefit of having an environment where the block producing nodes can easily reach consensus and upgrade in sync. VeChain avoids any contentious hard forks or chain splitting like has previously occurred with Bitcoin and Ethereum as a result. It’s a much more efficient and business friendly means of governance. The community voted, the vote is enacted in its totality and that is that.",fcz0xlc,2020-01-04 07:44:20,23

[https://twitter.com/ToneVays/status/1213886570320797698](https://twitter.com/ToneVays/status/1213886570320797698)

&gt;There is almost 0 innovation difference between 1917 Model T &amp; Modern Day Tesla. In my view we still drive the Model T today (it just has things like seat belts &amp; gps added) Why is it so hard for [@officialmcafee](https://twitter.com/officialmcafee) &amp; many others to see [\#Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hashtag_click) adding additional features?

First of all, LOL at the suggestion that there has been no innovation between the Model T and Tesla. The truth is harsh, and I believe between the years of 2020 and 2022, the entire market will come to see it:

[https://twitter.com/iamDCinvestor/status/1213887618892611584](https://twitter.com/iamDCinvestor/status/1213887618892611584)

&gt;Because the Bitcoin protocol lacks the basic level of programmability / expressivity to add most of the functionality people are excited about.  And it can't be introduced without what most consider to be an impossible hard fork.

There are still quite a few Bitcoiners who are content to just have their digital gold, recognizing it can't do much more than that. I respect those folks more than the ones (like Tone Vays) who are holding out false hope that Bitcoin can somehow meaningfully evolve out of its current state. It will see incremental upgrades and optimization, but it very likely will *never* hard fork to add the functionality to add anything remotely similar to DeFi on Ethereum. Such apps will be relegated to L2, and so far, people don't want to seem to use those- nevermind the fact that most require you to exchange Bitcoin's trust-minimization / censorship-resistance for some federated side chain run by 20 to 30 actors.

I know, I know- I've been saying it for well over a year now, but I still believe that in a market with information asymmetry like this, ETH is tremendously underpriced relative to other chains. I have worked diligently over the past 2 years to build out my own position before that asymmetry is ultimately eliminated.

BTC may start the next cycle with its liquidity advantage, but I believe ETH will later outperform it with its innovation advantage. And at this point, we're not just talking about protocol innovation, but quite meaningfully, we are also talking about composed app innovation.",fdaw5w3,2020-01-06 04:03:59,37

ThrowBackFF,"&gt; Anarchy just means no heirarchy. You can still have a government and  rules without heirarchy. A pure democracy (direct voting on all issues)  would be anarchist, for example. 

To expand on this for those interested:

&gt;""If liberalism, communism, and fascism differ over how powerful the state should be, anarchism rejects the notion of the state altogether. Anarchist share with communists the belief that private property leads to inequality, but they are opposed to the ideas that the state can solve this problem. As the Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin (1814-76) once stated, ""I am not a communist, because communism unites all the forces of society in the state and becomes absorbed in it... While I see the complete elimination of the principles of authority and governmental guardianship, which under the pretense of making men moral and civilizing them has up to now always enslaved, oppressed, exploited, and ruined them"".  
&gt;  
&gt;Thus, like liberals, anarchist view the state as a threat to freedom and equality rather than as their champion, but they believe that both individual freedom and equality can be achieved only by eliminating the state entirely. Without a state to reinforce inequality or limit personal freedom, argue anarchists, people would be able to cooperate freely as true equals. Given that we live in a world of states, anarchism is the only one of the five primary ideologies that have never been realized. However, anarchist ideas played a role in the Russian Revolution (1917) and in the Spanish Civil War (1936-39). In North America, some versions of libertarian come close to an anarchist view in their hostility to the state, though libertarians differ from anarchists in their emphasis on private property. The digital currency bitcoin is a good example where libertarian and anarchist views overlap.

KuDeTa,"Got into crypto in 2010-2011 and remember, fondly, /r/bitcoin with under 2000 subs, and helping out on that dorky little subreddit ad. I was immediately obsessed, and though thoroughly, absolutely convinced this was an important moment in this history of money, I was too young and dumb and broke to do anything ... significant... about it. There was this strange and sexy mystery. Satoshi? Digital currency? Silk Road? Mining? I used to hang around on IRC and tried out the first OTC trading rooms. Bought a GPU and plugged into campus before I realised that could be a thing. My friends openly laughed, at first, (“Magical Internet Money”), yet soon enough they were peppering me with questions. One time I got tipped 0.5 bitcoin though the bot for no particular reason. During the rush up to &gt;$1000 I was naive, and got caught up in MtGox and by the end of the brutal winter of 2013 into 2014, found myself more or less back at square one. My friends started laughing again. At least I was working at this point and able to invest a little. But to what end? The politics in the space became awful and the emerging coup d’etat of the bitcoin project looked like it would be its certain death. I used to read the bitcoin dev mailing list and couldn’t understand the technicals enough to arrive at convincing conclusions. Then I started medical school, and decided I had better learn to code on the side. Python has been fun. In bitcoin land, at this point, there was still just a little glimmer of some hope, Gavin A and Mike H were around and coloured coins seemed promising, but all the double speak and argumentation about scaling made it quite clear we were not ready for prime time. It was also quite plain that the block size had to be increased! LN is a dead end. Lawyers in Japan continued (and continue) arguing about my small little hold. Then came ethereum. What a breath of fresh air. Vitalik and his beautiful strange funky mind. I was slightly late to the party: though not indoctrinated, somewhat confused, by the one-coiner dogma and mentality from bitcoin but, when that penny dropped .. holy fucking shit. THIS IS IT. I fondly remember being on holiday in Asia, pleading with the locals to use their internet so I could login to an exchange to buy, and then quite promptly banned because of the foreign IPs. Since then, you know what, that excitement never left me and I never felt an urge to sell a single coin. Its never really been about getting rich. It’s funny how all the old boys in cryptography argue endlessly in chat rooms about their megabytes of scale and these crazy young geniuses around Ethereum just plan and build, build build. Eventually got banned from /r/bitcoin for arguing with Null C/Greg Maxwell and his cronies (what a twat). Tried to persuade the reddit admins to seriously consider closing down that toxic little hole, but they could not give a shit about community or open source (Thank god we moved on from donuts!) Those first 9 months of 2017 were awesome, I bought into a few too many random ICOs with fervent passion (no regrets). Prediction markets! Stable coins! Cloud computing! The whole space was alive with ideas, energy and unfortunately far too many charming swindlers. My friends stopped laughing and started asking questions again. I duly advised them against the alts, though some made good profit on random hype, others doubled down on shit (TRON) and lost big time and, still would not listen. I should have known to sell when I was being invited to random WhatsApp groups to give advice to the newly converted but I was so caught up by the end of medical school I barely noticed 2017 pop. And I don’t bloody care.  At this point I feel like a wizened old man, my friends, who are now too busy and exhausted having babies to laugh, occasionally ask and then regret it when they are forced to politely listen to the ramblings of this lunatic:  I still can barely contain my excitement at scalable blockchains, smart contracts, stable coins and Web 3.0. I barely notice the price drama and come here just to occasionally exchange hopium and make sure that if I’m going crazy I’m not totally alone. I’ve spent the last two months obsessively running the beta Prysm node software on a massively overpowered mini itx build in anticipation of Phase 0, and nerding out with their devs in discord, who are awesome and energetic.

The emergency department at my local hospital is quiet tonight, so far at least, so apologies for the excessive ramble. It’s been a decade of learning , building and investing, and I guess I feel qualified to say that though nothing is certain, if blockchains are indeed here to stay then Ethereum will be a very bright part of that future. The rest is noise. Here’s to another decade and more exciting development.",fdcfust,2020-01-06 10:24:29,64

Fredex8,"The replies on Trump's tweets are fucking hilarious.

On one of them the other day two of the top ten comments were obvious scams. An 'Elon Musk bitcoin giveaway' one (which requires you to send them bitcoin to be 'entered to win') and a fake approval poll that appeared to link to a site selling Trump socks and bumper stickers using some fake pay site.

Not only do his base seem like the perfect target for such stupid scams but it's just hilarious when you think that a con-man president has con artists swarming all over this twitter page with apparently no moderation at all.

So whenever I see a painfully stupid 'yay Trump' type comment after Trump has just announced yet another awful, world destabilising decision... I find it reassuring to know that some of these morons will have been scammed out of $15 because they tried to buy a pair of socks with Donald Trump's face on them...

kusuriurikun,"For those who are....*unaware* of that particular bit of guanopsychosis:  There's been an affinity fraud running for some time now ([at least since 2015](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/15/inside-a-24-million-investment-scam-buy-the-iraqi-dinar.html) and probably in some form or another since Gulf War II) [essentially claiming that the Iraqi dinar (which is actually a hyperinflated currency that suffered a collapse due to the Gulf Wars and even during Saddam Hussein's reign was largely propped up due to currency controls, was never a freely tradeable convertible currency, and had an artificially low exchange rate) is apparently a Great Investment Whose Time Is Soon To Come](https://www.learningmarkets.com/the-iraqi-dinar-scam/); usually the claim is that the Iraqi government will effectively do a revaluation or redenomination of the currency which--with the magic of forex--will make them Rich Beyond Belief.  In truth, [investing in Iraqi dinars is about as sensible as investing in the (recently returned to circulation) Zimbabwe dollar or the Venezuelan bolivar](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertlaura/2015/03/24/retire-on-the-iraqi-dinar-and-vietnamese-dong/#19bf760a51b7) (both of which have been subject to severe hyperinflation within recent history, with Zimdollars actually approaching the Hungarian pengo's stratospheric hyperinflation before Zimbabwe killed off the Zimdollar entirely and the SA rand became the official as well as the working currency); typically these types of revaluations are functional redenominations and are a sign that a foreign currency is heading towards hyperinflation (and, well, will eventually become about as useful as a 500-trillion-dollar Zimdollar note--which ended up being sold on Ebay as curios, and resulted in duty-free shops along the South African border asking people to PLEASE not literally wipe their ass with worthless Zimbabwean currency and flush it down the toilet).

This is, of note, a scam which has particular currency (pun intended) [among MAGAts (who've also been taken in by goldbug scams, cryptocurrency trading scams, and ""Christian Gifting Club"" affinity frauds)](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-fans-sink-savings-into-iraqi-dinar-scam); this has some remarkable similarities to not only goldbug scams and Bitcoin-trading-scams, but some rather unique ""investment scams"" that are actually a unique form of affinity fraud targeting specifically New Apostolic Reformation and other ""Christian Zionist"" groups (usually involving claims of oil investment involving exploration off the coast of Israel or in or near the West Bank because ""God Blessed Israel""--alas, Israel and the Levant in general are the ONE part of the Middle East that actually is not sitting on top of a petroleum reserve--or involving farmers who are trying to raise Perfect Red Heifers so that the Third Temple can be built (no matter that [there's already a major religious shrine of the second most populous Abrahamic religion both in Israel and worldwide on the site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome_of_the_Rock) that would have to be removed first--and yes, there are NAR promoters who have actually literally proposed this, despite (or more likely, *because*) the fact that doing so would spark a religious war the likes of which have not been seen since the Middle Ages).  In fact, [at least one promoter of ""Iraqi dinar scams"" actually managed to mix both ""oil exploration"" scams AND ""Iraqi dollar investment"" scams in an apparent affinity fraud targeting the Latter-Day Saint community](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwasik/2016/08/10/dinar-scam-takes-on-new-twist/#589d660f684c) (LDS communities--due to insularity and encouragement for women in particular to be ""work at home moms"" in ""Godly businesses"", among other cultural factors--are such a consistent target of various affinity frauds that most MLMs are actually based in Utah).

And the Iraqi Dinar Grift is...apparently [a very profitable one](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndga/pr/owners-currency-exchange-business-made-600-million-convicted-fraud), for its promoters, at least; [MAGAts have been buying thousands of dollars worth of currency that is hyperinflated and sure to only get worse](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/susanwright/2018/11/you-will-not-get-rich-in-the-dinar-scam/).  This is made worse (yes, seriously) by the fact apparently there is some very MAGAt-specific nonsense going around to the effect *Trump* is apparently a Major Dinar Investor, has millions of dollars invested in Iraqi dinars (which would actually show even worse monetary sense than is typical for Trump) and that [apparently Trump himself is going to, uh, Make The Iraqi Dinar Great Again or something.](https://www.newsweek.com/some-americans-think-trump-make-rich-iraqi-money-1225643)",fdd6ujf,2020-01-06 16:56:39,95
user_48217,"I just need to say this: making a centralized digital currency is *fucking easy*. No really, you just need a database of account balances and transactions. If you want to make it more accountable you can publish the transactions and people will be able to verify that you're not changing numbers post-fact.

This has been possible for 30 years. Bitcoin did not invent any part of that. Bitcoin was a big invention because it allowed **fully** decentralized secure ledgers (thanks to proof-of-work, which solves the problem of determining consensus by tying a real-world scarce resource to the digital world), but that only matters if you're a crypto-anarchist who does not trust anyone.

So any form of ""private blockchain"" or ""national digital currency"" has the inherent question: why didn't you do this in the late 90s? Either it's a good idea and you were an idiot for 20 years, or it's a bad idea and you're an idiot now. Pick your favorite.",fddh0fn,2020-01-06 20:58:11,31

Kain_niaK,"It's the flow of money and crypto on various exchanges. You can zoom in on it. It's high res.

For example look at Bitfinex. It explains that 5% pump that BCH has seen today WITHOUT BTC going up.

Bitfinex is just Tether to Bitcoin but today there was 5 million dollar of volume that was split 50/50 between BCH and BSV without any volume between Bitcoin and real money. 

Now Tether is probably going to print so the BCH/BTC ratio can be pushed down to 0.027 again. 


Volume is at a absolute record low everywhere.  [Bitfinex volume since 2013](https://i.imgur.com/9LyGzqf.png)


[Gemini.](https://i.imgur.com/oSh7t6F.png)

Only Kraken and coinbase are doing okay. 

Because of Bitfinex and Tether a big part of the market cap of Bitcoin is fake. 
When this blows it's going to be fireworks.  And if real money on an exchange like Bitfinex is flowing in to BCH and BSV and not in BTC.

Then this means that people are accumulating BCH and BSV.

peterbowlesy,"Enjoying the debate on here. As the Dad involved my reasoning goes back to a lot of time travel movies. Often people in those have somehow bought shares in Microsoft or Apple in the early days and this funds their crackpot schemes in the future. Indeed the year I was born both Nike and Apple went on the stock market the same month (December 1980). I’ve always thought it’s a fun idea to set-up a fund for someone when they’re born. In Britain a lot of people do National Savings Bonds which are a pretty useless investment. A slightly riskier investment is better (and more fun) in my view. Bitcoin is risky, but every time I’ve called a piece of tech as transformative for the future, such as social media, the impact has gone far beyond my initial thoughts. Bitcoin is risky, but it’s still very early stage. A year ago I couldn’t place the advert using Bitcoin, this year I used a Coinbase visa debit card to do it. Using money from her own fund. Whenever there’s scarcity on the internet (domain names?) it’s interesting to see where the price can go. My hope is that when she’s 18 colleges or Unis might even accept Bitcoin for fee payments.",fddl983,2020-01-06 22:16:08,86

_Dera_,"Oh they most likely do fall for that scam.  I first started noticing those tweets on Trump's twitter feed last year and I wasn't shocked in the slightest that they always have a lot of likes and retweets.

It's also worth noting that Trump has over 60 million followers but his tweets rarely break 150k in likes.  He buys that follower number so the vast majority of his followers are bots, fake accounts, or scammers.  Last year Trump threw a fit because his follower number dropped and he accused Twitter of some nefarious deed of silencing his supporters.  What actually happened was they did a ban wave of all those aforementioned accounts and he had so many that the drop was noticeable to him.  Then like 4 days later his follower numbers shot up, and that's around the time I started seeing those bitcoin scams.

Edit to add: As to the second part of your question, I tend to think that his PR team absolutely tells him to pump the breaks on Twitter, but I highly doubt they give a shit about all the scams prevalent on his feed.  I think they realize that nothing really matters in the Trump era so his supporters getting fleeced is of little importance to them.",fddzkp2,2020-01-07 01:23:00,27

All the morons who say bitcoin is like the Tulip bubble or whatever other bubble don't understand what bitcoin is. But, the fact is that they WILL NOT be able to compare to the Tulip bubble after it breaks the previous ATH.

Name a 'bubble' that deflated and then RE-INFLATED again? Not the Tulip bubble, not the South Sea bubble, not the Mississippi bubble, or any other. If bitcoin was a simple bubble then when it went down from $19,900 to $3,200 it should have just kept going down.

It's true that those same people will call bitcoin a bunch of stupid names again--like a pyramid scam or some kind of 'Ponzi' scheme. But they can't say it's a bubble like the Tulip bubble since those bubble NEVER re-inflated again.

PS. Those idiots calling bitcoin a scam just don't understand bitcoin. Bitcoin is a new asset class in the process of being monetized. Therefore it is natural for it to go through multiple 'bubble' stages. That's OK. When bitcoin went from $2 to over $31 it was definitiley a bubble--but BTC at $31 was still undervalued. Same thing happened when it went from $1,000 to over $19,000--it was definitely a bubble but people will see in the near future that BTC at $19,000 was definitely still undervalued.",fdfxrdg,2020-01-07 13:59:14,186

I've seen it many times. People who _should_ be millionaires. Early adopters who were huge believers in bitcoin and then got cold feet at some point. One friend was an early miner, 2012-2013 time frame. Had a good number of coins. And then in mid 2015 he had a phase of being burnt out. Tired of the space and starting to doubt bitcoin's future. 

It only takes a few days of doubt to open the door to a sale that almost guarantees you'll never get to the same coin-level again. 

He sold a few hundred coins in the low $300's. Made more than 50x on his initial investment. From one perspective, that's pretty awesome. From another angle, it's probably the biggest financial mistake of his life...

VictorCobra,"Hello bitcoinmarkets! Thought I'd pop in to share my current view on the market. I apologize in advance if there's a lot of info, but what I like doing the most is observing and analyzing what's going on––trying to figure out the puzzle. I'm also procrastinating on finishing my grad school essays, and decided to write on Reddit. Feel free to gloss over most of this post if you don't care or have the time.

Anyway, the last time I posted here, I talked about LTC forming a [potential bottom](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/LTCUSD/JPg4VwKs-Comparing-Litecoin-Reversals-Why-The-Bottom-Might-Be-In/) near the $40 area, which told me that the rest of the market could also be forming a base. Since then, it has started to bounce after making a failed breakdown. My [last major long setup](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/FTual2W1-The-Last-Bullish-Setup-BTC-USD/) for Bitcoin was in advance of the 50w100w bullish MA cross. This produced a 100% move to the upside in 2016. It's taken a while to rise above both these moving averages after the cross, but it has finally happened. Since that post, I made [another analysis](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/8EEvSCr7-Bitcoin-Prints-A-Failed-Low-And-Tries-to-Form-A-Base/) showing that Bitcoin could indeed start moving up, since it also printed a failed low.

More recently, I made [a new projection](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TOTAL/3FQS22D7-A-New-Bullish-Projection-For-Cryptos-500-700B-Possible/) for the total valuation of all cryptocurrencies, showing that we can head up to the $500 Billion level or even higher. This is my target zone to make a longer term swing trade, as I think something like [this](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TOTAL/dIZQvrFT-What-Would-Happen-If-Crypto-Followed-Amazon/) could happen (comparison with Amazon stock). This may seem arbitrary, but if cryptocurrencies are going to be widely held and used, I think we may see a similar parabolic adoption curve. I don't think $10 Trillion is an unreasonable valuation for this market, *as long as people start entering again and crypto gets more positive exposure over time.*

I think we should still be careful, since the current $206-207B area was the breakdown point in November, 2018. I think we need to clear this pivotal zone, and then $230B to make room for a new market high in 2020. Otherwise, there's still the possibility of a failed rally. For all my charts, the Ultimate Oscillator (red) is showing a bullish [breakout on the weekly.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/DEaduIfe/) We haven't seen this since the April Fool's pump last year, as the UO has been cooling off since June. This could indicate that there's real bullish momentum behind this move.

Alts are finding resistance at the 100d MA, just like Bitcoin, but interestingly enough, they're ALREADY testing their [downtrend channel resistance](https://www.tradingview.com/x/NlOdYGx5/). I'm curious to see whether or not they continue to struggle there, losing on their ratios as Bitcoin moves towards its [own descending resistance](https://www.tradingview.com/x/v2FpDY7M/) (around $8600-8700)...or if they break out altogether. [Dominance](https://www.tradingview.com/x/gJ1CZZll/) is at a decision point. It can either head up towards the high 70's/low 80's, or it could break down from the rising wedge, going as low as 50% quite quickly. Past market behavior tells us that alts may have to wait until Bitcoin at leasts tests ATH levels, but you never know. Serious crypto traders will probably want to be prepared, either way.

Thanks for reading! Good luck guys :)

DCinvestor,"Don't worry, y'all. Bitcoin is not going into a full on bull market without ETH joining (and likely eventually overtaking) that party as investors seek alpha.

If you can't be patient enough to wait for that (especially if you have a personality which might draw you to FOMO at the wrong time), hold a bit of BTC so you can stop complaining. I hold 20% and sleep pretty well at night with everything else in ETH.

Remember, the lower the ratio gets, the less capital is needed to pump ETH to comparative oblivion *when it is time.* Right now, ETH is at around 1/10th of BTC (for total marketcap)...that's *a lot* of potential comparative gains possible when ETH does eventually move.

If you don't believe the thesis that ETH has the fundamentals and speculative potential needed to really outperform later in the cycle, that's fine- just sell your shit and move on.  I'll see you back here mid-cycle when everyone else starts to FOMO into ETH.

In the meantime, this market is far from a risk-on posture, and we could be many months away from big gains on the ratio...or mere days, or weeks as we continue to hug and start to peek out from under the downtrend line. I really have no idea, and that's why I'm not budging out of my ETH and have added about 30% to my position at these relative price levels in recent weeks.

I think that worked only pre-2017, if ever.   


I'd love to read streamlined thoughts about the real market situation instead of those shitty comments.   


I gladly give you my POV, but I don't claim to be accurate or right.   


A) Halving.   
The event the whole DLT world is looking forward too. Of course, it has some actual impact on the price, because the block-reward will be reduced by 50%, but the truth is that that doesn't mean we suddenly have so little Bitcoins on the markets that the prices are rising. That takes time. And the halving is \~5 months away. Anyway, I believe this thing means hype and bullish sentiment.   


B) After 2 Years of bear-market, people are craving for ROI and a solid bull.   
People want it to happen and they predict green candles, bottoms, and new liquidity streams left and right. (On Twitter and online communities at least. I consider that the effect of living in the crypto-bubble. It's impossible for me to know how people outside of our echo chamber think.) Rather bullish.   


C) Google trend-line for Bitcoin is inconclusive. ( [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=Bitcoin](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=Bitcoin) )   
Maybe it's the bottom, maybe it's a slow death. I really don't know.   


D) Geopolitical reasons... Iran etc. I am slightly bullish.   


  
E) Macro-economic reasons. People talk about a new bubble, zombie-banks, a world economy on the brink of collapsing. Some whales I talked to heard stories that family offices recommend to put 2% of their customer's money into crypto. Slightly Bullish.   


F) Scalability problems are still here. No real solution for the average joe is available. Lightning is promising but really just promising. Bearish.   


G) Bitcoin has a publicity and identity crisis. It's still seen as digital gold. No unity in the community and still too many bad players. Bearish.   


H) TA is inconclusive. TA and google trends kinda mirror each other. It's unclear where we are. And if it isn't a clear bull, I normally expect bearish moves. I'd say bearish sentiment.   


That's all I can think of right now.   


I appreciate other opinions and first and foremost why you are explicitly bullish or bearish.

Reposted for posterity's sake. Please report me.

&gt; Quick guide on signals for /u/diydude2 emotions:

&gt; (NOTE: these signals are significantly stronger when the market is trending. Lots of false signals on range bound PA!)

&gt;Happydude = generally meaningless, but a sell signal if it's in a down trend

&gt; Saddude = doesn't exist, refer to Angrydude

&gt; Bearishdude = surprisingly good sell indicator, when diydude says it is time to sell, it's actually generally not been a horrible idea in the past, although he's been off a few times

&gt; Bullishdude = same as Happydude

&gt; Angrydude = strong sell signal, do not fade this one. An increasing number of curse words and personal attacks strengthens this signal significantly. Often accompanied by attacks on people's masculinity, accusing them of being weak and feminine or even gay

&gt; Quietdude = it is time to buy, diydude has either been banned or has finally been humbled by the market

&gt; Euphoricdude = surprisingly NOT a strong sell signal. oftentimes it is a good idea to buy when the dude is euphoric and no one else is, because he is unafraid of being prematurely bullish while others are hesitant to say so. 

&gt; Postydude = the more he posts, the stronger the signal for whatever other emotion he is exhibiting. He's angry and posting a lot? Gtfo. Euphoric and posting a lot? Consider skipping out on food for a few weeks and spend it on some bitcoin.

&gt; Keep in mind that identifying whether or not we are range bound or trending is the key. Otherwise lots of these signals become totally useless! 

&gt; Significantly more advanced, complex signals will be explored later.

&gt; Theories on the existence of certain emotions are highly controversial- e.g. Does diydude become angry at the top because he knows he should sell? Or is he angry because he hasn't been able to buy the dip in a while? Scholars continue to debate endlessly.*",fdiz4m6,2020-01-08 12:33:09,35

You wont get short-term 2000% bitcoin returns, but on the other hand the chance of losing money on the long term (+10 years) is very very slim.",fdjhvr3,2020-01-08 17:18:53,33

I agree that we should make it link to the Nano Around the World video, because it shows the real world power of Nano and it doesn't ask the ad viewer to buy or do anything. The usefulness demonstrated in the video is a perfect contrast to the tongue in cheek ad imo

Curious_Exploder,"The energy required to produce a bitcoin though, (and it's not happening just in China) might be what contributes to its inherent value. Also, China seems especially well equipped now to do this, because when they were going through their massive infrastructure expansion they inevitably built some ""roads to nowhere"" or rather, they built dams that produce energy that no one is using. So instead of just allowing these facilities go unused and make the expenditure completely fruitless, some entrepreneurs are taking advantage of the power these facilities are willing to sell for cheap (because no one wants it), to recoup some of the cost of the construction of the facility.

Edit: I should specify that my comment wasn't meant to disagree just contribute to the discussion. If these companies are actually causing the price of the market on graphics cards to skyrocket, which I think is probably true, then this increased demand should be met with increased supply in the next couple of years, we might see the prices of the current generation come down much quicker than previous generations the chip companies are all rushing to meet the needs of blockchain mining. We might see more rapid growth in the technology because of the huge influx in profit and inevitably research dollars that these companies now have.",fdkcs93,2020-01-09 01:32:21,4

LN was born out of the belief that Bitcoin needed to scale in orders of magnitude in order to facilitate small, daily transactions.

Price may be influenced by content and length.

**Other Important Info:**

\- I charge 5$ extra for outfit requests. I also charge an additional 5$ PER any alterations to makeup or hairstyle or shoes.

Currently I usually start shows in just a low cut tank top/Tshirt and

panties or lingerie or i cycle through different types of lingere each day. If you want a little more, I offer

lots of different lingerie, sports wear, or normal clothes and shoes. But im always wearing something sexy.

\- I also Charge a 5$ increase per 10 mins on group shows as they require more organization and prep on my end.

\- I do not start my shows naked.

\- I have a standing rule that I call 'Three Strikes, you are out' Which means, I do not keep clients on my list

who pry, or make repeated contact but no payment, time wasters or rudeness. I understand things happen and

sometimes arrangements don't work out.. But i also think three chances is plenty. If after three chances you

find yourself unable to contact me and are unsure why, In all likeliness you have been blocked. This also applies

to clients who have paid before/have become regulars. The only way to become unblocked is to submit a payment

through my ad, (including your skype ID) and then i will unblock you and contact you for a show to avoid wasted time.

\- I also BLOCK without warning for the following reasons....Calling without payment, Unsolicited pictures,

dishonesty about payment, and asking for free shows, pictures etc. If you find yourself unable to contact

me after having done any of these things, Please follow the steps above in my 'Three Strikes, you are out'

Rule to become unblocked. Although you may earn the privilege to be unblocked, previous offenders are kept

on very short leashes and second time offenders are never forgiven. We are all adults, so act like it.

\- I always show as online on Skype because i am signed in on multiple devices to make reaching me easier.

If you message me I will get back to you as soon as possible. I however, do not always respond, as i may be

in a show or unavailable. The best way to reach me is messaging me immediately when you are ready to pay for

a show. I can't guarantee times and i don't really work on a schedule.

\- If you submit a payment without talking to me first, the show will be given at a time convenient for both

me and the client.

harda,"Bitcoin Core's policy is to never release opt-in soft fork code in a major release such as 0.20.  They don't want to force users to accept the soft fork just because the users want to get the bug fixes and new features from the major version.  Instead, soft fork code is always released in its own point release (e.g. segwit was [0.13.1](https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.13.1/)).

With that in mind, a taproot soft fork in a 0.20.x version (not including backports) would have to be released after May 2020 (the [expected release date](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17432) for 0.20.0) and November 2020 (+6 months from May, the usual length of a version cycle).  Whether that's plausible is anyone's guess---for things like this where it's critically important to get everything correct, the policy is usually ""release when ready, no matter how long that takes.""",fdoewp1,2020-01-10 06:03:39,1

Gurr3nIsAlive,"Interesting story about the last couple weeks in my family.


So my dad's, coworker's, dad is some really rich oil tycoon fuck, very good with his money, and he told my dad's coworker about this Bitcoin trading website and hooked him up with some day trader. The coworker showed my dad how he had grown $1000 into almost $100,000 in the span of 2 months and he convinced my dad to get into it. While I was positive it was a scam, my dad still made a $250 investment because he felt that was something he wouldn't be in any financial danger if it ended up being a scam. 


Well a week after he made the $250 investment, it had risen to over $2000. My dad and I were still skeptical, so we decided instead of trying to let it keep growing, we would see if we could withdraw that $2000. To both of our surprise, it actually worked without a problem. My dad then pocketed his $250, and invested the rest back in, and within a week he was already sitting at $12,000. I make OK money for my area, but Ive got a lot of debt, so seeing it work the first time and then seeing how quick we were racking up money was such an insane feeling. 


Well my dad went to pull the 12g out because he wanted to start an account for me, and that's where it all fell apart. The guy started ignoring my dad, and knowing his first and last name, he started putting it into every social media he could think of. He managed to get a hit for the guys name on Instagram, and messaged the guy telling him to not be a fucker and stop ignoring him. Come to find out, the guy my dad found on instagram is actually a relatively popular bitcoin influencer/analyst (honestly idk what he actually does, but he seemed popular) and the guy on the trading website was just using his name to convince people he was some well known bitcoin guy.


Anyways, dumb story that no one probably cares about but I aint got none of them friend things to talk to so you all get to suffer lol. In the end everything was fine because my dad managed to get his initial investment back, but I've got to say the whole thing had me hella bummed. I went through a couple different emotional phases, feeling super ecstatic all the way to feeling like this wasn't something I should be doing/didn't earn, but now I actually feel okay knowing it didn't all pan.

**The bad:**

Bitcoin Unlimited actually does not have stake in the game - as in they hold mostly BTC, accept enemy trolls into their ranks and still think that Core will turn around and increase blocksize which is stupid - so clarity of their intentions are questionable.

Wernicke,"Just took a nice stroll down memory lane via Coinbase. I remember when Bitcoin was surging into the hundreds of dollars for the first time asking a friend if I should get some and him saying ""well not now, it just shot up"". And then I forgot about it. Then I heard about ETH and saw the price compared to bitcoin, I thought maybe I had shot at some big mulah. 

First ETH purchase was in June 2017 at $362 USD / ETH. Continued buying all the way down to $149 USD / ETH in July 2017 at which point I wrote it off as my being completely irresponsible and stupid for buying a falling asset with really no knowledge of it or the market. I didn't even know what Ethereum was, except that I had heard it was ""like Bitcoin but better"".I had almost no EXP with crypto. I didn't even know there were crypto communities like this one on forums like reddit. I remember I was abroad in Japan when I got the notification that I was in profit in August 2017. I frantically signed in and tried to sell, and because I was abroad there was an issue with my linked bank and I got a hold inquiry on my CB account for suspicious activity. I thought ETH was so volatile that if I didn't get my money out IMMEDIATELY I might never get the chance again. I was terrified of losing my money. 

Thankfully (or not given the next few months? haha) I got it sorted out and sold at $315 USD / ETH for an extremely mild profit, and was able to fund a few extra awesome excursions during my time in Japan. I totally wrote crypto off as out of my league after that. I then watched the madness of the bubble ensue and wondered if I was destined to be financially tragic. It wasn't greed (well maybe a little greed lol) but genuine interest that brought me back to ETH after that. That crypto bubble was unlike anything I had ever seen and I wanted to understand what was behind it. What I found was really much much more than I expected. I didn't understand the technology, the potential applications, the communities... None of it. 

I am really grateful I didn't completely scare myself off and took the time after the bubble popped to research ETH and get myself more familiar with the crypto market as a whole.

Peter__R,"If you look at the number of nodes _in consensus_, there are already more BU than ABC nodes: https://cashnodes.io.  There are ""zombie nodes"" that didn't bother to upgrade and are thus stuck at the last upgrade point.

#FAST INSTANT TRANSACTIONS

Although most miners use ABC, the fact that much of the network runs BU nodes is very helpful.  For example, the fact that instant transactions are so fast in BCH compared to BTC is because of the BU nodes.  The BU nodes very quickly relay new transactions across the network, such that nearly all of the important nodes on the network learn of new transactions in under 1 second.  Without the BU nodes, instant BCH transactions would be as slow as instant BTC transactions are, because ABC inherited the random delays that Core added to transaction propagation.


The large network of BU nodes will also be key to rolling out the two developments being worked on by Bitcoin Unlimited:  

#LONGER CHAINS OF UNCONFIRMED TRANSACTIONS

Several BU nodes on the network already support longer mempool chains, and wallets that connect to them can already send and receive deeply-chained transactions (e.g., up to chain lengths of 500).  We're in the processes of testing the security of deeply-chained transactions, setting up additional supporting infrastructure, and writing an article to document our work.  Our testing so far shows that long-chains should actually be quite useable and surprisingly secure even if NONE of the miners upgrade their mempool chaining limits.  The BU nodes will act as a ""network-wide mempool"" and push the transactions to the miners and other ABC nodes when they are ready to accept them.  The downside is that very deeply chained transactions won't be mined in the next block (they'll be mined in the one after that, or a later block), so it would be similar to if blocks were full and you needed to wait a while to see the confirmation.

#DOUBLE-SPEND PROOFS

Another initiative we're working on is double-spend proofs.  BU nodes will soon relay proofs that a transactions was double-spent to further improve the security of unconfirmed transactions.  SPV wallets will be able to take advantage of this too, as proofs for the transactions they care about will automatically be relayed to them. Miners relaying double-spend proofs isn't necessary for double-spend proofs to be useful.",fdxoe4g,2020-01-12 04:33:53,10

aescolanus,"That's a reasonable attitude to take, in isolation.  But people don't live in isolation.

Stonetoss is saying positive things about Bitcoin in a witty way with his unique style.  Great.  No problem with that message.  R/bitcoin users look at that positive Bitcoin comic and think ""smart guy, he thinks like me, I like him"".  And they come away with positive feelings about Stonetoss, because that's how people think - they like people similar to them, and they like people who agree with them.

So what happens when r/bitcoin readers see a Stonetoss comic in the future?  They think ""I recognize this style, smart guy, likes Bitcoin, I like him"".  And they're just a little bit more likely to read the new comic and just a little bit more likely to think positively of that new comic.  That positive past association predisposes them to like and trust future comics from Stonetoss.  

But Stonetoss is a literal neo-Nazi.  Hundreds of his comics contain subtle [(or not-so-subtle)](https://imgur.com/gallery/E0umAFU) racist and anti-Semitic messages.  And by giving Stonetoss a platform to spread a message that r/bitcoin readers like and trust, Reddit has given all those readers a bias towards looking at his racist and anti-Semitic comics positively.  And that little positive bias might be enough to push a reader from ""I don't agree with him, but he's funny"" to ""he agrees with me on Bitcoin, maybe his other beliefs are justified too"".  And down the white power ranger rabbit hole they go.  

And this is why deplatforming Nazis is justified - because when someone is known to promote a genuinely dangerous ideology, helping them build a positive reputation with your audience is a fucking horrible idea. 
 There are lots of smart, witty people out there who *aren't* Nazis.  Why not post them, instead of giving a smart, witty Nazi a helping hand?",fdzs5wl,2020-01-12 11:02:05,8

Zandrick,"That’s the point. The second thing you said, anyway. That actually pretty much the definition of fiat currency. It is created by a central organization, and has no value other than because of that organization. Runescape money is printed by Ruenscape and can be traded with other people, but it’s primary value is that it is traded back to Runescape. To buy Runescape stuff, swords and armor or whatever. Where Runescape to vanish tommorow in a puff of smoke, all the value of that money vanishes with it. 

Everyone wants gold. There is no gold god that prints and eats the gold. It just exists, and people use it for stuff, it has use in both art and scientific applications. And, critically, it’s rare. 

Poop from your butt, as you so elegantly put it, has no use, no one wants it. And most importantly, it’s infinite. 

There are three factors here. Where the thing comes from, the rarity of the thing, and it’s use. 

Bitcoin is rare, it’s not infinite, but, it has no use. You can’t stack a bunch of bitcoin into some shape and call it artwork or use it to conduct electrons like gold. People just want it, at least for now. 

To summarize. Bitcoin is kind of like poop from your butt, but not really, while Runescape money is the same as the US dollar.",fe0k3w9,2020-01-12 16:39:30,12

Btw: The question of ""Will merchants use this"" feature is very well answered if you actually try it yourself.

DCinvestor,"Later this cycle, I expect ETH to ""decouple"" in a sense- where ETH may make huge gains on the BTC ratio. I expect this with ETH as the #2 coin by marketcap, although it is only 10% of BTC's current marketcap. This means a little bit of money (comparatively) could pump it very hard and drive FOMO, and in other markets like this (e.g., precious metals), we see #2 assets outperform #1 assets during bullish periods (and conversely, underperform during bearish periods). I'll warn folks as it wouldn't surprise me to see BTC lead such a move before ETH really stands out.

The big difference with ETH this cycle is that I expect Ethereum's fundamentals will grow tremendously over the next two years, while for Bitcoin, I expect them to change less dramatically (aside from continued capital inflow, which arguably *is* a fundamental for Bitcoin if you believe those theses).

So I don't know how the market will react if/when ETH makes big gains on BTC this cycle. At some point, I expect ETH will give back less and less, potentially even reaching a point where the ETH marketcap is greater than BTCs.

Vendor_BBMC,"This is a little off-topic, but hey. Nobody will mind me hijacking this dull thread.

All the marketplace DDOS attacks got me thinking:- We have powerful encrypted messenger apps like WIKR on phones. Could the technology be expanded to also have the features of a marketplace? The data doesn't need to be stored on the handset.

Marketplace data (like listings, profiles, feedback, balances, escrows, orders and photos) doesn't need to update in absolutely real time. Every 10 minutes will do. Why not store it in a decentralised blockchain, which the mobile apps on our phones access like they're mobile bitcoin wallets talking to a blockchain? 

Blockchains have been developed to be ultra-secure and un-hackable. Anyone hosting a copy of the ""blockmarket"" (running a node) could be paid a fee in cryptocurrency from the marketplace, based on it's up-time - like a miners fee. There is NO hosting site to subpoena, or central server to bust. And any vendor/customer chat is automatically encrypted by the keys on their handsets - just like WIKR, telegram, surespot etc

Marketplace admins (who are always a weak-point) could be done away with by allowing the market's users to voluntier for ""jury service"" in return for bitcoin payment from the market's profits. If a vendor and a customer have a dispute, they both state their case and a ""market jury"" of 3 or 5 users decide who gets the money in the escrow, or recommend banning a suspected scam vendor. The community wold be policed by odd-numbered bands of ordinary users. The majority decides.

Just an idea. It would be on android, obviously. Apple would hate it like they hate bitcoin, the fucking dweebs.",fe4w6vm,2020-01-13 06:09:25,16

stevengineer,"Purse.io connects to your metamask wallet and Amazon, and works through the mturks from Amazon who get paid in Amazon gift cards they can't cash out. So you say you want an item for X percent (you can literally set your discount) and then it goes to a marketplace behind the scenes and people trade Amazon gift points for your Eth or Bitcoin, at a discount since you are doing them a service as much we they to you by getting them cash they can use in the real world.

Now normally on large expensive items it can take a while to get selected by someone, so you gotta lower your discount. But in the $50-150 range I can routinely get away with 25-30% discount if I'm willing to wait an extra day or two for my item to arrive. So I often do this.

Now it's not perfect, I seem to lose 5-10% to fees, but it's always a savings anyhow. My best purchase to date was a $600 item for $480.",fe5og51,2020-01-13 08:35:58,11

Maegfaer,"Deflation of any major fiat currency *does* cause an economic collapse, but only because the real value of debts would increase, causing defaults, causing more deflation, causing even more defaults. The spending argument is indeed nonsense, there are plenty of goods that become cheaper every year yet sell very well. People don't wait to buy things that they want because it'll be a few percent cheaper next year. If deflation were consistent you'd be waiting until your life is over and never buy the things you need or want. Obviously that makes zero sense.

In the end, it's all about expectations. Current loans are extended with the expectation and thus conditions that there will be some inflation. Bitcoin loans could be extended in the future with the expectation of some deflation and so different conditions would apply.

Yes, deflation discourages lending compared to inflation and results in less economic activity. But if the current system indeed collapses due to the giant debt bubble that has been created, maybe that means that credit creation *should* be curtailed by deflation to keep the system sustainable. It's very unethical to let future generations pay the heavy price of economic collapse so we can have more growth in the present.",fe5v6ba,2020-01-13 09:34:32,32

If you're bringing someone into Bitcoin Core, you're introducing them to a system which has no potential long term intrinsic value. They have no plan to pay for the security of the network from transaction fees, and as a currency that only supports a few hundred thousand transactions per day, Bitcoin Core has no ability to viably compete with other digital currencies such as Bitcoin Cash, which plans to support everyone who wants to use it.

Bringing someone into Bitcoin Core is setting them up for failure, and therefore will likely do more harm than good in growing adoption of digital currency.",fe9kpkp,2020-01-14 03:04:53,12
Buchloe,"Mostly because the creation of bitcoin is a direct response the how the actions of the elite in the system benefit only them,  while wreaking havoc on the lower class. A news headline about the bailouts were directly coded into it so that we remember. Bitcoin was created directly to divert the power of the banks and government, who are seen as siphoning wealth from the rest of society. It's limited in supply,  which an Austrian concept. Inflation, bailouts, and derivatives affected all of us negatively not so long ago, and many of us are concerned that the problem was only pushed down the road,  and that it will come back far, far worse than it got during the recession.  And seeing how Austrian thought criticizes the behaviors we see as leading to those catastrophes,  most of us who want to avoid the impact of future recessions and depressions look to the advice of the ""Austrans"": Save assets that can't be inflated (bitcoin in this case).  Save more than you spend. Protect your savings from inflation. Hedge against government and banking corruption.

The market is retarded because there's still 4 Bitcoin clones in the top 100, totalling an $8B market cap.

&gt; A Singaporean businessman facing cheating charges here was allegedly kidnapped and tortured in Thailand last week.

&gt; Despite paying his captors more than $60,000 in Bitcoin for his freedom, Mark Cheng Jin Quan, 32, claimed they were still going to execute him at gunpoint until he managed to escape.

&gt; The blockchain adviser with Singapore fintech company X Infinity said he reported the kidnapping to Thai police last Friday, hours after his escape.

&gt; He was worried about his Singaporean acquaintance, Kim Lee Yao Wei, 31, who had also been kidnapped after accompanying him on the business trip to Thailand.

&gt; But in a dramatic twist yesterday, the Royal Thai Police told a press conference that Lee was the alleged mastermind of the kidnapping and had been arrested and charged with robbery, illegal detention, physical assault and illegal possession of firearms.

&gt; FOUR CHARGES

&gt; Cheng was slapped with one charge under the Securities and Futures Act and three charges for criminal breach of trust in the State Courts here last year.

&gt; He is alleged to have dishonestly misappropriated more than $300,000 belonging to an investments company in 2014.

&gt; Cheng was given bail of $120,000 for permission to go to Thailand and Malaysia for work-related matters last Wednesday.

&gt; He reportedly arrived at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok with Lee, whom he knew through Bitcoin dealings, on Thursday morning.

&gt; Cheng claimed Lee had persuaded him to go to Thailand and negotiate a business deal with some locals.

&gt; They took a private taxi at the airport and later stopped at a petrol kiosk along the way at Lee's suggestion, Cheng told Chinese evening daily Lianhe Wanbao.

&gt; At the kiosk, a group of masked men allegedly grabbed and bundled them into a nearby car. They were then blindfolded, beaten and drugged.

&gt; Over the next 12 hours, he was taken to four different locations in forested areas where he was tortured, Cheng told Wanbao.

&gt; ""They took off my clothes, splashed ice water on me and gave me electric shocks. They demanded that I hand over US$1 million (S$1.3m) in Bitcoin,"" he said.

&gt; But he told them he could give them only 1.4 million baht (S$62,400) in Bitcoin. After he paid them, they took him to a hut in a padi field where they pointed a gun at his head.

&gt; He had earlier heard men digging what he believed to be a grave, he told Wanbao.

&gt; ""One of them held the gun against the back of my head while the others stepped away.

&gt; ""Fortunately, I know martial arts. I reached behind my head and grabbed the pistol, and then I fled,"" he said.

&gt; Royal Thai Police spokesman Colonel Krisana Pattanacharoen said a good Samaritan picked up Cheng at the side of the road and took him to Ongkharak Police Station, some 60km from Bangkok, where he made a report at about 7.30am last Friday, Thai news outlet Siam Rath reported.

&gt; Colonel Krisana added that Lee was arrested on Sunday in a Bangkok hotel after a manhunt.

&gt; Mr Chano Pemberger, a 24-year-old Thai actor, who allegedly owns the car used in the kidnapping, is currently a person of interest in the case, Thai news outlet Sanook reported.

&gt; Cheng is still shocked by the revelation that Lee had allegedly masterminded the kidnapping, Wanbao reported.

&gt; ""I didn't expect my friend to be involved. I really don't know who I can trust now,"" he said.

&gt; Cheng, who claims he is currently under police protection in a safe house in Thailand, is expected to testify in Lee's trial at a later date.

&gt; Cheng, who co-founded Avelife, a non-governmental organisation that focuses on social enterprise and the environment, is the first Singaporean to win the Queen's Young Leaders Award in 2016 for his involvement in environmental initiatives.

&gt; It is not known if he will return to Singapore for his next court hearing on Feb 3.

jenbanim,"Nowadays it's not really right to say that Linux is fundamentally more secure than Windows. In both cases, as long as you're frequently updating and only running trusted software, you should be fine.

While Linux desktops have a smaller, more tech-savvy userbase, I don't think this is a major reason why it's more secure. Outside of desktops, Linux absolutely dominates the market share. The vast majority of cellphones, websites, and embedded systems run Linux. There's ample reason to target Linux with malware, and plenty of attempts have been made.

The real reason (imho) Linux is *generally* more secure than Windows is that it is built to make best-practices easy. By default, you're going to be installing software from a trusted central repository rather than browsing the web and downloading the first result that pops up on Google. That software is also going to be open source, which is not a guarantee of safety, but it massively reduces the risk of bad actors, like the time uTorrent decided to start running bitcoin miners on everyone's computers. Likewise, updates are quick and painless, which means there's very little incentive to put them off.

That's my take at least. To be perfectly honest I don't actually know much about Windows security. So take this with a grain of salt.",feep0km,2020-01-15 06:43:32,2

It is less ambitious in its 'feature' upgrades while allowing bigger blocks now.  This makes it (keeps it) a bit closer to what bitcoin used to be.  It is for those who think 'BCH is changing too fast' and '1MB blocks in BTC is crazy'.

Disclaimer: That is just my impression.

TechCynical,"Not very different based on the whitepaper for the LN. Your right however it's not comparable since the decentralization in today's LN is far more centralized than bch today in anyway. And yes bch can do LN you living under a rock? It's implementable and cheaper to run than btc and it's LN start up costs. And btc is far more centralized given its 1mb blocksize where fees can rack up so big you can buy an entire hard drive to store the blockchain with the amount in fees you pay over a few transactions. 

Personally I think it all sucks and none will succeed long term. They're all shitcoins including btc and only have a name brand to keep them alive.

If you want real p2p cash then visit nano who's decentralization only gets stronger the more people use it. And who's voting power at one point a month ago was so distributed it was more decentralized than bitcoin in governance.",fehnxop,2020-01-16 05:32:56,1

Chytrik,"And then what? Some subset of nodes on the minority chain network would agree on a checkpoint at some point in the past. The attacker would then cause havoc at the chain tip: the checkpoint would not stop this from happening. BCH has gained no meaningful security by doing this, just marketing value (supposed ‘protection’, which is in fact false). 

Note that Bitcoin-core has deprecated checkpoint functionality in newer versions, to be replaced by the `assumevalid` command option.

rbrunner7,"If you mean the ""official"" Monero GUI wallet: No, it doesn't do multisig.

As far as I know only the CLI wallet and Exa Wallet support multisig, and the latter only between instances of itself, i.e. no interoperability between the CLI wallet and Exa Wallet as far as multisig is concerned.

The RPC server also offers the necessary calls for doing multisig, but then you basically have to write your own wallet on top of those calls :)

LovinglyRoughDomme,"# 👾 YOUR FIRST TASK IS TO READ THIS ENTIRELY: The sessions I offer are different from your usual ones

We will spend part of session time candidly discussing your boundaries, desires, and kinks - this is vital for our mutual enjoyment. If you have something specific in mind, let Me know in your initial message; a list of your kinks and limits is also a good place to start. Our sessions will all begin with guided conversation discussing such things. Be honest with Me and I will be honest with you. Do not be disrespectful to or of Me and I will honor your submissive nature.

# 👾 I never show My face unless I decide to do so

But, it is My absolute favorite thing to watch those I Dominate while in session with them. The visual is very exciting for Me. I don't require it during our sessions, but I adore seeing the effects of My words. If you wish to see Me the best way is to subscribe to My [Onlyfans](https://onlyfans.com/mistresskena) or [AVN](https://stars.avn.com/mistresskena).

# 👾 About Me

I do enjoy more overtly erotic kinky conversations, but need to get acquainted with a submissive first. Connection is of the utmost importance to Me. I have been involved in the D/s lifestyle for over 15 years and have known My Dominant side for almost as long. I am polyamorous and pansexual. Vanilla-wise I am very into video and board games, movies, swimming, dancing salsa, and pizza.

The connection and mental aspect of Domination is what I am all about. I want to partake in mutually beneficial activities and really get to know you and see how our kinks and interests line up. If you have found your past experiences to be fun yet empty, perhaps it is time to spend time with Me. Lets connect.

I usually hate playing the fallacy card, but you're putting forward a combination of a strawman and false dichotomy. Just as it is possible to believe that veterans should receive proper benefits and treatment while also believing military expenditures should be sharply reduced, so too is it possible to think that Bitcoin is an interesting and innovative digital currency implementation while also believing that the existence of a Federal Reserve (or, more generally, a lender of last resort) is ideal.",fehq2ch,2020-01-16 05:53:25,1

CannedCaveman,"Thanks! Fees are 1sat/b for weeks now, but who cares about facts right?

Watchtowers are for Lightning and not Bitcoin, the same goes for channel factories. LN is just a tool and can be implemented on other chains as well, even on BCH!

If you want to run your own full node then you can buy a Raspberry Pi4 and a cheap 1 TB Hdd, so for under $100! I can link you to an online store if you want.

But again, who cares about facts right? Especially if you are willing to give up censorship resistance, decentralization and immutability for a temporary fix for lower fees. 

Apparently you think fees are the problem in the current financial system and not the fact that we have to trust central banks and governments to not fuck up our money like they do now. You just jump to a world where you need to trust miners with huge serverfarms to tell you what the Bitcoin supply is and how many Bitcoin you own.

Wewanotherthrowaway,"&gt;The foundation of libertarianism is you are free to enjoy what you want to enjoy and other people are free to enjoy what they want to enjoy.

That's exactly what's occuring in cancel culture.

&gt;That's why they like stuff like bitcoin so that paypal cant tell you 'we don't like you buying that ' and blocking their payment.

Exactly. They don't like paypal, so they don't give them business. If paypal pulled something especially egregious, they'd get cancelled.

&gt;You get freedom, you accept that you shouldnt use that to curb the freedom of others just because they like something you don't like.

Bitcoin was up 100% last year.  It's up 15% already this year.  We've been in a bull market for a year and will be in a bull market until the end of 2021.  Stop calling every little pullback from spikes caused by stupid shorts covering (which is what happened from April-June last year and what is happening now) a ""bear market"" and your life will be much more enjoyable.  

Bitcoin bears get slaughtered.  Sure, they have their periods of fun, but those periods are extremely expensive.  Just ask the guy who dumped it by selling 35,000 BTC for a million bucks.  I'm sure that was very fun for him.  He probably felt extremely powerful for a couple months.  But in the end, the enemies of Bitcoin get rekt.

Ant-n,"&gt;This is a perfectly correct opinion. Adoption is very important. The question is only, what is the use case. And what use cases can be solved in a sustainable way (= ledger doesn't grow too fast). However, during ""normal"" times, like currently, a Bitcoin transaction is with high probability settled with lowest fees (1-3 sat / byte) within 1-2 hours. That means, paying $0.02 - 0.20 Dollar for a transaction.

Problem of BTC is reliability.

Tx price and confirmation time are unreliable.

Even though they are acceptable today, they can go the thought the roof tomorrow in case of even a marginal increase tx demand.

That why steam, microsoft, tether all turned away from crypto.

BTC is not a good tool as a mean of exchange and it loss adoption for it.

&gt;	And what use cases can be solved in a sustainable way (= ledger doesn’t grow too fast). 

There is none, blockchain are permissionless, if you want a garanteed small ledger, you have to restrict capacity.

It will come with a cost (high cost) therefore your chain will give in any use case that rely on low cost.

Typical disruption come from producing a service at much lower cost than before.



&gt;Bitcoin and Monero are very good stores of value, although they are currently not the best solution for micropayments (&lt; $10) in case the whole world used them for every payment (scaling impossible). I’m talking about billions of people doing multiple daily transactions.

Honestly we don’t know.

It is just the beginning, while I cannot see BTC scaling to wordwide use simply because of development choices and Monero because it is more ressources intensive, I can see BCH (and Bitcoin as it was first envisioned) 

Lot of optimization are possible to reach massive scale on BCH.. **and** very importantly that would bring huge fee revenue toward PoW and make it sustainable when block reward will be over.

Unfortunately not many people seem interested in long term sustainability in crypto it seems.



&gt;Would I ever want to store value in Ethereum? No! Because it’s maybe a world computer, but it’s not a store of value. Ethereum reminds me a lot of projects like SETI@Home, but it’s not «  digital gol » ». And when they give up the Eth 1.0 blockchain, because it is too large in a few years, it will leave a catastrophic scratch in the bran«  « Ether »um » a.k.a. VitalikCoin.

What is the problem here? I don’t think ETH was ever built as a store of value?

But if you ask me, I would not discard ETH so quick, it see a huge amount of usage and adoption.. it can very be one of the first cryptocurrency project to be more value on usage than speculation, that would make it a good store of value. You don’t want to rely on speculation alone for a store of value.

&gt;Yes, but for pruned nodes it is only a 51% attack for a short piece of the tip of the blockchain, so much easier.

No, as I said before a pruned node fully verify data before it deleting it.

Such attack wouldn’t work.

Although it would work on a BTC node on default setting and a node using UTXO commitment.



&gt;Rather unlikely scenario.

&gt;Yes, 99% unlikely. But you see why Bitcoin was invented... attacking Bitcoin and Monero is 100% unlikely.

It is possible to prune monero node too

&gt;A miner that own 51% of the network hash rate can basically decide what goes in the chain or not.

&gt;Yes. But what is the motivation of the miner, to control it? At least no economic incentives. This is actually why fees are important: Fee pressure ensures that miners are constantly including as many transactions as they can. If transactions are too cheap, it makes the network less censorship resistant.

&gt;Maybe if a dystopian state was a 51% miner, it would do that for political enemies. But since serious crypto projects are internationally distributed, it is hardly doable for a single s’ate’s political party to control 51% of international hash power.

Then miner should be as decentralized as possible.

High fee prevent small miner from participating and heavily impact negatively mining decentralization (when your payout is $10 worth of BTC then a $1 fee can be enugh to ear up all your profit)

&gt;Yes, we currently see centralization of PoW hashrate in countries with cheap energy, but we will see how it develops in the future. This trend was like everything in this game, a predictable development.

This trend is unavoidable I agree.

High fee make it worst by making small participants unprofitable.

&gt;The risk with 51% is not that a miner will reverse a transaction (he can only reserve transactions he own the private key from)

&gt;51% attacks rewrite history, whole blocks become invalid. History is rewritten for everyone that had settled transactions in the attacked blocks.

The attacker can reject a confirmed transaction that’s correct, not steal your coin. The miner would need your private key for that.


&gt;He can blacklist transactions, cancel transactions, change the network characteristics (basically activate any soft fork he want	..  
&gt;  
&gt;**and** you node will accept it, because he will be producing a valid chain.

&gt;’hat’s true. But I’don’t care so much. As long as my node can prevent hardforks’ it’s fine.

It is a soft fork, by definition a 51% produce a valid chain.

That’s why it is dangerous, because all node will accept the new chain.



&gt;I think we all know that Bitcoin and Monero have a few critical characteristics like mining reward curve / halving, block size constraints, and so on that must not be changed without consensus. As long as a 51% attacker cannot change these properties’ it’s worth running a node.

Correct a 51% is basically a soft fork made without consensus pushed by a single entity.

That why they are dangerous.

&gt;The question is, is a pruned node enough or should it be a full node’ It’s a matter of personal opinion. Of course you can « ay « there are enthusiasts that will always run full  »odes ». Yes, maybe that’s true. But maybe I feel safer running my own full node.

Ok but making the whole network unreliable and killing his potential worth it?

If really auditing the chain has to be cheap, why not reducing the block limit further? 250GB is already a lot.

And what is your opinion on BTC not verify the whole blockchain data? Did you change your settings? (Data is actually not verified here, much worst for security than pruning)

&gt;In my opinion the current state of science and technology allow for 2 types of crypto currencies: Sustainable store of value (Bitcoin, Monero, Grin, ...) and unsustainable super fast, super cheap digital cash. I think it is better to choose the sustainable solution, because crypto currencies are meant to run forever and not only for 10 or 20 years until they collapse.

I strongly disagree BTC choice of low capacity is a sustainable choice.",fekc5dm,2020-01-17 02:49:28,1

brianddk,"&gt; what are the best ways to invest bitcoin

Well there is a way focused on ""risk"" and there is one focused on ""stability""

These two are mutually exclusive.  The smartest approach is one that has a blend and balance of risk and reward.  The ""most return"" will require the absolute most risk.

The most risk will be to mortgage your house and and take out a maximum leveraged position.

The least risk (while staying with bitcoin) would be to [DCA over many years](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/enesw7/a_theoretical_look_at_the_last_1000_days_of_dca/).  But that won't get you near the types of returns most are looking for.",fekdc0r,2020-01-17 03:01:06,1

The thing is that price in/deflation only happens with supply in/deflation if all other things are equal. Bitcoin is only price deflationary if the Bitcoin economy is growing compared to the rest. In a global single Bitcoin economy, there won't be any price deflation.

Just like in our dollar/euro economy there wouldn't be any price inflation if it wasn't for the supply inflation due to monetary policy.

So in a global economy without supply changes, prices would be stable. So purchasing power wouldn't change.",feke0d7,2020-01-17 03:07:54,1
solarguy2003,"You're not wrong....

Dash has InstantSend that works today.

Bitcoin has the Lightning network that *might* catch on *someday* despite the fact that the economic game theory won't help that adoption rate at all.

Dash has optional on-chain privacy mixing and you can choose how mixed it is.

Bitcoin just doesn't have that.  You could use some 3rd party mixing service, if you trust *them.*

Dash is self funded through the treasury.

Bitcoin kinda ran on donations and generosity until Blockstream took them over.  Blockstream, perhaps coincidentally, is full of banksters. 

BitCoin prevents 51% attacks by.....ummm........hoping for the best from their mining community.  It's not like anybody ever threatened to burn BitCoin to the ground through a mining war.  Oh wait.........Craig Wright did that.

Dash invented Chainlocks, and now Dash is effectively immune to 51% attacks.  This allows Dash the luxury of discussing how much and what kind of mining we really want and need to keep the Dash blockchain secure without wasting resources/electricity/money.  

Dash transactions are very cheap, and designed to stay that way.

Bitcoin transaction costs are volatile, depending on how clogged up the mem pool is.  You didn't want to buy coffee with Bitcoin anyway, did you?

Dash has an actual governance mechanism.  We solved the ""double the block size"" question in a day and never looked back.  

Bitcoin argued about it very publicly for two years and damaged their reputation repeatedly and never did solve the problem.  So the community split over it.  And then split over it again.  

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong here, I got into the space because of Bitcoin.  Long may she live.  BitCoin is not the enemy of Dash. Our use cases have become very different.  BitCoin is 186 times better than most of the funny money printed by governments out there.

As for PCs being cheaper in the long run. I would have agreed with you maybe 8 years ago. Today’s game requirements, especially for AAA, are really heavy. To build a PC for just today’s standards you’ll definitely need to spend around 1000. Sure you can build a PC for less and play today’s games, but they’ll run like ass in that case. And the standards keep raising every year. It’s just updating a GPU every few years, but RAM and CPU requirements keep getting heavier every year as well. Sure it’s not like it’ll be every year you’ll need to upgrade, but it’s not like 8 years ago when you only need to upgrade like every 5 years. And the Processors and Graphics cards that release? They’re expensive, and it’s hard to find some good prices as their value keeps going all over the place thanks to bitcoin miners. Sure you can find some relatively good GPUs and processors for a cheap price, but then you run into the problem of the PC running the games like ass.

We've seen a move away from Unity and Gaming and a leaning into developers ""proving themselves"" by integrating KIN.    


Unity has templates and tons of shared code and so does stack overflow.  In the world I live in, people open source and share enough for a divergent mind to create value and add it to the system without hundreds of thousands in capital or forced to abandon creative problem solving and game building.  Even the new Unity ECS system which blows most current apps out of the water in terms of performance has a script-less system like Playmaker that was used as the most downloaded add-on for Unity in object oriented programming.  That's my world.

Neophyte-,"privacy coins are the only types of coins that should be used for payment imo. think of this scenario, if you use bitcoin to buy something at a walk in shop, they know your wallet address and can see if you're a btc millionare. your wallet is publicly visible. even if you have multiple wallets and your jackpot is in another one its easily traceable if someone is motivated.

RYO imo is a crappy coin. its a fork of SUMO which was a failure. RYO now its very similar to XMR except it has a larger ring size 20 something vs 11 for XMR. 11 is enough. fee structure is slightly different. the active development of XMR and the network effect means XMR wins again. for anyone accepting XMR i doubt they would switch to RYO or add it, its not really used at all for payment. XMR is barely used as it is. as goes with adoption of payment coins in general, its just worse for privacy coins at this time.

fyi there are two ""types"" of private payment coinsm, cryptonote (xmr, ryo, sumo, etc) and Zerocoin (zcash, bitcoin private?, etc) 

there is the exception of using stablecoins for payment, like DAI, as they are suitable for actual spending since they are not volatile. could a private stablecoin exist? perhaps, but it would incur a cost to create it higher than for e.g. DAI/MakerDaO.",fep28o6,2020-01-18 10:21:44,3

Pasttuesday,"Some examples of funds I have locked up - 

I own both eth and wbtc (wrapped bitcoin on ethereum so you can be exposed to bitcoin price but able to use it on ethereum). I’m not sure which is going to make a bigger run when the bull starts, and maybe it’ll just chop around for a long time. I can’t earn much interest on eth or wbtc, so I take an equal fiat dollar amount of each and interact with uniswaps smart contract to become a liquidity provider. I “lock” up the equal fiat amounts of eth and wbtc and others when trading in and out of each use my liquidity to trade. I earn a portion of trading fees here. You can do this with any pair of tokens on ethereum - BAT/LINK, ETH/DAI etc. 

I used my eth as collateral on makerdao to take out a loan in dai to be margin long on eth. I’ve also used the dai to sell for fiat on Coinbase to pay a few bills as I wanted to stay exposed to eth instead of selling. A portion of my crypto buys each month go towards dai now to pay off that loan. When I have it paid off I can “unlock” my eth. 

I have some eth “locked” up in token sets. Tokensets is a smart contract which automatically utilizes popular trading strategies trying to maximize eth returns without needing babysit the trades. Sets include trades between dai and eth and btc and eth. Think there may be others but those are the ones I’m aware of. Popular trading sets trade on the MACD or something (I don’t know much about trading strategies but it’s been good so far)

I don’t have eth locked, but I have dai locked in pool together. You can earn interest on dai on compound.finance or fulcrum. Pool together is a no loss lottery. How it works is people “lock” up their dai, and all the dai that’s put into the smart contract is then used to get interest. Each week the smart contract randomly draws a ticket. Each dai you put in is 1 ticket. If you win, that weeks interest earned from all the dai put into the smart contract is awarded to the person who owns the ticket drawn. If you don’t win, your dai is automatically put towards the next weeks drawing. You can withdraw at any time.",fesboc5,2020-01-19 01:06:19,7

nodecache,"Halvening feeds into a market cycle, it matters a lot, but the date doesn't to anyone but speculators.  What happens on the date of the halvening?  I'm not going to do the math, but I'll still assert a butterfly flapping its wings in the Amazon has a bigger effect on market supply (as in the amount of bitcoin actually available for purchase) on that particular day.  

New issuance has less and less to do with the amount of bitcoin available to buy every day, not just every every halving.  The vast, vast majority of supply available to buyers is coming from market participants who are choosing to sell or not, not from miners covering costs.  New btc issuance is $16 million today while reported volume even adjusted down to filter out over-reporting from bad exchanges is billions.  Even in 2018's bear market, reports were that unreported OTC volume was several multiples of reported exchange volume.

Further, look at the price action from the bottom of the 2014 crash to the prehalving runup and the post halving crash in 2016 and it looks very similar to the price action we've already had from the bottom of the 2018 crash to the top of the 2019 recovery and correcting from there.  Bitcoin dominance during this time period also supports that a lot of frontrunning against the halving speculators has already happened.  

I very much believe (and have since the fall: https://twitter.com/cachenode/status/1185283295053004801 ) we're getting close to the early 2017 portion of the price action.  Recent ratio action is at least suggestive that the engine to drive those lovely early 2017 ratio moves is turning over as we speak.  At the end of my link, from october, I said watch the btc.d chart for confirmation.  [It finally confirmed a h&amp;s with a target that would breach a 2 year supporting trend.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/viIk87x3/)  If btc.d doesn't bounce off that trend and actually reaches the target, revenge of the alts will ensue.

Will the btc price rise around the halving?  I would imagine so, but it matters whether that's the type of rise that happened in early 2017 where alts outperformed massively, or whether it's the type of rise from the 2016 halving.  Twitter and reddit seem to be expecting a 2016 style rise.  I think that particular move already happened.",fetq7ix,2020-01-19 05:11:35,9

ptblazer,"Happy to address these, as I know it.  


&gt;Stellar Foundation holds ~60% of all XLM in existence, creating a central point of failure and strong degree of centralization risk for the project writ large

I can understand why this is concerning to people, but you can read more about the Stellar mandate [here](https://www.stellar.org/foundation/mandate) on how those XLM will be used.  There is also some comfort (in my opinion) knowing that SDF is organized as a non-profit, so there are no founders/investors entitled to share of profits. 


&gt;Network contains only ~35 validators which are heavily centralized around SDF nodes creating network-wide vulnerability

Actually, the list you link shows closer to 80.  I agree that it could still improve though! And 2019 was great in this regard.  Keep in mind also that unlike POW protocols, which require a lot of validators to decentralize the network, the total number of validators needed on Stellar is significantly lower.  


Second, I wouldn't put too much weight on those other articles, without going in to too much detail... they are just outdated.  As stated, ""the figure shows the structure of the quorum slices on January 22, 2019.""  However, A LOT has changed over the last year, including major steps in decentralization.  Today, the network has decentralized away from SDF's validators, as recently discussed [here](https://www.stellar.org/blog/a-look-back-and-a-look-forward-for-2020/) by SDF in their year-end blog looking back on 2019 (""This group of Tier 1 validators is mature enough at this point that we could turn off our nodes and the network would keep going!"") and recently [here] (https://stellar.expert/blog/stellarexpert-validators-quorum-set) by one of those Tier 1 validator operators (""When the Stellar mainnet was deployed, most of the validators depended on the SDF quorum set, delegating voting power to SDF. Now it is a fully decentralized network."")

&gt;Small team (~7) control the majority of the development work

SDF is much larger than that... according Denelle's blog, which is linked above, ""SDF has grown fivefold [in 2019]- up from 11 to 56 employees.""


&gt;No financial incentive (like a mining reward in the Bitcoin protocol) to become a node, which could lead to a dearth of nodes and node centralization

It's comparatively cheap to run a validator b/c of the significantly less energy that's needed, and while its true that there is no direct financial incentive (i.e. mining), there are incentives.  A business building on Stellar has major incentives to help secure the network that its business depends on, and compared to Bitcoin validators (whose only incentive is financial), these validators become much better partners.   Not to disparage the miners on Bitcoin, but the big ones have largely been anything but good partners.  In my opinion, due in full because of how the incentives work on POW protocols.

&gt;Questionable response by the Stellar team to disclose a bug that was discovered (and patched) in 2017

Is this (below) the questionable response you're referring to?  This is what is given as their response in the link you provided.  I guess I fail to see what's questionable about that. 

""We mentioned it twice, in fact, in the notes, and we were very clear the bug had been exploited. From there, we took the additional step of burning Lumens to “true up"" the supply, so that current $XLM owners wouldn’t be diluted and our projected total supply would remain accurate. We recognize that Stellar has since become significant financial software, and our disclosure standards have grown to reflect that reality. There’s been no notable bug since, and if there were we would disclose it in full detail as soon as it was patched. As we announced last month in our 2019 Roadmap we have already committed to a full accounting of all of SDF’s Lumens by the end of the year, and more details around this old bug were going to be (and still will be) part of that.”",fev5qg4,2020-01-19 09:23:54,8

aaj094,"Halving and whether it is or can get 'priced in' always fascinates me to no end when i think about it. So here is a scenario:

Supposing there is a community who consumes tomatoes. They obtain a regular supply from farms and thus there is a certain price for the tomatoes prevailing. Today, news arrives that half of the farms will stop producing tomatoes from 4 months later. Now the price of tomatoes would be expected to go up immediately but consider why. It is because the community consumes tomatoes and manywould like to buy more today itself so that they can keep the tomatoes in their freezers and thus be able to maintain their consumption even after the supply becomes insufficient to provide for the whole community. It is the rich guys inthe community who become willing to pay more today to be able to stock up today's supply for later. Note also that this argument works because tomatoes are a consumption good i.e they get eaten up and disappear from the earth.

Now back to Bitcoin. We know certain demand exists today and we know new supply halves after four months. But bitcoin is not a consumption good. It never disappears like tomatoes (forget lost wallets, etc). There is no reason for existing demand to suddenly want to stack up more Bitcoin now other than for greater speculation purposes. Therefore, even if halving is known to be arriving, the price dicated by current interaction of demand and supply has no definitive reason to want to stack up more Bitcoin unlike the tomatoes case. Even if they do, they will release this Bitcoin as sales after the price reaches higher. In general, Bitcoin is held by people as a % of their portfolio and such allocation is usually a fixed investor preference. When halving finally does come, the new demand that comes in daily (and continues to aim to allocate a % to their portfolio) now has fewer new coins to get and therefore must bid up prices to get bitcoin from existing holders. This is what will cause rise of price post halving.

'Pricing in' of post halving price can only occur if a large part of the demand today actively increases their risk preference and takes on a higher % of bitcoin into their overall portfolio. THis is not the same as the behavior of folks who bid tomatoes higher so thatthey can store and preserve their ability to consume them. In my opinion, risk preferences of asset holders as a whole do not just change suddenly due to even known events in the market. The tomato bidders were not taking on risk, just ensuring their ability to consume whereas if bitcoin is to have halving priced in now, you have to make a very bold assumption that existing Bitcoin demand has a coordinated move of taking on higher risk by accepting higher % of bitcoin in their portfolios for a few months prior to halving. This could happen but then it will be termed as something similar to what happens in Bitcoin bubbles and not a normal reaction of the market to known information.

TLDR - I don't see the possibility of Bitcoin halving being 'priced in' as being in the same league as consumption commodity prices adjusting upwards immediately when a future supply shock becomes known.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:

Another simple way to see why, 'pricing in' of halving, if it occurs, is of bubble form is to see this:

If the price pre halving does reach what is anticipated as the fair price dicated by interaction of demand vs post halving supply then then the big holders could easily dump their stacks at the 'priced in' price and this dump combined with the non halved pre halving supply will immediately cause a crash. This demonstrates that if at all price tries to catch up now with what should be post halving price, it is necessarily a very unstable price that could crash down any time. This again shows that 'pricing in' even of known future supply shocks is not a natural market reaction for an investment good like Bitcoin.",fezr6tp,2020-01-20 04:03:37,7

dehydratedbagel,"Gotta be way more than that. Just look at a bitcoin richlist and look at wallets that haven't moved anything in like 10 years. I find it hard to believe that someone who bought bitcoin in 2010 for a penny would still be holding 100 pct of it as it surpasses $20k.

here are just a few with no transactions out since very early in bitcoin's history: 

https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/12ib7dApVFvg82TXKycWBNpN8kFyiAN1dr (31k BTC)

https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/1FeexV6bAHb8ybZjqQMjJrcCrHGW9sb6uF (80k BTC)

https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/1LdRcdxfbSnmCYYNdeYpUnztiYzVfBEQeC (54k BTC)

&gt;More value being transferred on BCH than on ETH

You cannot compare UTxO based coins, like Bitcoin, with account based coins, like Ethereum, on this metric. A lot of the volume of the former comes from change addresses, which don't exist on the latter.

&gt;Yesterday, the amount of BCH value transferred was over 25% of the value transferred on BTC.

cryptos4pz,"I agree with the spirit of your post! It reminds me of a recent story from [Peter Schiff](https://www.youtube.com/user/SchiffReport/featured), whom I listen to regularly (he's libertarian and genius on politics and economics/banking; not so smart on Bitcoin). Anyway Peter mentioned he got in trouble with the IRS, which is unusual because he, unlike [his father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irwin_Schiff) who died in jail protesting the government, complies with the tax system.

One year he forgot to file a single form. He had put a house in a trust for his kid and forgot to file the correct tax form, or at least his accountant did. The IRS fined him $200,000! He wasn't evading taxes and the property showed up elsewhere too if I recall, but it was a simple honest mistake, a clerical error. Anyway when he got the news he asked his tax lawyer if he'd heard of the 8th Amendment. Here is the text:

*Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.*

Peter said if a $200,000 fine for not filing a single form wasn't an example of an excessive fine in violation of the 8th Amendment he didn't know what was. So he wrote back to the IRS and said he'd keep listeners updated. He said he didn't want to but was prepared to fight the matter up to the Supreme Court if needed, noting that if he was successful it would be a win for all Americans because it would set precedent and relieve them similarly. 

Many Americans just don't know the law and power they have, so the gov just runs roughshod over them.",ff1tu7x,2020-01-20 11:07:28,6

jstolfi,"Some of the funniest events, in no particular order:

Jeff Epstein, alleged billionaire and notorious child sex trafficker, was jailed on new charges and died in jail before it could testify against its accomplices and clients.  But, still, it came out that he was a bitcoin fan and a big donor to the MIT Media Lab, in spite of MIT having a ban against his donations.  Media Lab director Joi Ito, one of  the early investors in Blockstream, had to resign after leaked emails showed him telling his financial officer to hide Jeff's donations to the Lab from the MIT trustees.   Not clear how Jeff's death and Ito's resignation will impact the Digital Currency Initiative (DCI), a research project hosted at the Lab and funded by unknown donors, which pays the salary of Core's chief developer Wladimir Van Der Laan.

Canadian exchange QuadrigaCX collapsed in mostly the standard way; except that owner Gerald Cotten, instead of simply fleeing like Cryptsy's Paul Vernon, died unexpectedly in India during a honeymoon trip.  Allegedly, the private keys to QCX wallets, holding more than 200 M CAD in clients' coins, were known only to him. However, investigations showed that he had squandered most of the clients' bitcoins and dollars in bungled speculations.  Disgruntled clients asked for his body to be exhumed and examined, to make sure that it is indeed his.

Australian big-time tax ~~fraudster~~ miner Craig S. Wright claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto and produced tons of falsified evidence to prove it.  He left Australia days before his home was raided by the Aussie police, and convinced online gambling baron Calvin Ayre to back his new cryptocurrency company, nChain, in return for the promise of hundreds of patents on cryptocurrency technology.

A complicated investment scam called TheDAO was created in 2016, using  Ethereum's smart contract mechanism.  Billions in ETH were invested into it, including by Vitalik and major ETH miners.  Then a hacker exploited a bug in the smart contract and stole most of the coins that had been ""invested"" in it.  Then Vitalik, with support of the major ETH miners, junked the holy ""code is law"" principle and changed the protocol to undo the hack and recover most of the coins. The coin suffered a split over that issue, but the branch that rejected the fork (ETC) currently has only ~~8%~~ 5% of Ethereum's market.  Nevertheless the price of ETH did not suffer because of the fork.  On the contrary, ETH proved to be the ideal vehicle for investment scams, with thousands of new coins created on top of it via smart contracts.

The Church of Bitcoin suffered a major schism in 2017, and the coin split in two:  Bitcoin Core, that claimed the title of ""Bitcoin"" and the ""BTC"" ticker, remained in control of Pope Greg Maxwell;  and Bitcoin Cash, with new ticker BCH, led by heretic Roger ""Bitcoin Jesus"" Ver.  Greg kept the 1 MB block size on BTC, in the hope of it creating a ""fee market"" that was a key ingredient of his plan to reform bitcoin.  BTC traffic hit that limit in early 2016, and the coin became unusable because of unpredictable fees and  delays caused by congestion; but there is no sign of the ""fee market"" yet. BCH has a 32 MB block size limit, but so far it commands only a few percent of bitcoin's traffic and price.  Another schism of BCH, a year later, created  Bitcoin Satoshi Vision or BSV, led by Craig ""Satoshi"" Wright.  One distinguishing feature of BSV is that it allows insertion of a large (multi-megabyte) arbitrary file in a single transaction. A child porn picture was promptly uploaded to BSV's chain, but everyone pretended not to notice.

Due to general boycott by banks, many crypto exchanges -- led by Bitfinex -- shifted from national currencies to a dollar surrogate called USDT.  It can be moved and traded anonymously like any cryptocurrency, but its issuance and mining is centrally controlled by a company called Tether, created by the same people who own Bitfinex.  Tether claims that each USDT is backed by one USD in their reserves, and hence can be assumed to be worth the same.  They have issued about 4 billion USDT, but have not provided any real proof that they hold any of the corresponding USD.  In fact, they had to admit that they had at most 3/4of that amount.  But it does not matter anyway, since their ToS does not oblige them to redeem USDT for USD. Nevertheless butters keep trusting USDT as if it was worth 1 USD.  Those 4 billion USDT are believed to be responsible for pumping the price of bitcoin to the current 8600 USD/BTC.

""Blockhain technology"" -- using the blockchain structure for non-currency applications, like tracking Walmart lettuce from farm to hospital, became the new computer technology fad for a while, but then faded as fads are fated to do. It will not be missed.

lhord_burning,"PAXFUL ACCOUNT frozen while I was in dispute and I later WON the DISPUTE but it’s still FROZEN

 
Hello Sir / ma, 

I’m a PAXFUL user with name GODSONNATION1, Please I hereby tender my apologies for using another PAXFUL account to TRADE, the PAXFUL account with username QUALITY_BTC is not mine but a friend own, of which I have to make use of the account because of the VENDOR (Bitcoin Seller) with username NINYOLISTIKO who’s trying to RIP me off 5,000 pesos payment I made into his GCash account SUCCESSFULLY of which he claimed it and to my surprise he went far ahead to block me off, so I won’t be able to TRADE with him no more or see his offer which means that way that I lost the whole 5,000 pesos paid to him ...

So I came up with the idea with my friend to assist me with her account so I can apprehend the SCAMMER with username NINYOLISTIKO of which my PLAN later turned out SUCCESSFULLY and I’m so grateful to GOD almighty and team paxful  for the great work done ✅, GOD bless you all abundantly ... 

I’m please pleading for the UNFROZE of the PAXFUL account with username QUALITY_BTC because the SCAMMER had admitted himself to be SCAMMER but he couldn’t confess it out, please kindly help me unfroze my account and please so I can make use of my BITCOIN in time and continue trading cuz I won the DISPUTE by the Bitcoin seller later released the Bitcoin to me cuz he couldn’t provide PROVE the MODERATOR told him to, thanks and GOD bless 🙏 

I did that just to save PAXFUL community and sanitize the whole community, just to be free from SCAMMERS who hinder people’s from making progress in time ..

I will be favorably looking forward to read from the Team in charge, just to hear that my letter is favorably considered and APPEAL ACCEPTED ... 

Thanks and GOD bless PAXFUL, Amen 🙏",ff359mf,2020-01-21 00:26:38,1

oogally,"Just heard this on the radio.  No transcript yet, but the gist is that bank withdrawals are severely limited and it sounds like economy is collapsing due to capital controls.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking forward to the day when a significant portion of the population will keep at least a small portion of their savings in bitcoin.  In my mind, this is the ideal use case and could provide a lifeline for those who just want to buy basic medical supplies or diapers like those in the interview.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's keep our eyes on the prize and work toward providing that lifeline.  In my mind we need volatility to continue dropping (it seems to be happening little by little), continue investing in scaling tech (LN, pegged sidechains, Schnorr, etc.), and UX.  I'm optimistic on all these fronts.

If what you like about cryptocurrency is the privacy angle, Monero (XMR) is by far the most popular privacy coin.

But: they can go bankrupt, get hacked, require new documents from you that you cannot provide etc. so that you can lose access to your bitcoins. (e.g. google Bitfinex or QuadrigaCX Hack)

Wendys_4_Tendies,"So two big things that I thought I would share that I learned from spending time on crypto YouTube and crypto twitter

1. Even in people who are bullish on Ethereum and advocate it, they don’t know about eip 1559 and it’s potential effects on supply. Many reference the lack of a supply cap making it worse as a store of value than bitcoin. 

2. These same people don’t realize that our inflation even without eip 1559 will be lower than bitcoin in a couple of years. 

These are people who are bullish on eth so people who don’t even have eth on their radar are probably completely oblivious. I believe this information asymmetry will lead to people who are heavily investing in eth to become pretty wealthy once these things become common knowledge.",ff75a4x,2020-01-22 06:16:38,2

I can’t stress how true this is. Very perceptive of you for picking up on that. On one hand, it’s kind of frustrating. But on the other, when I understand a Youtuber’s role in all of this (they’re essentially news reporters), although it’s frustrating to see them not up to date or to see them spread misinformation, it only furthers the difference in perceived value vs. actual value. 

And a youtuber’s lack of awareness of what EIP-1559 is and what effect it’ll have doesn’t negate its existence or effect whether it get adopted. It just means that those youtubers are behind on the news that they’re spreading. It’s unfortunate, but it’s also an opportunity that can potentially be very profitable for the people who are aware of that information gap.",ff765f2,2020-01-22 06:24:47,2

cryptorebel,"Craig is Satoshi the one who invented Bitcoin. Dr. Wright already proved it privately to many prominent people that have vouched for him based on cryptographic as well as social evidence.  For example [Ian Grigg](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6lfz1o/ian_grigg_says_craig_wright_and_dave_kleiman_was/), [Gavin Andresen](http://gavinandresen.ninja/satoshi), and [Jon Matonis](https://medium.com/@jonmatonis/how-i-met-satoshi-96e85727dc5a), among others. Many haters and cult members don't like it, and don't want to accept that evidence and I guess they claim it was some elaborate magic trick hoax. 

The [Tulip Trust](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2644014-Tulip-Trust-Redacted.html) is some mysterious trust Dr. Wright was using to hold millions of Bitcoin. There is an ongoing lawsuit with Dave Kleiman's estate over the coins. Dave helped Dr. Wright creating Bitcoin and they were friends but he died several years ago, and now his brother Ira Kleiman is suing Dr. Wright for a portion of the coins. Dr. Wright has said that Dave is owed some coins, but the amount is in question. When the case is resolved we may see coins move on the blockchain as a result of court order or settlement agreement which would shoot down a lot of the doubters about Dr. Wright being Satoshi. But that is just speculation we really don't know what will happen, just have to wait and see.  But in the end if does not matter who Dr. Wright is, all that matters is BSV is following Satoshi's vision and mining world record blocks and trying to spread sound money to the world. +/u/BitsTipper 0.01 bsv verify",ff77pqp,2020-01-22 06:39:19,2

Phanes7,"I was mostly being sarcastic and making fun of gold bugs, but... 

I think the value of gold standard comes in that it makes it really hard to cheat (other benefits as well but in the modern world this is the main one). Since I can go exchange my currency for gold at any time it is hard to just run the printing press. 

With that said, I agree with you that in the age of the blockchain this may be outdated. If we accept that Cryptocurrency is essentially impossible to counterfeit then we don't need the gold standard qua gold standard any more. 

Honestly I think something like bitcoin, which isn't tied to any numbers that can be manipulated but is tied to the functioning of a ""payment system"" is probably how that should run. 

It is infinitely divisible so it can continue to function under deflation. The only question being if a currency can actually function under a set amount (like Rothbard claimed) or if we do need some system to grow the money supply over time.",ff9djn8,2020-01-23 01:30:57,1

ShadowOfHarbringer,"&gt; Understanding the Game Theory and trust aspects of the initiative, Séchet asked control of the Infrastructure Funding Plan for Bitcoin Cash key be placed “in the hands of people who have proven they work in the best interest of Bitcoin Cash, even during rough times, have a commitment to infrastructure and a proven track record, such as Jonald Fyookball, Mengerian and myself. This would effectively give 2 people in this group a veto power over spending, and, obviously, miners would also have veto power as they can decide to discontinue the plan,” also naming “a group of trusted community members, such as Vin Armani, Josh Ellithorpe, Chris Pacia or Mike Malley [(co-founder of CoinSpice)] who can advise on ways to spend the funds, as well as blow the whistle in case something fishy is going on. A group of 7 to 12 miners, developers, and businessmen in total would ensure that various sides of the ecosystem have their say without bogging down the whole thing with unnecessary bureaucracy,” Amaury Séchet urged.

cryptonaut420,"Seems like a dumb idea and unnecessary. Development has never stopped and it seems to still be continuing forward without any of this. Bitcoin itself was developed without millions in funding (as far as we know). The system already works pretty well with decent scaling that isn't even close to being utilized. Sure there are always more improvements and optimizations to work on. But $6 million worth? I don't know man. How many extra developers are going to be hired with that? Or are the existing teams just lining their own pockets big time, while doing mostly the same shit they were already doing anyway? Not to mention the questions of control and who decides how the money is spent and to who. Being a developer working on a project for a long time doesn't mean you are automatically qualified to manage funds responsibly either.

todu,"&gt; The miners have set up this proposal in this way is because of the tragedy of commons. If there is no coercion to pay the fee, nobody will pay it.

The miners obviously want to spend 6 million USD on BCH infrastructure. But they couldn't resist the temptation to simultaneously do an unacceptable power grab that will destroy BCH in the medium to long term. Human greed has destroyed the Bitcoin invention and its currency variants. You people just don't see it yet. 

The Bitcoin invention is eleven years old now and what has the Bitcoin community accomplished? Constant political conflicts and short sighted greedy egotistical disagreements, hostile takeovers and power grabs, stagnating user adoption and market cap growth to irrelevantly small sizes. The central bankers must be observing us and laughing their asses off. They don't need to destroy us when we keep destroying ourselves. 

I really should stop commenting now because what's the point. It's a bad and futile habit to try to correct people on the internet who will never change their opinions anyway. Your personal greed is blinding you people from the big picture and how great things could be for us all if people would be just slightly less greedy and short term egotistical. 

I understand Mike Hearn's frustration and rage quitting much better now. He missed a bit of profits but seems to have been fundamentally correct: People are simply too stupid for the Bitcoin invention to work and replace fiat currencies, so Bitcoin (and its variants) is essentially a failed currency.",ffdcer8,2020-01-24 07:18:29,2

px403,"Gavin has always acted in the best interests of the community, and humanity as a whole. He joined the community by setting up the bitcoin faucet, which gave away 5 BTC to anyone who asked. This move alone introduced a *TON* of early people to the space. Satoshi saw his pure intentions early, and made him in charge of the Bitcoin github, a position that he never abused, though he easily could have. Gavin desperately tried to bring diverse thought to the core development community, which ultimately led bad faith actors into wedging the project, and evicting him when he tried to stop them as diplomatically as he could.

Due to Gavin's statement about Craig, I do actually believe that Craig was the ""idea guy"" behind Bitcoin. For people unfamiliar with the process, the ""idea guy"" is the one who throws a bunch of weird ideas and money at actual developers, and then tries to take all the credit. Craig thinks this contribution has earned him the privilege of calling himself ""Satoshi"", though I disagree.

I think Satoshi was primarily Dave Kleiman, a brilliant cypherpunk who needed money for medical bills towards the end of his life. Craig was the one that ended up paying for Dave's medical bills, likely in exchange for creating Bitcoin and operating the Satoshi identity. The big giveaway IMO is if you notice how desperately Craig has been trying to obtain Dave's personal USB stick from Dave's brother Ira.

Talk about not being able to have a rational conversation. You have a hard time responding to direct answers to your questions. Then you prove you have no understanding of what xrp even is or how Ripple’s tech works. 

Xrp is a currency. Now different than bitcoin. No, I take that back, it is far superior to bitcoin as a currency because it actually can handle network traffic of a currency.

Also, while there is some risk of confiscation or loss when keeping your Bitcoin on an exchange as reputable as Coinbase the odds are pretty low. We're in much more mature days than Mt.Gox.

Sounds to me like you're doing exactly what you should be. Small incremental steps, continued research and asking questions.

ShiraCheshire,"It's good that you bought practical stuff like food instead. Think about it. For every one thing like bitcoin that actually gets big, there's a hundred things like beanie babies that are totally worthless later on. Spending on things that might get big later instead of food and bills is absolutely stupid. The people who do that are the same type that go broke buying piles of lottery tickets that end up all worth nothing. 

If you went around spending on things that might get popular, it wouldn't have paid off. If you managed to get anything out of any of those investments, you'd probably just put them into something else, and that thing would end up crashing on you. Then your biggest regret wouldn't be not spending on bitcoin, it would be spending on bitcoin and then losing it all because you invested in juicero or some other failure.",ffj0etz,2020-01-26 06:20:37,1
WittyStick,"An address is either a hashed public key or a hashed script. Each public key is generated from a distinct private key. (`Q = d x G`), where `Q` is the public key, `d` is the private key and `G` is the generator point of the elliptic curve. `x` here means elliptic curve multiplication.

Each private key `d` is essentially a 256-bit random number. Your wallet needs to store each private key it uses, or be able to regenerate them deterministically. The public keys can always be regenerated from the private key, but they're usually cached by the wallet too.

The deterministic approach for key generation usually follows [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki), where a single *master* private key and chaining key are remembered, and from this, a hierarchy containing any number of other keys can be generated using a deterministic key derivation function.

In terms of linkage. The public keys are usually entirely distinct and cannot be matched up by an observer, but BIP32 supports a form of ""unhardened"" public keys, which allows anybody knowing the public key and chaining key (known as the xpub) for a public key can themselves regenerate all of the unhardened child public keys of that parent. This is designed so that some accounts can be auditable without revealing private keys.

Aside from the actual keys themselves, the usual way that addresses can be linked is when multiple UTXOs are used in a single spend - and an observer can assume they belong to the same person - and also they can usually assume one of the outputs of a transaction are *change* addresses, and use it to probabilistically trace your transaction activity if they're able to link some other keys to your identity. There's no easy way to fix this - but coin mixing techniques can make it difficult for observers to trace your activity if the anonymity set of the mixes are sufficient.",ffj0f4s,2020-01-26 06:20:43,1

Peccataclamantia,"Again we live in a time where there is no objective truth just subjective opinions relative to whatever someone is feeling. If a bunch of neckbeards have the need to pay $10k for a string of prime numbers, then the price is $10k. It's like the stock market, amazon is worth trillions of market cap yet has made a lifetime profit of something like 50 billion? It's all perception nothing else. What is so innovative about a flea market that started off as a Ponzi scheme? Nothing, yet someone subjectively believes it's incredible tech because a professor said so. It's the same in the social sphere where people argue that genders are make belief and 2 men can marry LOL!

Subjective opinions trump objective fact. That is liberalism in a nutshell. Whatever an individual 'feels' to be true, is true. Bitcoin is an application of that to neckbeard land.

Such reorgs are about double spending specific utxos, but if the system was experiencing them regularly, bitcoin could not sustain its value because it would no longer have the properties required of it as a system for reliably representing money.

&gt;The point is that once we start paying for one ""super important thing"" it will turn out that there are many other ""super important things"" that also need funding.  It will not be possible to raise taxes sufficiently high to pay for them all. Deciding which of the super important things are the most important will become a politicized process dominated by opportunists jockeying for position at this new faucet of free money.  

&gt;The bitcoin protocol is very simple and was mostly complete in 2009 (by Satoshi).  It is 11 years later and we should be moving towards a stable protocol (without block size limits) and the role of the ""protocol developer"" should be waning.  Many people are passionate about bitcoin and will continue to do the work that needs doing. And as bitcoin becomes more important to businesses—because we attract more users—these business will also have an incentive to contribute.  But with service fees funding a wage assistance program for select developers, these select developers will block initiatives that come from the volunteer devs or companies, to avoid revealing the uselessness of the assistance program.

- What happens the next time the coffers are empty?

- What happens if these 4 miners decide to dip into this fund to buy more miners? To defend the chain against hostile miners or something. Further enabling them to maintain their 51%.

- The Hong Kong company has zero accountability.

backlogg,"Thank you Peter. You have answered almost all the questions i had about this, and made some great points. Something no other BCH dev did or could. Introducing this as a protocol change makes this whole proposal very disingenuous. Because what miners will do does not matter, everyone who does not adhere to this policy will be forked off the network regardless, no matter the hashpower. This looks more like ABC is flexing the power they have over the protocol, since they are the only ones that can make this happen as a protocol change right now.

I seriously can't believe so many prominent people in the BCH community think this is a good idea. Another chain or community split is not something BCH can afford right now, but it's looking like it might happen yet again. This whole fund is going to cost so much more than it could ever theoretically benefit the progress of BCH. And somehow so many people are blind to the consequences.

Cypherswann,"No worries! I was in your position once, so I'll explain in simple terms :D

&amp;#x200B;

When you own a piece of bitcoin on a website such as 'Coinbase' in theory, you own X amount of BTC - But lets say, your account got frozen, Coinbase went bankrupt, Coinbase locked your account as 'suspicious' or simply your bank account dislikes crypto and locked your transaction to coinbase. All this, resulting your account being locked for X amount of days until support fixes the situation (CB support are horrible). Now, with £100 this aint to bad, but people storing upwards of 10+ Bitcoins are damn right crazy. Now you do not have access to any 'keys' through coinbase, they own them. 

""Not your keys, not your coin"".

Owning a hardware wallet gives you access to the ""Keys"" these are basically a secret piece of data which is used to sign transactions. Your often here the term 'not your keys, not your coin'. Its safe, secure and you have no third party restricting you from using/selling/sending your crypto. 

&amp;#x200B;

Crypto on exchange = Like putting your money in a pot that other people have access too. You know its there, but someone could ultimately freeze/lock/take/steal.

Crypto in hardware wallet = Like putting your money in a safe, meaning its your responsibility to keep it safe and hidden.

FLhelicopterpilot,"Hello, I am a DPE and happened to come across this thread while looking at the other helicopter news for today and figured I would answer a few of the questions and comments.  

While I am a helicopter examiner and do less checkrides than most of the airplane examiners, our experiences with practical tests are similar.

I've extracted some of the basic questions from this post and provided answers, comments, and context.

**Are examiners expected to maintain a certain pass rate?**

No, there is no set percentage that we are expected to maintain.  There have been times when I've had probably around 20-30 applicants in a row pass, and times when I've had 5 or so consecutively fail.  I have never had a FAA inspector contact me regarding either a high, or low, pass rate.

Also, pass rates vary widely by checkride.  Consider a Private Airplane Single Engine Sea (ASES) class add on vs. an initial CFI checkride - the pass rate for the Private ASES add on is significantly higher than for an initial CFI.  An examiner who primarily does ASES add ons would likely have a higher pass rate than one who completes a large number of initial CFIs.



**Why do some DPEs only take cash?**

The implication from other posters is that some examiners are misrepresenting their income for taxes.  It would be extremely easy for the IRS to contact AFS 760 (Airmen Certification) and find out exactly how many 8710 applications we individually processed as examiners in a given year, so it would seem a bit odd to me that any examiner would consider this.

Personally, I accept cash or electronic payment such as Venmo, ApplePay, etc.  Additionally, I will accept a check from a reputable flight school. While it has never happened to me personally, I know several examiners who have had checks cancelled on them - some because the applicant failed and was angry and others because of issues with flight schools. It's not really tax avoidance, it's that cash or electronic payment is the best method to avoid those issues.

While it hasn't happened yet, I keep expecting an applicant to offer payment in Bitcoin at some point. 

**Why didn't my examiner give me a receipt for the checkride?**

I always ask at the end of a certification activity if the applicant would like a receipt, but very rarely does anyone request one. Typically the only people who seem to ask are DoD/DoS, government contractors, or applicants sponsored by a company. If they do, I email them a receipt to the email address provided on their 8710.  

**What do I do if the DPE refuses give me a receipt?**

Again, not something I've heard of from other DPEs in my FSDO, but in case this happens, my suggestion would be to not start the checkride until you receive a receipt if you want one. 

Per the FAA, the checkride has not started until the examiner states that ""The checkride has begun."" Prior to that, the examiner and applicant are reviewing the pretest briefing, and that normally includes the fee structure for the examination, and for any discontinuances or re-examinations.  

If the examiner won't provide you with a receipt and you require one, let them know that you prefer to start the checkride only after you receive one. If for some reason they still refuse to provide you with one, then politely let them know that you would prefer to conduct that practical test with another examiner.

**Why is my DPE charging me XX amount for a checkride, or additional fees for [insert reason]?**

I really can't answer that question as it's very broad, and relates to geographic location, volume of checkrides, etc. I can, however, tell you how I approach re-examinations and discontinuances:

For a *Notice of Disapproval* when I need to come back on another day for a re-examination, my fee is half the original fee. 

For a *Letter of Discontinuance* due to weather or maintenance, I do not charge a fee to come back.  

Travel - The FAA removed the geographic restriction of examinations that was previously limited to the FSDO area. If I receive a request outside the FSDO I'm assigned, I charge travel time per hour, and airfare and/or hotel fees as appropriate. I do not charge for travel for any checkride conducted within my FSDO.

As other posters have mentioned, some examiners charge a retake fee equal to the original full cost, or a fee for weather/maintenance related discontinuances. I suspect this is for high volume examiners, who often have their schedules booked out weeks in advance.  The FAA limits us to the number of practical tests we can complete in a given day, so likely these examiners are having to reschedule their other checkrides, which causes a cascade effect causing them to reschedule other checkrides, subsequently causing them to lose the full fee they would normally charge for those slots.  

**I have a complaint about a DPE who failed a checkride for my student (or me), what do I do?**

First of all, consider the validity of the complaint.  As another poster mentioned, sometimes the defense mechanisms of applicants involve blaming the examiner for the pilot's own failure on a checkride.  

Any Notice of Disapproval must be as result of a deficiency in an Area of Operation and Task in the ACS or PTS. The examiner normally will explain the reasons for the unsatisfactory grade and why it did not conform to the ACS/PTS.

In the event the DPE did fail the applicant on something you believe inappropriate, for example, using ACS/PTS Commercial pilot standards despite it being a Private checkride, I would suggest contacting your FSDO and explaining the situation, with as much detail as possible.  

**I can't find an examiner, or the local examiner is scheduled out weeks in advance.**

Unfortunately this has been a problem, which the FAA has been addressing.  One thing the FAA has done to help was to remove the geographic restrictions that were previously placed on us that limited us to our FSDO's borders.  Now, as examiners, we are able to conduct airmen certification anywhere in the U.S.  

If you are having trouble finding an examiner, I would suggest calling DPEs in neighboring areas/FSDOs to see if they can assist.  

Additionally, the FAA is designating more examiners in high volume activity areas.  However, this process does take some time, as selected examiners must undertake classes and FAA indoc into the examiner system.  As a point of reference, it took me approximately four months to complete final approval as an examiner. Recently, I heard that my FSDO had an additional 3-4 pilot examiners selected and completing the process, so the FAA is trying to alleviate checkrides delays in certain areas, but it is not an overnight fix.

ErdoganTalk,"So BCH has that too, 

BCH is money, it is cash, it is sound. It says all. There is only holding over time, and there is transfer of ownership, which is only momental.

Since it is so good, many people will want to have a balance, so in the period of introduction and adoption, which will last for some years, it is also an opportunity to win some more than normal. This is not detrimental to the system, as far as I can see, it works perfectly as day to day money too. The value change does not matter much, one day you pay 0.02 for a beer, another day you pay 0.008, so what. The wallets are very hellpful in figuring out what to pay, while the prices currently are apparently measured in AUD. But they aren't really, it is something else, what the vendor thinks he can get, and it varies by the day.

With Bitcoin BTC, it is the same, but the futute fees will make small outputs unspendable, so a few hundred dollars is currently a practical minimum. Note that the fee is per output, what you receive into your wallet. So if you buy for 500, then 500, each time moving it to your personal wallet, you will have two outputs, even if you withdraw to the same address, and you will need slightly less than two standard fees to move it in one transaction. You can keep the BTC on the exchange, and let them handle it, but then there is the counterparty risk, which is real.

With BCH you don't even have to think about the fees, they are so small you can ignore them,  and they will stay small.",ffqoeid,2020-01-28 00:44:22,1

jonas_h,"As a software developer I of course agree with everything on how development works.

&gt; Combine this with a very low burn rate and this creates an incentive to oppose and try to block attempts to fund other development teams as they would be lone group remaining if everyone else packed up and left. 

While it's true this dynamic can exist, I think you're being unfair here. I'd like to think they want to block the cartel proposal because they, as do I, see it as incompatible with a decentralized network such as BCH should be. Bitcoin Verde, who aren't exactly swimming in funds, thinks the same.

&gt; But it's pretty clear that Satoshi didn't have a similar plan for financing development during the bootstrap phase.

I always assumed he wanted the project to live on in the spirit of open source, like how it's being done right now.

&gt; But the general opposition, if not outright hostility, to developer financing seems very misguided to me. 

The hostility isn't against developer financing, in fact quite the opposite as people everywhere are now pledging more donations and we're all here discussing how to better finance developers aren't we? The hostility is focused on a central party handling the donations and that miners are forced to ""donate"".

&gt; Show me an alternative financing proposal that has an equally realistic chance of success and I'll seriously consider it. 

Monero's [Community Crowdfunding System](https://ccs.getmonero.org/) has been extremely successful, and there are for example several researchers who've been paid full-time. (Which is something very needed, in addition to developers.)

The strength of such a system is that anyone can get funding, not just a few selected developers, for other things outside of full node implementations. For example wallets, payment gateways and even marketing are also very important.",ffud3d4,2020-01-29 04:23:50,19

Lowpoint was blaming BU using this language:

Wow, just accusation without any proof or frankly even reason. Feels like its just kicking the dog because you feel bad.

And I am sad about this one too;

&gt; Imagine if Satoshi released Bitcoin without a miner subsidy.

Calling the block-reward a subsidy is a perverse twisting of logic. The blockreward is pay for work done. The work needs to be done (Bitcoin would fail without mining) and people don't work for free. That is not a subsidy. We call that pay. Wages. Or, in simple English: a reward for work done. A subsidy ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy)) is a social measure, created by government.

Using this weird view of block-rewards he goes on to conclude that:

&gt; Using part of the miner reward to finance development while the network is bootstapping seems like a reasonable extension of the original concept.

Vendor_BBMC,"Apollon appear to be attempting a type of exit scam which is actually very risky because it opens them up to MLDs (""Malicious Late Deposits"") aka minting, 666ing, golden bitcoin attack. The wallets are like one-way valves, but while everybody has been trying to make withdrawals I've been making small deposits like this one  https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/334WoTxteQQfXGtXCesc2dB2E9o5KNF8FG I'll do a post listing them when the scam ends and the site is taken down, so you can watch the btc moving in real time. _Bon apetite!_

That deposit (and a few others) are like booby traps with a tracking device. They _can't_ be stolen safely. This is called a ""golden bitcoin attack"", it was developed in 2013. Sometime in the future (probably Friday) the site will go dark and all of the wallets will be swept out - including that one. But from monday to thursday, the site will inflate like a balloon as hapless customers pump bitcoin in, but only _one_ person can take it out. 

When that 0.0005446 shown above eventually moves on the blockchain we _know_ it can't be a vendor withdrawal, it can only be the thief. He can tumble it, do what he likes, a reverse taint analysis to find the highest ""connection count"" will always  find it. This short video gives an easy-to-understand visual demonstration of ""minting""  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1QNTumAPeY&amp;has_verified=1

Apollo or an admin only needs to fuck-up once (or more accurately once more)

Usually at this stage of an exit scam, a disgusted admin or moderator from the market comes onto reddit to complain about the owner, but the admins are clearly involved in this, pretending to be vendors while the real vendors are locked out of their shops.

Most darknet customers don't visit reddit or dread. We got really early notification this time (thanks to vendors adopting WIKR) but most people are blissfully unaware that anything is wrong. Apollon will try to keep it looking normal and running for as long as they dare.

You won't get your bitcoin back, but you have the consolation of knowing that apollon fucked up and will never get to enjoy your money. This is probably u/Apollo 's / u/Atlas ' last exit scam, we need to make it a deterrent or future markets might be tempted to try an ""agravated exit scam"" like this.",ffvbvm1,2020-01-29 10:14:30,10

Bear market's bring out the our darkest expectations, but it's worth remembering the sustained and shocking outcomes of bull markets, too.

If the market has flipped we can see sustained CDPR over 0.75. Admiral /u/nannal may not get his nannaling, but he'll own his ship shipping shipping ships soon enough.

Bull markets can absolutely fuck a motherfucker up. If cash is entering the market leverage will over extend itself and bears will be steamrolled and liquidated over and over. All bulls need to do is buy the dip and push through resistance. That can happen over and over to the dismay of seemingly rational market participants.

mildly_asking,"""Yes but no"".

Yes: It's simpler than developing new words. Which is a neat poetic goal, but actually very hard to pull off. New ,widely used, words or phrases are very rare, unless they're from highly sucessful media (supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, In a galaxy far far away) or current cultural trends/events or such (Bitcoin, Yeet).

It is not simplifying already present language. ""Brothermurder"" instead of ""Murder of own brother""isn't much different. There may actually be a lot of creativity involved with sticking words together. Combining established words in unusual ways n stuff. Arno Schmidt, a German literary author, wrote of a ""fuchsrotes Lächelloch"" (FoxRed LaughingHole), also known as a ""geschminkter Mund"" (Mouth with Make-up) or something like that . This is pretty striking, you know the words, but both the unusual combination of words and the unusual naming of already known stuff (Mouth=&gt;laughing-hole) gives the inclined reader a literary 'bruh'-moment without the bother of introducing totally new words.

Zcash uses zk-SNARKs, which provide pretty good anonymity with really small proofs. But ZEC has 2 critical flaws. 



First, privacy is opt-in. Z-addresses are private, but t-addresses are totally transparent. Most exchanges only bother to support t-addresses. z to z transactions are rock solid, but t to z or z to t leaks data about the shielded pool. 



This problem is not wholly intractable; Zcash just needs to hard fork to make the use of z-addresses mandatory.  In fact, there is a coin called Pirate (ARRR) that does just that.



The second, bigger issue is the trusted setup. Zcash has what is called ""toxic waste"" that one must trust has been destroyed; otherwise unlimited coins could be created in the shielded pool. 



Monero's main advantages are that privacy is on by default, and that the code is trustless. 



There are other unique things too. For example, the algorithm is CPU-minable and there is a tail emission to promote long term security and egalitarian coin distribution.",fg1be2n,2020-01-31 07:42:31,4
joeknowswhoiam,"&gt; Bitcoin cash cleared the back log in one 2.3mb block, something Bitcoin could never do as is limited to 1mb blocks or 1.4mb with seqwit.

Why would you lie about something [so easily verifiable](https://i.imgur.com/c9hu0yo.png), those are ~2.3MB blocks on Bitcoin.

Even if there was a 1.4MB limit (which there is not as demonstrated in this link), that's two blocks. 20 minutes on average on Bitcoin... not 5.5 hours.

When was the last time there were 5.5 hours between two Bitcoin blocks?

&gt; And also with 0-confg Bitcoin cash allows payments to still continue, another thing Bitcoin doesn't have.

BCH doesn't *have* 0-conf, it's not a feature, it is the state of a transaction with ZERO CONFIRMATION (i.e. no Proof-of-Work behind it). If you intend your users to trust this, and use this mechanism as the base of most of the retail commerce which require instant deliveries (coffee, groceries, certain services, etc.), of course you can pretend waiting 5.5 hourse for ONE measly confirmation is not big deal... you're already in the business of trust anyways...they can trust that it will eventually happen. So much for respecting Satoshi's conclusions in the whitepaper ""We have proposed a system for electronic transactions **without relying on trust**."". 

&gt; because lightning has failed to be simple enough and easy enough for average users.

That's your opinion and it's demonstrably wrong. [Thousands of nodes are interconnected and have capacity on LN](https://1ml.com/). Annecdotally I use it on a regular basis in an instantaneous and trustless way... two things 0-conf will always be incapable to achieve together. On LN the contract for my channels have confirmations (Proof-of-Work) behind them, it is immutable. Your 0-conf transaction can be replaced at any time.

Go ahead, install a decent LN wallet (Eclair, Phoenix, Lightning App, etc... [here's a nice list with many flavors, custodial to completely trustless](https://veriphi.io/en/blog/lightning-wallet-analysis)). It's generally as easy as sending bitcoins to it and opening a channel (for the ones that don't do it automatically for you). You must be stuck almost 2 years ago, when the first alpha wallets were released if you think any of this ""failed"".

bitvote,"thx for this. 

never been in a bear though? Hmm... in one way I get it. I think.

Bitcoin has always had a huge group of holders who are so far in the money that the recent drop - even 80-90% drops - don't matter much. 

For me, the 2018-19 price action wasn't a huge deal. I'd already taken 15x of what I put in off the table. And was also able to hold onto more than 80% of my btc and that portion was always hugely in the money.

So I get that part. 

But it's hard to know how much of the market is represented by 10x+ in the money BTC. I've never seen a good analysis of this. 

For the flip side, the 2014-2015 bear market felt very, very real. I worked at two major bitcoin/crypto companies. And there were periods of existential concern. 

There was confidence too. but there was a shadow of the bear during those years. We were getting pilloried - by almost everyone. And this wasn't just about standard risks from the speculative market, but massive regulatory risk that can be hard to wrap your head around today...  

And the mood in the daily was just ... different. 

If you're interested in doing a bit of archaeology, it might be fun to poke around the Jan/Feb 2015 daily threads. 

Anyway, on the whole I'd say we've lived through real bear markets. Full stop. 

I think the rest of your post is on point. This thing could so easily go back to $7k. In fact, I'd be a bit surprised if it didn't.

I'd also be surprised if we don't see a new ATH by end of 2021.

notmyrralname,"FRESH MEAT!!!! Bring out your shill bags!!!

So, in one comment you’ve hit all the buttons that is sure to inflame r/cryptocurrency. 

Because, unfortunately, r/cc has descended into a pitifully hopeless realm of bitcoin and anti-corporate’s, completely void of rational and unbiased discourse. 

If a project is not proof of work or can’t be mined on the rig they’ve spent thousands on...”its a shit coin!!!” Will be the answer to ANY of your questions. 

If you ask about a company that seems to be gaining in power and popularity (even ones that are representations of real world adoption of crypto)...”its centralized and shit!”

If the crypto project looks like it helps or supports an established system, be it governmental or financial...”fuck banks and your coin is shit!!!”

And then of course there is coinbase. Though it is unarguably among the top 3 easiest to use on ramps for crypto...”they charge a lot. So fuck them!!!!”

You’ll never get anything like a level answer from anyone in here. Just two fucking extremes of idiocy. 

Having said that. I’ve been using Coinbase since early 2017. No problems at all. Start there. Once you get your feet a little wet advance from there. Don’t take anything that anyone on here says as truth. Not even me. Do your own research. And I DO NOT mean watch YouTube videos or search twitter.

Understand that anyone telling you “buy this coin” or “buy that coin”. The reason why is because they have a shit ton of that one. And THEY want it to go up in value.

Ignore them. 

Research projects that seem like they are working to solve an actual problem. Not like “our crypto currency is going to solve world hunger and eradicate cancer”. Those are the epitome of shit. If they can’t communicate a real problem that exists today then they are smoke and mirrors. 

Once you’ve looked at the problem, look at the solution. If the project is supposed to be a world currency, find out if it actually is functional as a world currency. Does the network (as it is) hold up to thousands of transactions per second. If no? Then it’s not a solution is it?

TL;DR believe none of what anyone in here tells you and you are on an ok track to start with regard to your first choice coins*

In reality, Nano has enough devoted supporters and followers that it isn't going to disappear or go to zero. Understand what this currency represents. It is the first instant, feeless, scalable, ecologically friendly, and decentralized currency in the world. People can now send value *anywhere*, *whenever* they want for free. Nano is the only coin that has all of these features.

You really think people 20 years from now are going to want to pay exorbitant fees and wait 30+ minutes for confirmations? No way. People two years ago didn't want to deal with that.

fixedelineation,"This a huge misunderstanding of how EOS works. If one block producers validates a transaction it becomes part of the chain. It can’t be removed. There is a possibility of black listing, though that possibility exists with bitcoin and many other coins as well.  We saw the attempted blacklisting of transactions fail on EOS because a BP was asleep at the wheel. For some reason It was a bigger scandal than the successful freezing of stolen funds a few months earlier. 

That’s all ancient history though as that aspect of EOS is gone now. There is no evidence of censorship or indication that the chain can be stopped. If you have some I’d like to see.

The huge advantage EOS has and why discussions.app can thrive on the platform is that users can access the EOS chain without having to own any crypto. The transactions are covered by The Novusphere, who can afford to do so only because individual transactions only have a temporary cost.",fg3jfyg,2020-02-01 00:03:07,1

forestball19,"Using my Sir Whitehall identity, I had no difficulty using my hypnotic powers to rob banks - which in this modern day and era, translated to making a poor employee transfer money to Bitcoin, then transferring those digital to an exchange, trade it for one of the anonymity coins and the transfer the whole lot to one of my private wallets. 

In fact, all went well for a few weeks - until the day I met her. I was visiting the North Capitol Bank and enjoying a rather tasty beverage while my victim did the money transferring, when a young girl clad in a pink and white costume waltzed in, singing “these boots are made for walking”. As soon as I saw she wore a mask, I knew she was one of those annoying heroes I’d done such a great job at avoiding. Until now. 

Without flinching or showing any sign that I’d seen her, I threw my mental probe at her, whispering: “Hear my voice, heed my bidding.”

The girl immediately stopped singing and moving. “Yes, Master. Oh sorry - I mean, Yes, Daddy. Do you like it when I call you that?” She began moving again as I could no longer pretend to ignore her. This was impossible. My hypno powers worked on anything with a brain - even animals fell sway under my voice. 

I cleared my throat and in a loud voice commanded: “Freeze!”

- “Do you? Should I come warm you, daddy?” she answered, obviously unaffected and in a voice that made me blush, wishing I wore a mask. 

- “Will you stop calling me ‘Daddy’, at once!” I snapped while getting up and ready to escape. With a few soft spoken whispers, I made three bank employees attack her while I ran for it, my escape line being: “And for the record, I am not that old!”

I saw the girl dodge a chair that was thrown at her, then heard her merry voice answer me: “Yeah whatever. Boomer.”

———

Over the course of the next few months, she increasingly crossed my path and thwarted my plans. Always taunting me and saying very improper things - and I learned that she carried two katana swords on her back, which she wielded with expertise when the situation called for it. I always managed to get away - but at the same time, she always managed to stop me from getting any money for my trouble. 

———

Today it will be different. I have set a trap, and although it will not result in her demise, it will show her that I am not to be taken lightly. 

I already hear her approaching. Today’s song is “I Like Big Butts”. I smirk while slowly picking the spoon from my afternoon tea. The small local bank I have chosen for this scene to play out seems mostly empty. It is not, of course, but only I know that. 

- “Oh hey, Big Daddy! Fancy running into you here, wanna see what I have learned?” she greets me. 

- “As I have bothered to learn your name, Miss Poole, it would only be fitting that you learn mine. Sir Whitehall. And actually, I have been expecting yo-“

- Ugh okay, yeah - Sir White balls, then. Anyway, I watched a video on a website with a lot of pop ups and lemme tell ya, the girls in those videos were fricking agile! And holy shit could they do stuff on a pole that would castrate a grown man, if you know what I mean!” While talking, she dances to one of the counters and jumps up on it with what the young nowadays refer to as ‘swag’.

- “I do, in fact, not know what you mean. Nor do I intend to find out,” I answer calmly, while whispering words of command. 

Five bank employees run at her with ropes. Two customers draw their guns and point them at her. I take a sip of my tea, which tastes quite excellent.

Miss Poole reacts almost casually - first doing a backwards somersault while drawing the gun at her hips, and as she lands she shoots the customers with guns before I can react. Apparently, her gun shoots tranquilizer darts. They fall quickly, sleeping before they hit the floor. Then she moves like water, avoiding the bank employee’s attempts at catching her with their ropes, and somehow she manages to steal the rope from one of them, and as I watch in awe, my tea suddenly tasting bitter, she catches all five of them and binds them up. 

- “Aaaand where was I?” she says with a cheer while walking towards me. “Oh yeah. Subtle or not so subtle hints at adult stuff. But that idiot writer is getting close to the 1,000 characters limit, so I don’t have much time for sass,” she sighs. 

Writer? Character limit?

- “Oh and my big reveal here would be that I’m actually Gwe-... nah, you ruined it. Hadda go call me Miss Poole, even in your thoughts. The fanboys definitely know who I am by now. You coulda called me Pinky or Dildo, but no, you had to ruin the surprise the surprise ending. Even ForestBall is annoyed by that.”

- “Uhm... ah, what?” I manage to stutter. 

She reaches for her mask and takes it off. Shoulder long blonde hair, dyed pink at the tips. Piercing blue eyes and a pretty face full off adolescent ‘I don’t give a shit’ attitude.

- “So, Big Daddy. The story’s over now. How ‘bout we just say ‘dick’ and go grab a beer, huh?”

Confused, my brain just surrendering, I answer dryly: “Yes. Why not.”

- “Come on, big daddy. Say it.” 

I sigh and as I get up, say: “Dick”.",fg3jqb7,2020-02-01 00:06:25,1

Was it really worth the cost? - Trace Mayer",fg3n35n,2020-02-01 00:42:53,1

arBettor,"Yeah, it may not have an immediate effect. But aside from the halving of new supply, hype could definitely pick up as articles are written about the halvening and could lead to a self-fulfilling rally. Many people, including institutional investors, are paying more attention to bitcoin now and are looking to allocate for the long-term. They're likely to buy on any weakness, and to attempt to front-run potential hype.

And I think the author's analysis of the 2016 halving's effect on prices is too narrow. Sure, there wasn't an immediate bump after the halving, but that's because there was a roughly 80% rally the previous month. If I have to suffer through an 80% rally in April, only to see a retracement in May that makes higher lows, I won't consider the halvening a bust.",fg3zzvq,2020-02-01 02:54:41,1
ISkiAtAlta,"Hello Roger.  I really respect your ability to rise above tribalism, especially considering your prominent position in Bitcoin Cash. 

Tao mentioned that Bitcoin Cash is not digital cash.  Even as someone far more involved in Dash, I disagree.  Bitcoin Cash *is* digital cash, it has way more developers, a larger community, and many other advantages over Dash. 

That said, I’m genuinely concerned about Bitcoin Cash’s funding and governance. I would really appreciate if you’d take a look at my post about why I’m grateful for Dash, which expounds on why I’m worried about Bitcoin Cash. 

I want both projects to succeed.  I would love to see your response to my post (either here or on r/dashpay).",fg40696,2020-02-01 02:56:27,1

seemetouchme,"This is the only sub on Reddit where people from /r/bitcoin and all different forms can actually engage with each other.

Where else can you go and actually read arguments/debates from both sides ?  Its funny how emotional people get over a downvote, no wonder why Facebook doesn't have a dislike button.

You will see no technical debates on /r/bitcoin and you won't see all the possible information there.

Just follow nullc account and other bitcoiners and you will notice the only time you get to learn anything is when they post here.

Yes it's mainly focused on bitcoin cash supporters (who are by the way bitcoin supporters, just read the whitepaper ) but that is because they have been banned from participating in /r/bitcoin.

Unfortunately the people who believe bitcoin cash to be a scam come in here only for self amusement and not to actually add in discussion.  Now this is of course not 100% of people, but when people invest their money into something they will have natural instinct to attack anything they fear might bring their value down.

The main differences between the two camps in my opinion is /r/bitcoin wants to increase their wealth via investing in a ticker symbol and /r/btc people want to build a protocol where even a man in Asia makes $2 a day can participate in the network.

So decide why you are actually in bitcoin,",fg40wrd,2020-02-01 03:03:52,1

**Custom Video Rates.**

Starting at..

Price may be influenced by content and length.

**Other Important Info:**

\- I charge 5$ extra for outfit requests. I also charge an additional 5$ PER any alterations to makeup or hairstyle or shoes.

Currently I usually start shows in just a low cut tank top/Tshirt and

panties or lingerie or i cycle through different types of lingere each day. If you want a little more, I offer

lots of different lingerie, sports wear, or normal clothes and shoes. But im always wearing something sexy.

\- I also Charge a 5$ increase per 10 mins on group shows as they require more organization and prep on my end.

\- I do not start my shows naked.

\- I have a standing rule that I call 'Three Strikes, you are out' Which means, I do not keep clients on my list

who pry, or make repeated contact but no payment, time wasters or rudeness. I understand things happen and

sometimes arrangements don't work out.. But i also think three chances is plenty. If after three chances you

find yourself unable to contact me and are unsure why, In all likeliness you have been blocked. This also applies

to clients who have paid before/have become regulars. The only way to become unblocked is to submit a payment

through my ad, (including your skype ID) and then i will unblock you and contact you for a show to avoid wasted time.

\- I also BLOCK without warning for the following reasons....Calling without payment, Unsolicited pictures,

dishonesty about payment, and asking for free shows, pictures etc. If you find yourself unable to contact

me after having done any of these things, Please follow the steps above in my 'Three Strikes, you are out'

Rule to become unblocked. Although you may earn the privilege to be unblocked, previous offenders are kept

on very short leashes and second time offenders are never forgiven. We are all adults, so act like it.

\- I always show as online on Skype because i am signed in on multiple devices to make reaching me easier.

If you message me I will get back to you as soon as possible. I however, do not always respond, as i may be

in a show or unavailable. The best way to reach me is messaging me immediately when you are ready to pay for

a show. I can't guarantee times and i don't really work on a schedule.

\- If you submit a payment without talking to me first, the show will be given at a time convenient for both

me and the client.

Angry_AGAIN,"&gt;  I assume that runners will prefer to have a SIN
A Sin. Period. Having a Real Sin is problematic since this can backfire. In fact - using a ""real"" sin from the Sinner Handicap is something a Runner should avoid like the Pest. It can be used if a char plays Corp Slave by Day and Runner at Night plot but im not a fan of this.

A Real Sin should only be used if there is absolut no other way around - like international traveling. A Char with a low level Fake Sin could use his Real Sin to pass thru Airport/Suborbital Security Checks. But this is a scenario any ""professional"" should avoid.

How and why a Char uses a SIN is a case to case question. But generell speaking,  as a Runner you dive into the Shadows and leave no trail behind, you change your SIN's like Magazines or Ammo Types. Your Fixers and Contacts dont care about a SIN, you pay them with Certified Credsticks(Bitcoin Wallets/PaysafeCards and so on) 
But you need a SIN to participate in the 6. world - so you buy a Fake one, a low level  SIN with a hacked Wallet is enough to buy shit at a Wedding Machine, get yourself a Taxi or Bus ride.

You are sick of living in a Slum? Rent a better Appartement but this means a better Sin that matches the typical security checks for tenants, now you cant use this ""better"" SIN for Runner Stuff ... or you risk burning a Sin with a Home attached to it... so a new SIN shows up.. and the circle goes on. 

&gt;Or do you use your real SIN in your everyday life to maintain the appearence lf a regular citizen

This is funny, because a Runner is or should be trained to avoid such things. Not only because he avoids to use his SIN everywhere - he switches his ID often and operates outside the System. This leaves some sorts of black holes in his Sin Metadata Trail that identifies him as an irregular citizen. But again, deckers are your friends and higher level SIN's are filled with fake Meta Datas to appear ""Real"" Just Asume you buy not only a Fake Identity - you pay a network to keep your fake Person alive. - Btw i assume this since there is no SIN Level degeneration and it makes sense for higher level SINs.


&gt;and use your fake SIN during runs because they are basically throwaways?
Yes but they are also not so easy to obtain and they are costly, so a ""good"" runner trys to avoid a SIN Burn and this brings him back into the Shadows. Sure with a level 3 Sin - he could by his new LMG in a Store but this would include the risk that this SIN will burn up and so he visits the Crime Mall and pays double the Price for an Illegal Gun without question ask.",fg7bjps,2020-02-02 05:22:32,1

But the fees hit an average of over 10 dollars and then the fees comes down. Core was hoping fees would continue to go up, but they did not. They went down and down and down. Does that not mean that BTC is a lot less valuable then they thought?  If the fees hit the highest point ever at over 10 dollars average ... is that not something that is BAD for BTC ... and not good?  From their own perspective at least .... 

They considered themselves so precious they did not want to share it with the world. Rather they were hoping the world was going to perceive them as even more precious then they consider themselves and buy in to it at any cost! But that did not happen.

ebaley,"&gt; Even with segwit blocks dont average above 1.4mb size. And it obviously wasnt enough because **we've had acute fee crises**, and there are long periods of time where average fees are over $1, which the Bitcoin wiki used to say that Devs dont expect fees to ever exceed $1. Shows what they know.

Have we? The fees were nowhere as bad at 14K last year. By 2040 fees will be essential since almost all the coins will have been mined. Ironically bcash was formed because Bitmain wanted the juicy fees that Segwit would deny them.

&gt;""as hardware and bandwidth become more affordable"".

What the hell difference would that make to the average user? Tell me.

&gt;Why do you think I dont accept it? I've moved on from using bitcoin. What i don't accept is morons pretending that bitcoin hasnt been crippled.

Watch your mouth or I'll block you. Get a credit card. They're quite good. Or a Bitcoin debit card.

&gt;In what universe is that a meaningful statement? Thats like saying the only reason people buy Tesla is because of Ford.

Inane analogy. You know fine well people buy alts because they hope to make returns that early Bitcoin adopters made. Few are buying for tech. A negligible amount would be enough for testing.

&gt;Paypal uses a centralized ledger denominated in whatever fiat currency you want. They dont have to have their own unique currency to offer electronic cash.

So YOUR definition of cash is anything that specialises in payments. That's not either of the dictionary definitions.

&gt;Hashrate and liquidity are both only functions of the current level of adoption, and have absolutely nothing to do with the merits of its technical or economic design.

Trust in a money is important. You could declare silver the new gold tomorrow but good luck getting people to join you.

&gt;So its a natural ponzi without a middleman. So what?

You post shit like this again and we drop it. It is the best SoV and safe haven with no central party in existence. Name a better one or GTF. 

&gt;""The original Bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi mentions “transaction” 69 times, “cash” or “payment” 18 times, “gold” 2 times, and “store of value” 0 times. 🤔🤔🤭
https://www.np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ewy1o2/the_original_bitcoin_whitepaper_by_satoshi/

I don't give a shit what he supposedly said. Nobody will use a money that cannot keep value.

&gt;Its literally the first sentence of the whitepaper that outline's bitcoin's design. What better evidence can there be of bitcoin's original intentions and goals?

The genesis block. Nothing about payments. It was central banks he was worried about. Not about buying his groceries. I doubt he had trouble doing that.

&gt;Any crippling of BCH would be only due to loss of marketshare vs before the split with BTC. If BCH retained the BTC ticker and the 99% of crypto users who just defaulted to stay with BTC with no actual thought, bitcoin would still be electronic cash instead of being crippled and relegated to a lowly ponzi scheme.

Btrash however and now it is just another altcoin. And call Bitcoin a ponzi again and I won't respond. Spectacularly stupid.  Criticize it technically if you wish but monetarily it is fantastic.

&gt;But any value was subtracted from the post fork BTC that corresponded to the BCH.

What difference does that make? Why should bcash be worth more than a dollar?


&gt;It wasnt free because you had to have bought or mined BTC to get it.

Please. Who was buying it at these prices if most got it for nothing or no effort?

chernobyl169,"&gt;  the miner did nothing suring segwit2x

Precisely. They did nothing when faced with community outcry, and went along with whatever Bitcoin Core and Blockstream said to do. Here we are again, and in a much more precarious position: on a minority fork.

&gt; If the miners had balls in 2017 we would be in a much better position.

They didn't, and they don't today. Majority hashpower is mining BTC, not BCH. The only thing keeping BCH alive is opportunity cost - it is more profitable to honestly mine BTC than it is to attack BCH, for now. The halvenings this year very likely could shift that balance, and relying on a miner cartel to protect your finances is probably a worse decision than relying on a government cartel to do it.

The bottom line is, the *announcement of intent* undermines the coin itself. Whether the dev tax happens or not is now totally irrelevant; Jihan played his hand and said ""if you don't like it, leave, you can't stop us"". The last time we heard ""if you don't like it leave"" from miners, we did and BCH was born...",fgatl9l,2020-02-02 23:55:54,1
swgellis,"Decentralized currency based on math. The network is run by tens of thousands of computers and miners all over the globe. If Asia and Africa disappeared tomorrow the network would still be running. No one person controls the network. Through the power of cryptography every transaction on the network is verified and then permanently placed onto the bitcoin blockchain, which is about 280 gigabytes of data at this point. In this way bitcoin transactions are immutable. Nobody can fake them and nobody can modify the chain. If you try to modify the chain, the rest of the worldwide network rejects your change because it’s inconsistent with their chain files. Long story short, decentralized currency that can’t be controlled by anyone. Oh, and did I mention it has a hard cap of 21 million coins? There are more than 21 million millionaires on earth, but there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. It can’t be counterfeited and it can’t be faked.

Bitcoin CME futures have proven somewhat popular, and provide institutional money a way to gain exposure to BTC price-volatility. But it will be super interesting to see the introduction of ETH futures into an early stage bull market, especially if ETH sets a precedent early in the cycle as being the ""higher alpha"" pick for crypto.

Compare and contrast this with when BTC futures were introduced at a the top of the market. Yes, BTC futures were possibly used to help get the market ""under control"" during the bull top.

But what happens if if ETH futures launch before a true crypto-wide speculative mania has taken hold?

Eth going back to $1000 for one which isn't quite its all time high and the entire crypto marketcap returning to the late 2017 800 billion range.

BTC is digital gold and purely a store of value. Nothing else really. ETH and smart contracts is why 2017 happened in the first place. ICOs is what brought all the money in. BTC was all  speculation mania and people cashing out their scam, shit coin etc.. profits for something reliable and trustworthy.

I feel people are quite naive right now and seem unaware while its important to see BTC succeed and go up in value.

Time: 00:30 GMT

POTD: **Brooklyn Nets ML** @ 1.79 / -127

Nets have recently turned things around after a string of sub-par performances, they've now won 3 of their last 5 games and are on a 2-game winning streak at the Barclays Center. The continuance of this resurgence is vital for Brooklyn's playoff ambitions as they look to safeguard their 7th position in the Eastern Conference.

Unfortunately Kyrie is out again for at least a week with a sprained medial ligament in his right knee - an injury he picked up against the Wizards on Saturday. He averages 27.4 points for the season and had just dropped a season high of 54 points against the Bulls the night before picking up that injury. Brooklyn have a horde of gifted players to fall back on though and the team's performance rarely suffers from the absence of their star pointguard. One of those talents is Spencer Dinwiddie who averages 21.5 points, 3.3 rebounds and 6.5 assists per game. 

The Suns have even bigger injury problems of their own. Their star pointguard Ricky Rubio is currently nursing an ankle injury as he was ruled out against the Bucks on Sunday in a game they lost by 21 points. Another pointguard Ty Jerome also didn't play as he was suffering from left calf soreness. Power forward Dario Saric is suffering from an ankle injury while influentual big men Aron Baynes and Frank Kaminsky also remain sidelined, with hip and knee injuries respectively.

Im not sure if Satoshi specified a fee level, but its hard to believe he'd consider fees several orders of magnitude higher than originally ""low"". I do know that the Bitcoin wiki for years in the fee section stated ""Fees are not expected to ever exceed $1"".

WeakHands_Trader,Miners mine bitcoin with a hardware unit called a asic miner. These can cost thousand of dollars and you spend a lot on electricity bills.  proof of stake is when you mine without any need of hardware or electricity Bill's. You're able to mine based off locking up a portion of your coins and that's it. So you are staking your share in the network to secure it.

nodecache,"[Hopefully you don't mind my replying to you instead of them.] (https://old.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/euf571/charlie_lee_proposes_voluntary_mining_reward/ffp5p5q/)

&gt; Not gonna feed the trolls by responding directly to them, but for passersby checking in, Charlie is one of the good guys. For starters, litecoin was fairly launched. He bought his own coins, mined them same as everyone else. Litecoin didn't have an ICO or a premine. It's no one's business what Charlie did with his own friggin coins any more than what you do with yours.  
&gt; 
&gt; Second, he not only disclosed what he did, despite not needing to, he also warned others that based on his experiences, the market would eventually consolidate and a multiyear bear market was possible, he did this when other real scammy founders were hyping and pumping and dumping. Now the acolytes of those real loser scumbags come here to try and discredit Charlie by accusing him of the exact opposite of what he did.  
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, Charlie has more skin in the game than anyone. He was never as invested as people imagine founders to be (because they're used to ICOs and premines that put massive percentages in founder's pockets at the outset), but his investment is his time and energy. No altcoin has achieved as much infrastructure as Litecoin has with so few resources, and that's mostly due to Charlie. Not trying to downplay the actions of the community, other LTCF employees, volunteers and supporters, but I've seen communities and individuals as dedicated and invested as our strongest members fail to get even basic infrastructure after years of concerted effort for their favorite coin while Litecoin secures the biggest exchanges and other infrastructure almost from day 1. I can't imagine anyone who's really a part of this community even taking umbrage at the idea that Charlie's role at getting the coin so well supported is massively outsized.  
&gt; 
&gt; Other coins are jealous of our success, particularly on infrastructure. Some of the accusers were probably fooled themselves, some are actively trying to undermine Litecoin, often by accusing litecoin of doing what their coin actually does. In all cases, you have to do your own research. Don't rely on what I'm saying, check the history. I won't hold your hand through all of it, but here's Charlie letting people know in early december 2017, before the market topped off, that hard times were coming: https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/940357341723082752  
&gt; 
&gt; That's a standup guy, and one with a lot of perspective and wisdom. You can choose to listen to him or to listen to the trolls. Beware, you may well start to resemble whomever you listen to. If you listen to the trolls, check the mirror daily for signs of mouth foaming and seek medical help as necessary. If you listen to Charlie, you might start to understand the world of crypto better, and that can be jarring, because outside of a very small number of coins like Litecoin and Bitcoin, there are scams aplenty.",fgfxswd,2020-02-04 02:12:19,1

What if a new leader emerged to buoy the market and hike it into the next phase of legitimacy? What if that leader turns out to be a digital currency developing in the shadow of Bitcoin, going mostly undetected while playing 2nd fiddle to its mainstream counterpart?

What if... you all know the rest.

Lyle_the_Crocodile,"ICE has offered to buy eBay in the past, and was declined. I wouldn't put much stock into this offer unless a large fund ""strongly urges"" them to sell (see the Stubhub sale). But hypothetically, if ICE buys them out, I'd expect the following to happen (Disclaimer - this is all wild conjecture based on what I know of them as a company):

1) eBay's outdated tech stack would be revamped and made more user friendly... that'd be great. I don't know anyone that likes how glitchy and weird eBay's listing functionality gets sometimes. Of course, this would mean we'd likely see more competition. Easier to sell means lower barrier for entry.

2) The seller standards would get a lot stricter. ICE has experience turning less-than-stellar financial securities marketplaces into well oiled machines, and they do that by updating infrastructure and figuring out what's losing the most money. I know that in our bubble we'd all like to believe that buyer scams/returns are the bane of eBay's existence, but it's much more likely that buyer confidence is what's holding back growth. I'd expect them to crack down on sellers and do the best they can to get eBay up to par with the level that people trust Amazon.

3) Lots and lots of marketing. Making the whole world aware that ""new"" eBay is better than ever, and they can finally trust it again. With this, I imagine would come higher fees for us.

4) Extremely advanced payment systems that hopefully abandon Paypal. ICE's bread and butter is financial trading systems. They've got the experience to roll out something awesome for payments. Something that would hopefully be easier for both buyers AND sellers.  They also own ""Bakkt"" which deals with Bitcoin, so we might see some of that as well.

5) ICE is also involved in data services and analytics. We could end up with some pretty sweet market analysis tools to help recognize price patterns on certain goods. This might just be wishful thinking, though.

I knew I'd win with just TSLA alone because I saw about 4 or 5 per day in SoCal, but internet speculators were still going on about Tesla never being able to deliver on Model S orders.

SilverHoard,"One major reason why they went off the gold standard was that they wanted fractional reserve lending, meaning they could generate more money backed by an increasingly small amount of physical assets. That gave those who controlled the money supply power. The gap between physically held assets and the IOU's (dollars) grew wider until they simply didn't have enough to ever pay it back without bankrupting the state, so they left it entirely and even made ownership of gold illegal for a while. It's only after the last financial crisis that gold and silver were once again recognized as legal tender.

Many in the cryptocurrency space like coins like Bitcoin because they are not only not inflationary, but deflationary. There's a limited number minted and many are permanently lost. Governments can't print more at a whim. With stablecoins, it's still pegged to the very assets many want to escape. Which might be what you want, depending on the use case.

It's also decentralized, meaning governments can control exchanges (for now) but not the coin itself. As long as there are miners or stakers or whatever else they come up with, you're free to do whatever you want with it with no third party telling you what you can and cannot do. That's pretty unique in history.

And yes, there's also the investment side of things. Given those very fundamentals and the fact that very few own any and even fewer really know anything about it, let alone how to buy and store any, it's not farfetched that prices might increase. Especially when combined with the inflation rate of fiat currencies.

And there's also a large sort of prepper/hedging side of things. With the massive global debt and negative interest rates and stock market in what looks to be bubble territory, many see it as a potential hedge against a crash or even global collapse.

baltakatei,"&gt; What's the best option?

## Short answer: Whatever the software the certificate authority you trust requires.

## Longer answer:

The short answer takes care of you unless you don't have a trusted certificate authority.

Why might you not need a trusted certificate authority? I'm going to push back with a question: ""Who do you imagine will be verifying what you sign and for what reason?""

1. Is it a client using Microsoft Outlook whom you are trying to impress by differentiating yourself from other bidders via a 🎀 icon appearing whenever they read emails from you?

2. Is it an IT manager in your corporation who wants to mitigate the risk of malicious email tampering?

3. Is it an IT expert hired by your lawyer to defend you in a lawsuit by establishing useful facts for your case?

4. Is it yourself so you can prove the existence of data for any reason in the future without relying on a third party?

5. Is it a remote client who fears man-in-the-middle attacks yet trusts a certificate authority?

If you're in case 1 then you should follow the instructions [Microsoft](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/independent-certification-authority-b06cfc76-56a1-4a74-b2dd-91a55de79cdf) (or whichever corporation the client is dependent on) provides. This is my conclusion after a few hours of searching and thinking.

If you're in case 2, 3, or 4, then you really don't need a certificate authority to vouch for your identity. Just physically talk to them.

Case 5 is like case 1 except the client hasn't identified a trusted certificate authority who will dictate what programs to use. See the short answer.

**If you're open to dropping your requirement of having a certificate authority then keep reading. Otherwise, see the short answer at the top.**

I'm biased towards using software that respects the [Four Freedoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software#Definition_and_the_Four_Freedoms) that the [GNU Project](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) is based on. So, in my opinion, answering your question boils down to two choices:

1. Use a one-size-fits-all program like GnuPG.

2. Use a [set of simpler tools](https://twitter.com/AaronToponce/status/1214590620682969088).

### 1. Choice one: One-size-fits all

GnuPG is a complex program which can do the following:

* [email signing and encryption with Thunderbird](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/enigmail/),

* [document version control with Git](https://git-scm.com/book/id/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work)

* [remote login with OpenSSH](https://opensource.com/article/19/4/gpg-subkeys-ssh)

* [password management with Pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/)

### 2. Choice 2: Simpler tools

These are programs recommended by a sysadmin (?) I follow [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AaronToponce) used to host PGP key signing events at [OpenWest](https://openwest.org/) ( a Salt Lake City open source conference ). In the past year he has redirected people away from using PGP and instead towards [simpler programs](https://twitter.com/AaronToponce/status/1214590620682969088) that ""do one thing well"".

* https://github.com/signalapp/ - Send text or files with public/private keys via graphical user interface (GUI) and developer-hosted server.

* https://github.com/FiloSottile/age - Encrypt files with public/private keys via command line interface (CLI).

* https://github.com/skeeto/enchive - Encrypt files with public/private keys via CLI.

* https://github.com/tarsnap/scrypt - Encrypt files with password via CLI.

* https://github.com/jedisct1/minisign - Sign files via CLI (signatures compatible with signify).

* https://github.com/aperezdc/signify - Sign files via CLI.

* https://github.com/warner/magic-wormhole - Send text or files with password via CLI and developer-hosted server.

For example, if your goal is to be able to prove that a certain email existed at a certain time then you might export the email to an EML file, use `minisign` to create a signature file for the EML file on your own computer, then archive the files in your long-term backup system. You might go a step further and use [OpenTimestamps](https://opentimestamps.org/) to prove the file existed using the hashpower of the Bitcoin blockchain in case whoever is doing the verifying doesn't trust your backup system's integrity.

## Summary

There's a tension in your question that I'm not sure can be relieved without pushing against some of your requirements. This tension is your soft requirement that the solution involve a trusted certificate authority to vouch for you and the fact that you're posting on /r/GnuPG. To me, GnuPG is software built from a herd of cats all in mild-conflict with one another but generally tending towards making software that follows the [Four Freedoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software#Definition_and_the_Four_Freedoms). A general principle of the Four Freedoms is that software should serve people and not the other way around. Not freedom-friendly certificate authorities that charge you to trust them not to revoke your public key (see [whatever Microsoft recommends](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/independent-certification-authority-b06cfc76-56a1-4a74-b2dd-91a55de79cdf)) are all I could find after several hours of searching for alternatives to GnuPG for your question.

Without a need for a certificate authority and with my free software bias, then finding the best option turns into a question of what kind of free and open source software to use (few complex tools vs. many simple tools).

Otherwise, if you trust a certificate authority then you'll end up doing what they recommend.",fgnen9u,2020-02-06 07:54:01,3
ronnie_s,"
&gt;Many in the cryptocurrency space like coins like Bitcoin because they are not only not inflationary, but deflationary. There's a limited number minted and many are permanently lost. Governments can't print more at a whim. With stablecoins, it's still pegged to the very assets many want to escape. Which might be what you want, depending on the use case.

Fixed supply assets are volatile, rendering them pretty unsuitable as currencies. You can't buy a house with something that can moves 10% in 30 mins. These things aren't going to ""suddenly"" stabilise someday either due to their structure. 

&gt;It's also decentralized, meaning governments can control exchanges (for now) but not the coin itself. As long as there are miners or stakers or whatever else they come up with, you're free to do whatever you want with it with no third party telling you what you can and cannot do. That's pretty unique in history.

Yup that's cool, but at any time regulators could theoretically forbid fiat and payment gateways from doing business with exchanges, as a result the secondary market value of cryptos would plummet severely. They'd still be around, but would likely be extremely low value, and a huge amount of interest in crypto is tied to trading (99% last check)

Also for the decentralised part; in the real world it has it's uses (mostly within inafrastructure and tech) but a modern government is extremely unlikely to ever create fully decentralised national tender for obvious reasons, lack of control over inflation, inability to mitigate crises, etc

&gt;And there's also a large sort of prepper/hedging side of things. With the massive global debt and negative interest rates and stock market in what looks to be bubble territory, many see it as a potential hedge against a crash or even global collapse. I also own some silver for that same reason. And beans. Lots of beans. ;)

While cryptos may increase like gold in a recession, I wouldn't count on them too much in any sort of prepper post apocalyptic scenarion, need stable internet/electricity for that. Oh there will be recessions, but a full on global systemic crisis like 2008 is much less likely. That was the most severe since 1929 and major currencies barely moved. Since then we have put a metric shit-ton of controls, regulations, laws, measures to squeeze as much risk out of commercial and private banking (and shadow banking) as possible. Not to say it can't come from a diff angle, just it's less likely to have the same impact as 2008",fgnfx1t,2020-02-06 08:07:03,3
diradder,"This Bilderberg conspiracy bullshit gets upvoted on r/CryptoCurrency now too?

It used to be fairly limited to the conspiracy nut containment zone that r\/btc is... I guess it deserves clarifications here too then (unless it's just BCH'ers brigading again).

Think critically for a second guys, the mere fact that a big investment group with funds dedicated to investments in the cryptocurrency space decided to invest in one of the companies supporting the most popular coin is in no way an evidence that their investment (through a VC) gives them ANY form of control over Bitcoin.

Even if tomorrow the GitHub repo of Bitcoin was renamed ""AXA's Bitcoin"", it still would not give them any control over Bitcoin's network. Miners and users are free to choose any of the multiple Bitcoin node implementation available to them, or even fork the Bitcoin Core repo, or even just not update... They all currently choose Bitcoin Core because it regroups the most prolific developers for this coin and offers the most productive framework for collaborative development. A place where consensus among developers can happen.

SloppySynapses,"In my opinion, there is no real ""rejection"" until the market fails to reclaim a previous support area after going under it. This entire rally has succeeded at flipping every single resistance area into support the whole way up

So for example a much more reliable ""rejection"" criteria would be dumping to $8900-$9100 and then failing to get past $9400-$9430 after that. 

Until then, it's just normal market movements. It's silly to expect bitcoin to go straight up.

The problem with this kind of criteria is you will miss tops and bottoms (unless you like gambling or guessing based on other criteria, personally I enjoy this so I do it lol) but it's a much easier, more objective way to be patient and not get antsy about opening or closing a position too early.

I'm not saying that we're definitely going to moon, but this is a pretty solid set up. Given where we were a year ago - this is a _big_ win.

I'm taking this alt movement as a sign that the market has an appetite for more risk, which is perfect.

We've got a clear path ahead, some runway to work with.

If bitcoin goes up a bit more we could start to see some very positive media coverage. Sparking a virtuous cycle where increased attention leads to new money entering the system which leads to more bullish PA --&gt; more news coverage --&gt; more new money...

jimjacksonsjamboree,"The term you're looking for is ""fungible"". Gold is a commodity as it has production value. Historically, anything can be used as a currency, but for the last thousand years or so, hardly anyone considers anything other than a government backed note to be currency, because for something to be a good currency it has to be stable, and crypto is anything but stable. Many actual government backed ""currencies"" fail this test due to hyper inflation and other fuckery. Those economies almost always revert to bartering or using another country's currency because an unstable currency isn't really a currency.

It's pedantic to say ""bitcoin is a currency"". Anything is currency. Bitcoin is just another valueless thing that people have gotten together and decided is valuable. It's not any different than an IOU. In effect, it's bartering. Which is why I said it's just another thing to barter for.

Bitcoin backers can say it's currency all they want but it's a really poor currency. It's treated much more like a commodity by hedge funds and people who actually do economics for a living. The CFTC has classified it as a commodity and it is regulated as such.",fgqec03,2020-02-07 05:55:39,16

vitaminBTC,"Read up on Peter Thiels idea of going from 0 to 1.

Bitcoin was created in stealth by developers who had no clue what reaction the world would have towards it. Governments and central banks are directly threatened by it.

Imagine what it must have been like. The best parallel I have found to it, is the signing of the declaration of independence. They were putting their names on it and they did not know if they would end up hung, but the possibility was very much there. 

Bitcoin also has this aspect, they had no clue what would happen. They must have understood that they were running some very serious risks against some dark forces. 

Any new project takes the open source nature of Bitcoin and dresses it up in a slightly different way. The difference between bitcoin and altcoin is infinitesimal when compared to the difference of Bitcoin and no bitcoin. 

Bitcoin throws off people from its wagon because the ride is supremely bumpy and filled with near death experiences, real and imagined.

The long term thought that went into it is severely undervalued. The last of the Bitcoin mining will occur in 2134. That is, Satoshi thought to extend the issuance many generations into the future. This tells you that Bitcoin is the tip of the iceberg, and all of the pre-work and failures that came before it were needed to come to this profound and world altering creation that was orphaned in its infancy by its creator.

Bitcoins foundations began to be laid in the 1970s with the work of cryptography and incrementally kept on being added until a very genius and creative individual /s in one fell swoop checkmated the world's most powerful interests.

Bitcoin gives the bearer the right to exchange value wherever they please, without borders or middlemen. The current protocol caps the supply at 21,000,000 by ~2044. With about 17.9 million mined, only 0.0023% of the population can own a whole coin. By 2040, global population is expected to be around 9 billion, keeping that 0.0023% figure pretty consistent as time goes by.

Taxi medallions reached a peak price of over $1,000,000 just a short time ago.

Ask yourself--which provides more utility? What would you rather own long term? What do you think others would choose, if given the choice? Why is Bitcoin different?

Fungibility is one of the main advantages of Monero because every coin has no history and thus is identical. It's pretty much digital gold. You can't have that on a transparent chain.

Miky06,"1) yes it is. taproot expenditures can't be distinguished while MAST can so they are far more private

2) yes it is. taproot requires as much onchain space as a basic transaction while MAST requires more, so it's cheaper

3) no it is not. taproot uses the same security assumptions of schnorr (which is slightly more secure than ECDSA) 
The crypto in schnorr has already been reviewed a long time ago by a lot of people, long before Bitcoin was even a thing

4) I'm not enough expert on the subject to have a conclusive opinion but to me this implementation is good

5) not ""jamming features"" would be worse since having them separated would add a lot of complexity, and we really need schnorr + taproot.
schnorr and taproot are really linear together so there is no point on having them separated and they are clear and optimal upgrades on what we have now.

besides we already have signature aggregation and eltoo postponed for a future upgrade so there is no bundle of features.

MAST to the on the other hand is suboptimal and there is really no merit in implementing it no matter what.

schnorr can be used without taproot so there is really no problem at all and these concerns hold no water

all in all, people with a little knowledge about the upgrade could not possibly have this kind of concerns.

this is not an honest email, it's the writing of some one trying to spread FUD

iveyballer,"Please correct my logic if I am mistaken, but there is no possible way that the halving could be fully priced into BTC right now. It is true that some amount of investors may be accumulating BTC in anticipation of the halving. However, the main reason that the price increases so much is because the mining rewards are reduced by 50%. Miners account for the majority of sellers on any given day because they sell their rewards to pay for their mining operations. When their rewards are cut in half, their effective sell pressure is also cut in half. If all things stay the same, this will result is less sellers to buyers than currently, which makes the price go up. This built in mechanism is also necessary for miners because their operations are at risk if their revenue gets cut in half over night. They need the value of their tokens to increase in order to fund their operations with less mining rewards. 

TLDR: bitcoin halving isn’t priced in. the halving actually needs to occur before it moves the market. Miners will have 50% less rewards to sell on the market. Less sellers to buyers means the price goes up. BTC has a very high probability of tremendously increasing in value in the future.",fh6rptm,2020-02-10 12:14:25,9

CryptoStrategies,"Any merchant still accepting BTC should immediately upgrade to Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which is the version of Bitcoin that still functions as P2P electronic cash. This crippling exploit touted as a ""feature"" by the hostile Blockstream controlled developers who added it, has become even easier to execute than what I had previously demonstrated. Now transactions can be ""cancelled"" (reversed) by pressing a single button within the popular BlueWallet for BTC/LN. 

Bitcoin Cash continues the whitepaper mission to become the first global electronic cash for the world, and is rightly beginning to receive the recognition it deserves as ‘Bitcoin’ in the proper sense of the word.

In one of my MBA classes Friday, the discussion was cryptocurrency, and most people were more positive on Ethereum than Bitcoin both in the short and long term.

shittymorph,"That takes me back :)  - So much has happened since that first comment... I was in a pretty dark place when I started looking for laughs with this.  I had just finished cleaning out my fathers house after his death... official cause of death was ""unknown due to decomposition"" and I had been tasked to clean out his house where his body had been found.  It was 100+ degrees around his house when he died and he didn't have an A/C unit.  His body decomposed quickly and pretty much melted into the floor.  The mattress he had died on was obviously removed... and so was the floor under it... and then the dirt under the subfloor needed to be excavated... I could never get that smell of death out of my mind and had to deal with it for the 30 days while I packed up his belongings.  While cleaning out his house I found 3 suicide notes in envelopes next to several empty pill bottles... also a book on different ways of committing suicide earmarked.  Most of his belongings had to be tossed out as everything smelled like death...  I wasn't in a good financial place and was living in an old RV parked on some abandoned property.  It was in the old RV sitting at the ""kitchen table"" when this all started - and after that first comment I laughed out loud for about 10 minutes.

Things got better for me for a while... Bitcoin went through the roof and I had managed to get my hands on a few - so when it hit 15k or so I sold them.  Bought myself a good car, sold that RV, and moved into a rental house.  From there life has had it's ups and downs but that was def. a low point for me when this started... a VERY low point.  In a weird way the entire Undertaker thing was a way for me to laugh and smile - something I didn't do much back then.  Anyway, I know most of you are expecting this end a certain way but I wanted to get serious for a minute and mention what all this means to me.  Thank you all for laughing with me... it really means a lot to me.  &lt;3 - SM",fh7bc23,2020-02-10 17:23:52,10

I was all over the map when I first got the crypto bug in Dec 2017, right when everything went nuts.. again.

Augur, Komodo, 0x, Litecoin, EOS, Lisk, IOTA, ZenCash, Verge.. everything was so exciting. Every white paper seemed to make sense and every project had a cool story and I thought for sure everything was going to skyrocket.. as it was.

Screw Bitcoin, everything else looked better.. built on Javascript or C++, hey that sounds good, there are lots of developers, those will moon for sure! It's all about who can get it done first no doubt!

Time goes on and I get whitepaper fatigue. I couldn't stand to see any more talk of ""revolutionary approach"" to ""disrupting a Trillion dollar industry"" to ""rebuilding the global financial landscape"".. with a leadership team of 4 and 14 team members..

Then through the channels I ended up on Cardano, and it wasn't even the whiteboard video, I found that later. They didn't have a whitepaper (fun fact: they still don't have a whitepaper) but there was a lot of sciency stuff and long mathy papers nobody understands. I was attracted to the depth of the research and figured this must be something good if they are going full academia on it.

I can't remember for sure but I think this was the first video I watched, and I probably watched it 3 times.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1fNLSjAgHg

Then I watched this one 2 or 3 times

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_QLfnucgh0

Then I watched this one probably 5 times

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1fNLSjAgHg

Then I watched the whiteboard video.  Only twice tho I think.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja9D0kpksxw

Pretty much after this, I found every video related to Cardano and everything else, literally everything else in crypto, feels weak. Cardano was purpose built to address or complete solve every issue with Ethereum and Bitcoin and through numerous videos we come to understand the whole picture of Cardano, and why every other project will falter on their own merits. (of course on the understanding that Charles properly understands his own proposition in comparison to the competition.)

With this foundation, and the subsequent 2018 and 2019 persistent updates, we get to see the clear vision and plan of attack for Cardano. From conception it was never to take on big money head on, it was always going to go after the most difficult financial markets possible and if it could survive there, it would naturally percolate up and force big money to comply to work with these emerging markets.

Everything about this project is a breading ground for success and opportunity. Everything. Cardano is going to succeed, because it has the most complete vision of how to succeed.

It's amazing they are doing everything so fast.

&gt; His innovation is blocked.

&gt; Then, his own bicycle.

You can't blame Amaury, or any other Bitcoin Cash developer, for having to fork Bitcoin to bigger blocks. That's on BTC Core's refusal to scale.

Bitcoin Cash isn't someone's ""own bicycle"". It was a huge group effort by devs, miners, exchanges, wallet / app devs, etc.

---

You see a pattern of endless forks due to developers.

But developers alone cannot create a successful fork. There must be a huge community need and economic pressure or at least incentive for it to result in a persistent, valuable coin.

See BCD and endless other forks of Bitcoin - many probably created by teams for hire just to sow confusion shortly after the time of the Bitcoin Cash fork. Where are they now? Bottom of the bargain bin.

The market doesn't follow our time preference. It can stay irrational longer than many of us can stay solvent. None of that means forks are useless.

Without them, Bitcoin would already be deader than a dodo because instead of creating Bitcoin Cash, we would've all left to go elsewhere - if there had been a better alternative.

In one hand you have slightly worse market prices, on the other you have to deal with several fees and exchange rates before even starting to buy ADA.

Academic_Crypto,"I want to bring some attention to OKEx quarterly Bitcoin futures.  This product has been going nuts for the duration of this rally from 6ks. A lot of people look at BitMEX and their funding rates and futures premiums, but consider this, currently OKEx March 27th futures are trading $70 above MEX's March 27th futures while the USDT spot market is trading $60 below the USD spot market. This means that relatively speaking the OKEx quarterly future is trading at a substantial premium to the MEX equivalent. 

To be specific, the OKEx quarterly is currently trading at about a 460USDT premium to spot with an expiration date just 44 days away. That contract also lead the rally today and has in the past month been a frequent leader of bullish price action. I had a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/eqrje6/daily_discussion_sunday_january_19_2020/feximks?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) a few weeks ago where I documented that large orders on OKEx futures are 5/5 on calling tops and bottoms. 

Futures premiums can be thought of as a premium that people are willing to pay to borrow money / trade on margin as opposed to making the same spot bet. The following plot is the derived borrowing rate from the OKEx futures premium in the past 8 months or so [(Image)](https://imgur.com/5bCOiyU). As you can see, the current implied borrowing rate has exceeded 0.1% per day and has been going parabolic in the last month. This means that by longing OKEx futures, users are essentially taking an extremely high interest loan to be long Bitcoin. 

Also interesting is the historic trading volume on the quarterly futures [(Image)](https://imgur.com/BJ3Rnu8). There have been 4 times in history that the contract has traded with high volume. (1) The ATH run, (2) Summer 2018 when the [large OKEx liquidation w/ socialized losses](https://fortune.com/2018/08/03/okex-losses-among-counter-parties/) took place on that contract, (3) the run to 14k and (4) now.  These periods of excitement tend to align with the expiration of the quarterly futures. For example last Summer the quarterly expired on June 14th and the volume immediately dropped and never really recovered.

It is unclear to me if this means up or down, but I am wondering if we will soon see a blow-off-top in the implied lending rate of the OKEx future and if their volume will die off once this march 27th contract expires.",fhclqgy,2020-02-12 08:59:30,3

Bitcoin peaked at $766 on Jun 16 2016. Halving came 23 days later on July 9 (price had fallen to $650).

LogrisTheBard,"Every shard has an execution environment. BTC's EE on that shard would not change what BTC could do. However it would change the block finalization mechanics. You can vaguely think of the EE as the thing that generates the blocks and the beacon chain as the thing that picks which blocks are valid. The mechanism for validity would change from proof of work to proof of stake using ETH for staking. So then, what is btc valuable for? The BTC chain will never let this happen.

The hard takeover will be when something like tBTC catches on. People who want access to the functionality of ETH (which Bitcoin can never provide) will use wBTC, tBTC, or the next thing to get their bitcoin on the ETH blockchain. At which point, why would we need a BTC shard anyway? What functionality does BTC have that another crypto does not? If all you're accessing is its value then a wBTC equivalent solution is adequate and requires no permission from the BTC chain. It simply can't be stopped.

Academic_Crypto,"I just want to give a run-down on what happened in the market in the last half day or so. I didn't read this whole thread so there is a chance someone else already caught it, but in case they didn't here is my take.

About half a day ago BTCUSD pushed to $10,500ish, a lot of alt-coins were having some pretty big rallies, and a large player on BitMEX tried to short the top. They started with a few 5M market sells to create momentum and then a steady stream of smaller market sells for about 3 hours. In the following [(Image)](https://imgur.com/S24amZK) we can see that Open Interest (OI) and Open Value (OV) spiked a lot during this dump to \~$10,100. The reason for this is that the selling was entirely new short contracts opening while the buying side was a combination of shorts closing and longs opening resulting in a net positive increase in OI and OV. 

Now lets shift gears and look at OKEx. I found a great plot of the BTC Basis of the OKEx quarterly future over the last few years [(Image)](https://imgur.com/LFPDZNo). This plot is showing the price of Bitcoin on the left-y-axis and the premium of the quarterly futures contract on the right-y-axis in USD. What you can see is that in the past few weeks, that futures contract has sustained a premium higher than it has ever had before by a very wide margin, being 5-10x higher than it has been in the past on average. Another thing that makes this so significant is that the premium of the futures contract represents a price of borrowing money from the current time until the contract expiration, and so if the borrowing rate is constant,  the **premium should decrease linearly** as the expiration of the contract draws closer, but this particular quarterly futures has been **growing linearly** which implies that **the borrowing rate has been increasing quadratically**. This is an [(Image)](https://imgur.com/5bCOiyU) of this value that I calculated explicitly for the last few months using 4-hour time windows which clearly shows this parabolic trend. OKEx futures are also hitting record open values according to this [(Image)](https://imgur.com/eRTio1U) and have been hitting new highs every day. 

Now getting back to the recent price action. OKEx has been running this market for the past few months, and when a price movement has been initiated by BitMEX it has generally failed unless OKEx and other asian exchanges such as Huobi and Binance were in agreement. The large short by BitMEX was no different. After the short position was opened on BitMEX, OKEx drove the price back up and caused the shorter to cover [(Image)](https://imgur.com/S24amZK) around $10,250, driving the price back up to $10,500 which was probably break-even for the shorter. Once OKEx bullied this BitMEX guy out of his short, they closed their long [(Image)](https://imgur.com/1dDG0Hl) which dropped the OV on the quarterly future from about 76,500 BTC to 70,000 BTC and traded 9.5k BTC in contracts in just under 3 minutes. Notice how the volume traded on OKEx was very different between the first and second dump where the first dump was mostly arbitraged to them from the BitMEX selling and the second dump was initiated by sellers on that product. Not shown is that open value was stable on the first dump for OKEx and dropped on the second whereas open value increased on BitMEX for the first dump and was stable on the second. 

What I take away from this is that OKEx has probably been a huge factor in the market pumping in the last few months, and this is the first sign I have seen of open value decreasing there, or significant selling coming from there. If OKEx stops buying and switches to taking profits then I suspect this is the top. Their quarterly futures contract is still incredibly over extended and near all-time-highs in a number of scary metrics including BTC Basis and Open Value.",fhilft3,2020-02-14 05:50:43,19

Henry_the_pelican,"This article is extremely important in my view and explains what is likely about to happen next to BCH and BTC - and why. Reading between the lines here, I believe Craig may be expecting some trouble ahead for himself legally as the ""Issuer"" of Bitcoin. He mentions ""whatever happens to me"" in this article and this also appears to be a common theme within his Coingeek China conference video.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClANV8QAeQw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClANV8QAeQw)

He makes a number of references to Ghandi, Rosa Parkes and Mandela among others - the common thread being people who have been imprisoned for their beliefs/actions and for trying to bring about a better World - I believe Craig may be a similar case.

If you consider that he originally avoided being associated with being the ""Issuer"", by using a pseudonym for years (probably because of legal implications for being a money issuer) then it makes sense.

Craig only came out as Satoshi when he absolutely had to - due to the protocol having become bastardised by others. This would also explain his reticence to come forward and his hesitation around the time of the signings - he was basically forced into a corner. This also suggests what he was likely being blackmailed about around the same time.

It looks to me that Craig has now definitively faced the threats and slurs in order to bring about his vision of a better World......whatever the personal cost, even if it endangers his own personal freedom.

No, he won't give up his bus seat!, No he won't bow down to bullying and threats!

micropresident,"&gt;Regardless of the hard work done by  members of BU to create useful software for Bitcoin Cash, and its  continued commitment towards peer-to-peer electronic cash for the past 5  years, ABC will unfortunately never allow any of BU’s work to go into  the BCH protocol willingly.

This is your assertion, and it doesn't match reality.  It is very much invalidated by nChain getting multiple proposals in, as well as Mark Lunderberg getting his proposals in. Tobias Ruck just landed a proposal in the ABC code base. Additionally, the SegWit recovery patch was landed by another third party.One BU change was landed under a name that more closely matches the rest of the opcodes (OP\_CHECKDATASIG)

1. OP\_DATASIGVERIFY Andrew Stone was invited to review and participate in the specification for OP\_CDS. Instead, he refused to participate and chose to ignore the very real and reasonable feedback he was given by Amaury, Chris Pacia, and Clemens Ley. OP\_CDS was ultimately landed and was based on Andrew's work.  He could have been a co-author on the spec but he refused to participate.

The rest of the BU proposals can be dismissed almost immediately as making no technical sense:

1. Extensible Script doesn't make any sense due to needing to hash the unrolled script at every node to verify the TxID.
2. OP\_UNIQUE provides no value as a consensus level change.  This can be done off-chain indexing service.  There's no point in excluding transactions with a particular set of data if you index only the first transaction that contains it.
3. OP\_GROUP was reviewed multiple times as well, and is a very specific solution to a very general problem.  OP\_CDS has opened up more options for this than OP\_GROUP did.  What remains is to test larger scriptSig limits and push limits -- but nobody has taken the effort.  If that were done, real, miner-verified, tokens might be a reality on BCH.

&gt;Secondly, BitcoinABC does not take a collaborative approach to  development. All decisions and features are dictated by BitcoinABC.

Real world evidence contradicts this assertion, as given above.  Bitcoin-ABC has no obligation to include ridiculous proposals in its codebase.  What's interesting is that you are tacitly asserting that Bitcoin-ABC has control over the BCH protocol.  How is that possible?

&gt;Through its financial strategy  Bitcoin Unlimited has been able to maintain its independence and  financial sustainability and has therefore remained in a strong position  to support Bitcoin Cash. BU’s officials and membership have continually  made good decisions that have allowed BU to provide long-term support  for the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem.

Bitcoin Unlimited's contribution to Bitcoin Cash has been a net negative.  I started participating in Bitcoin Cash development around August 10th of 2017 after the split.  I had no opinion of any actors in this space.  As soon as I got involved it was clear that Tom Harding, Andrew Stone, Thomas Zander were toxic and spiteful, but it was unclear to me why.  As I learned the history of the big block movement it became clear what was going on.  They were red with jealousy over the fact that Amaury Sechet had accomplished what they could not -- **a functioning hard fork**.  This cohort of individuals are the lead developers of Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin Classic respectively.

They have repeatedly done everything in their power to tear Bitcoin ABC and Amaury down over the last 3 years.  When called out, they deny, attack, and reverse the role of victim and offender.  This article is another example of the leadership of Bitcoin Unlimited having a victim mentality.

But what exactly are they a victim of? They have, by their own admission, more BCH than any other development team (despite having only the negative contribution of wasting other people's time and creating controversy).

However, it gets significantly worse than what you said. Because moving around BTC is extraordinarily &amp; wildly expensive (**significantly more than ""just a few dimes""**) with unpredictable &amp; rising fees that you can never predict in advance. 

Moving around BTC is always unreliable &amp; slow because you never know when it will get into the next block — today? tomorrow? next week? Maybe it will get rejected from the mempool altogether?

And if you try to use the LN — which isn't Bitcoin because it's a centralized, custodial, complex system of IOU's that isn't permissionless, requires trust, does not scale, and doesn't work — well, if you do all of that, [your funds will likely get lost altogether](https://twitter.com/derykmakgill/status/1227960674246107136?s=20)!

He was pleased with the talk, and we talked about gaming and stuff. Turns out he's a huge Starcraft nerd.

Even when we dumped 700k repeatedly on them."" I asked him if he was going to try and conquer the crypto by absorbing the entire space in a joking manner, and he looked at me with a straight face and answered ""That's a good question, and we're not planning to do that though. First after we're milking the market, we'll dump everything all at once."" It was at this point I noticed the smell of alchohol on his breath, as he had started to lean in closer, not very easy on your nose when it's combined with Big Macs. ""Then with all our money, we're planning on pumping Nano, since we've identified that it will take over Bitcoin."" I was disgusted by what I heard, and asked about the google partnership. ""Google doesn't know anything, we basically just copied Mobius code, and they went with it."" I shook my head in disbelief and went home immediately and market sold my chainlink at the price of $4.55 per token. The price dumped almost moments after.

drawingthesun,"Bitcoin is money. 


Ethereum is money and code. 



Tezos is money, code and governance. 


If you think there is even a remote chance decentralized governance of a platform is viable then Tezos is likely a worthwhile bet. 


It does many other things very well too. The PoS is very advanced, the inflation keeps most stakers active, the smart contracts language is less prone to bugs. (Not saying bugs are not possible however)


Buts its core concept is governance and in time the community can literally vote in new features, code bases, etc in a way that doesn’t hinge on a central development group. 


As an extreme example the community could vote new coins into existence to pay for development of advanced features to remain competitive for all time. It’s a very dynamic system. 


We likely won’t need to use the extreme form of these powers, especially coin creation for a very long time as the Foundation has a multi hundred million dollar warchest and has been putting it to good use.",fhvy2m1,2020-02-17 10:30:21,10

Don't use the same password for any two sites. Don't even have passwords that share common elements between those two sites. Implement a password manager (like lastpass, onepassword, or bitwarden) so that you can have strong, unique passwords for every service you use.

nodecache,"The key, I maintain, to what's happening, is btc.d and the multiyear trendline of support that was breached almost two weeks ago.  In a real bear market, bitcoin thrives on a relative basis and alts get slaughtered.  Decent argument that there's a leg of prehalving bitcoin movement that slaughters alts too, my assertion is that that is what already happened in late 2019.  If I'm right about us being past that stage, btc.d will continue to trend down and we'll see more price action that looks like early 2017.  

Right now we've got 3 sizable green candles pushing btc.d back up towards the two year trendline.  Not really surprising since there were like two straight weeks of red candles before that.  The question we might get to test soon if more green candles appear is: has old support become new resistance?  Will btc.d bounce down from that trendline?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/JLcsa8jG/

If that resistance holds, I don't care what's happening with fiat, AFAIC, we're in for a good year.  btc.d being down isn't some universal good thing, but at this stage of the cycle, it is, for the entire market including bitcoin.  It's just at that place in the circle of life where the whole ecosystem benefits from some leadership churn.  If that resistance doesn't hold, then my theory is crap.",fhwh6r6,2020-02-17 14:02:02,6

MP32Gaming,"Be aware that what happened with Bitcoin can and does happen with stocks, too.

The market's happy right now and I'd start with investing first. Investing can be as easy as buying blue-chip companies (Apple, MS, Starbucks) literally all of the big name brands. Or you could dive deeper into it. Investopedia provides a lot of great resources for investing/trading for beginners. Just don't mess with options for a long time or put all $500 into penny stocks. The last thing you wanna do is lose the majority of your money.

A couple of things to keep in mind when/if you begin trading:

\-The market is very fair and usually the trades that *can* have a ridiculously high return rate typically are more risky and have a lower probability of success. While trades that yield a lower rate of return *typically* have a higher probability of success.

\- Fully understand how to manage risk aka don't make a trade where if it goes wrong you lose $100+ in a $500 account. Keep your loses small.

\- Keep in mind the word I said a few times in the first point; *probability.* It's all probabilities, there's no such thing as a guaranteed 100% winning trade. Sometimes you'll have an A+ set-up and things just go against you. It happens. So that's why you have to know how to manage your risk.

\- Spend as much time as you can learning how to manage risk. I've mentioned it this many times, because learning how to ***lose*** is the most important thing when it comes to trading. How much are you willing to lose per trade? How much are you willing to lose per day? Per week? It's a business and winning won't put you out of business, but losing will. You need to know your risk tolerance and how to properly lose without it driving you crazy emotionally or putting your account out of business.",fhwkxq2,2020-02-17 15:00:01,7

Big_Bubbler,"   
   My first impression is that monetizing protocol development is not the same as monetizing projects built on top. [Bitcoin.com](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=lbaqmB7JK9t246H6AYo60CFyv7J8MTU4MjA0MzQwN0AxNTgxOTU3MDA3&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fbitcoin.com%2F&amp;stzid=UgzwflxZz3HSXqnMcYJ4AaABAg&amp;event=comments) is a business. ABC is a non-profit team trying to make peer-to-peer electronic cash for the world's people. I think that's the priority and further delays on the ability to scale for massive worldwide adoption (go viral) may have tragic results if we get the chance to do that and we are not ready.  

 I think Roger may have said he thinks we have been progressing on protocol development fast enough? If so, I heartily disagree. We are moving so slowly we may miss the window of opportunity, I do not care if ABC does the code work, but, I think we need scaling (massive) sooner rather than years later.  

If anyone wanted to fund ABC or any node it would have been easy without the need to use a censorship-based platform like Patreon. They have options out there.  

I love Roger and know he generally means well. He has a business and maybe he has to protect that by avoiding too much controversy, but, he consistently fails to stand up for Bitcoin when it is under attack by one of these community splitting social engineering attacks until it is too late for his support to be much help at keeping the community together. Luckily C Wright wrote him a nasty letter before the BSV fork that eventually made his decision easier that time.  I

 do agree the process is horrible and Amaury should not be choosing who gets funding. I do not think the limited funding should go to BU or [Bitcoin.com](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=lbaqmB7JK9t246H6AYo60CFyv7J8MTU4MjA0MzQwN0AxNTgxOTU3MDA3&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fbitcoin.com%2F&amp;stzid=UgzwflxZz3HSXqnMcYJ4AaABAg&amp;event=comments) or any business that is already monetized. I think we need it for protocol development. After we pretty much finish the protocol, if miners still want to donate their rewards, we could support things on top of the underlying infrastructure. I also think we should have more accounting and accountability. So, ya, this plan sucks, but, it is better than no plan and the opposition has no better plan yet. 

 BCH is under attack from anti-Bitcoin forces all the time. They see this issue as a major opportunity and we need to get the community together to stand up to the attack fork they are currently developing. They will have plenty of miner support from miners pretending to be pro-BCH miners and they will pretend their fork is the real Bitcoin as they always do.   

If they get their way we will split and/or we will block BCH miners from being able to work as a group to automate donations to the developers. Remember, this is BCH-Miners trying to donate to BCH developers. It is not a great or total solution, but, people who oppose miners donating to developers need to rethink why they are doing that. This is the miners money and they should be allowed to donate it as they see fit. 

I also want to add that I think this needs to be voluntary for the BCH miners. I agree a vote will be gamed. I think creating mining pools specifically created or designated as volunteering to donate would allow the pro BCH miners to vote by joining the pools. If there is enough of them to mine BCH without help, the vote succeeds and those pools donate. Miners can come and go if they don't like how their donations are getting spent.",fhxnke4,2020-02-18 01:52:08,1

The same way you find anything in normal life.  By looking around.

I'm from Generation X, one of the DIY generations, where we rejected centralized corporations and governments, and figured out how to do our own thing, independently.  We formed interest groups and used those to help us all find what we needed.

If you want to trade Bitcoin, find a Bitcoin group in your area, or online.  Or just ask around in whatever communication venues you normally use.

nullc,"Wow. Thanks for catching that.

What you are witnessing is malicious dishonesty by this subreddit's moderators, sadly.  Until no more than a day ago the flair was something like ""bitcoin developer"" (with an icon) and I had it disabled.  Unfortunately moderators of this subreddit-- who are paid employees of Roger Ver and Roger himself-- can change it at any time.

Last night about at the same moment Roger posted that maliciously false post accusing me of committing a crime, I noticed that it was re-enabled and read ""Former Blockstream CTO"".  I disabled it again.

Now I see that it's been changed to ""Greg Maxwell, CTO of Blockstream"", reenabled, and that the subreddit theme is preventing me from seeing it myself!   I've disabled it again, but presumably they'll just force it back on.

Here is what I see:

if I disable the subreddit theme, instead I see:

https://people.xiph.org/~greg/temp/rbtc.flair2.png

abarnare,"the conclusion of the SEC case and the massive precedent setting victory is going to generate a ton of publicity. The coming major partnership announcements, exchange listings, the Code app, and price increase of Kin will bring even more publicity. Speaking engagements and media interviews with Ted and other ecosystem advocates will have the same effect. Large venture capitalist firms and crypto influencers will be talking about it.  The FOMO is going to spread. The bull run is going to be massive. Developers will flood into the ecosystem so they too can participate in the KRE business model. Its not going to stop. Commercials like Osnat produced in December aren't going to achieve 25% of what I just mentioned in terms of getting the word out about Kin. I dont understand how so many of you dont understand that the SEC case has placed liquidity, partnerships, investors, and marketing on hold. Its not that KF cant figure it out. Its just the way it is. Its destiny. The SEC case is a gift. Its an opportunity of your lifetime to acquire coins from unsatisfied and impatient ICO investors at a huge discount. This trial could be the best thing that ever happened for the success of Kin as it will provide much needed clarity industry wide and KIN is holding the torch. The world will see. Kin will show the way. That is why Coindesk listed Ted as most influential for 2019. When people realize this its going to be huge. You thought Bitcoin going from $1 to $20,000 was cool? Wait until you see what happens with Kin. Wait until you see how this project changes the world and lets developers of all sizes work together and win together - to throw down the crushing monopolies of the past era which never had the users interests in mind.

TheQuaffle,"Some interesting crypto history for anyone who wasn't around back then. Back in 2013, there was a whale who would post on major bitcoin forums all the time. He used it as a way to manipulate the markets. He would say stuff like ""Hey, I'm about to pump 5% on Mt. Gox.""

He did it over and over, posting screenshots for truth. Every time, the manipulations got a little more extreme. ""At 13:22 GMT, I will pull the 2k BTCUSD wall"". Stuff like that. Made people lots of money.

On BTC Pizza Day, 2013, the whale announced his biggest plan yet. He was going to open a 14k BTC short in anticipation of a big BCore announcement he had insider information about. Further, he said he was working with a Mt. Gox insider to cause a short term flash crash to $212/BTC. Turns out he had quite a following, because literally thousands of people sold and set their new limit orders to 212. It was quite a meme number back then. One poster called bullshit. Everyone hated on the poor dude for days. It got so bad that he was literally banned from a couple forums for saying that there wouldn't be a flash crash.

Well it turns out the whale *did* have an insider contact. That's a story for another time. The short version is that he used his contact to do the exact opposite of what he said. He knew he could manufacture a short squeeze and used all the good will and trust he had built with the community to pull off the heist. He bought everyone's selling as the price dipped 10%. Then he set off a buying cycle that liquidated millions of dollars of shorts. Literally millions. It was the second biggest change of crypto capital until the ICO boom. (The first biggest of course was the Mt. Gox hack).

Analytics years later showed that over 98% of Mt. Gox users lost at least 10% of their stack, and 20% lost everything. Only a handful of people profited, including the whale, a few insiders, and the one man who was banned from the forums for his skepticism. That one guy ended up quadruppling his stack through contrarian trading, outperforming even the whale over the next few months. That user's name? Vitalik Buterin.",fi4nfm6,2020-02-20 05:38:23,3

1. The next BTC push would have caused a trend reversal into a bull market by rising above October
2. Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV's halving bubbles ended a few days ago
3. The upcoming BCH fork is going to drive down prices across the board as it starts to get ugly

what_mustache,"\&gt; If Bitcoin replaced the whole worlds central banking system, it would use wayyyyyyy less electricity, and would also have no employees 

Wow, this is just really, really wrong.  Does bitcoin offer mortgages?  Small business loans?  Financial services?  ATMs?  Can a poor person without a phone and dataplan walk into a grocery store and pay for food with bitcoin?  No.   Bitcoin cant possibly replace the world's banks.   

And the part of the banks that store monetary value uses a fraction of power of bitcoin.  The fact is that banks have incentives to use less power.  **Bitcoin's value is built on power consumption**. It's exactly the opposite of being green.

 \&gt; There’d be no bank collapses because bitcoin is less of a Fiat currency then pretty much every other paper currency in existence 

This is also fucking stupid.  Bitcoin's stability has been a fucking joke.  And how many times have we heard about some bitcoin wallet getting hacked?  And in the US we have the FDIC.  Banks collapsing isnt exactly an issue we deal with day to day, and the dollar is so much more stable than bitcoin that you cant compare the two.  And fiat currency has the advantage of being smoothed out by monetary policy to balance out swings in the economy.

Peter__R,"With BCH maturing, I would _love_ to see more of the ideas we're exploring written up as complete papers, put through an academic peer review process, and then published in an archival scholarly journal.  

- The number of people following GitHub repos, private Telegram channels, or this subreddit is small.  There is an entire world out there ready to get more involved in bitcoin R&amp;D but they don't even know where to look.  Peer-reviewed papers that turn up on university library or Google Scholar searches become ""hooks"" to bring new people in.

- The publishing process acts as a quality control filter.  A paper published in a peer-reviewed academic journal comes with a sort of ""stamp of approval"" that, while no guarantee that the content is correct, crazy ideas and low-quality work are filtered, and published material is framed in a scholarly context and with relevant citations.

- Writing a complete paper forces the author to convincingly explain the background around their idea and the motivation behind it.   The background, motivation and related work is usually ""obvious"" to the developers working most closely on a given topic and so in their less formal communication it is often omitted.  But this makes it difficult for people less in-the-know to understand why certain decisions were made and what's been tried before.  In other words, formal published papers creates a useful documentation trial.

- Increases the credibility of the work.

- University publishers have mature processes so that papers don't get lost.

A good example of a topic that more people should be writing papers on is difficulty adjustment algorithms (DAAs).  Tom Harding recently wrote a paper on his real-time targeting (RTT) idea (https://github.com/chain2/chain2/blob/master/specifications/rtt.pdf) which will be published in Ledger along with the transparent peer-review in the next few weeks.   Tom's is a great example of the type of paper I'd love to see more of.  It describes the problem with traditional DAAs in the presence of a changing hash rate thereby motivating his solution, and then it gives a clear presentation of his idea so that other people can reason about it and discuss. The paper then serves as a stepping stone for further work on the topic.  

I know there is active work being done on a new non-RTT DAA for BCH.  It would be wonderful to get that work written up in a paper of equal quality, allowing a greater number of people, if not to get involved, at least to understand the problem, the background around it, and so feel they have a stake in its solution.  Slowing down a bit to carefully write up our ideas and put them through peer review will help take BCH to the next level.",fi7xqbd,2020-02-21 05:19:19,2

nodecache,"Posts like this are my least favorite part of ethereumland.  There's no real need to manufacture rivalry and hostility between btc and eth, they have different lanes, they could even be friends.  But instead of mocking the tiny number of big name bitcoin maxis for not understanding that, more and more people around here just want to act like them and become ethereum maxis.  It doesn't really affect either coins' utility (for now), but it's making these communities far less bearable (which could eventually impair network effect, something both btc and ethereum have done fantastic jobs at building).  I come here a lot more often than go to bitcoinland, but I do wonder for how much longer that will be true.  

Money is, and has always been, trust (not in 3rd parties in this case, but trust in a system to deliver predictable results) and memory.  Bitcoin excels at both.  It's never going to be a decentralized global supercomputer, which is great, that means that lane is clear for eth.  But not everything needs to be a decentralized global supercomputer.  Gold's mcap is bigger than MS/Google/Amazon combined (for now), not just google cloud/azure/aws, but all the diverse businesses under the same companies too.  And gold is pretty hard to own in some parts of the world, so digital gold's global value could be much higher.

mike890730,"Coming back to the original question from OP, a bitcoin has only value because people are willing to pay some money for it, or in your specific case, give you some goods or services for it in exchange. It has nothing to do with miner costs or anything else, it's just that they are accepting it. And the idea of bitcoin as a currency will remain a niche thing for idealistic people, the majority has accepted that the ""digital gold"" narrative is more sustainable. I'm quite sure that you have extra costs and extra efforts to keep up your bitcoin-centered life, so you are doing it rather for idealistic than for economic reasons (actually you are paying extra costs directly and indirectly for using it, and either you or your business partners are taking the volatility risks).",fidbwlr,2020-02-22 18:52:22,1

pg3crypto,"KYC is bollocks though. It hasn't had any measurable impact on reducing any kind of crime, it just shifts it from one set of books to another. If anything it probably creates more crime.

I have never met a money launderer, I've never met a someone I suspect to be a money launderer. The number of people that have enough money for KYC to matter is diminishingly small compared to those that are just average folk. Even fewer are actual crim/drug/warlords.

The only measurable impact is the inconvenience it adds for the swathes and swathes of regular people just going about their lives.

Regulation is only a good thing if it protects consumers, this kind of regulation already exists. It's absolute trash if it's geared towards ""fighting the money laundering weapons dealing paedo climate change denying drug terrorists of the dark web"" that are apparently lurking in every bush waiting to get me high, shag me senseless against my will, then steal everything I have after blowing me up in the name of a fantasy character from an old book of bullshit.

I don't buy into fear, nor should anyone else.

As for Bitcoin changing the landscape of how currency works etc. Free floating currency is a newer concept than a store of value like Bitcoin. People traded with coins made of rare metals for millennia, it's only in the last century that all intrinsic value of currency was removed.

Hi there! I'm Amelia, a bisexual redhead from Scotland.

I'm the girl next door by day and the seductive siren of your nightmares by night.

Why don't you get yourself on that list and find out why redheads are the most dangerous girls?

tim0901,"&gt;He's no expert on blockchain.

No, but even without being one he's able to easily show why electronic voting is a terrible idea.

&gt;As to answer your anonymity question you can do some form of zkp or other privacy protocols to anonymize voting.

Which people who aren't incredibly knowledgeable about cybersecurity won't understand, removing trust of the system.

&gt;dont trust blockchain. You verify.

You have to trust the system in an election. That's the point. And if you are able to verify that the system is trustworthy and entering votes as people intend, then the votes being cast are clearly not anonymous.

&gt;For average user a block explorer/UI that shows a ""you have voted X candidate with your key"" is enough .

Such an explorer would have the same trust issues - how do we know it is accurately showing what is in that blockchain, and not just what it claims to have put in there? And being able to find your vote in that blockchain and verify it's integrity defeats the anonymity of the election.

&gt;Attacking a big blockchain (i guess  you mean 51% attacks) is financial suicide otherwise bitcoin/ethereum  would have been 51%  attacked everyday.

Bitcoin/etherium have far less money riding on them than an election of a big country. A 51% attack on the US presidential election would be worth trillions of dollars, far more than the entire net value of all cryptocurrencies in existence.

Besides, there are far easier attacks you can make on bitcoin than this, like hacking the exchanges and stealing people's wallets, and the exact same is true for an election blockchain. The use of blockchain does absolutely nothing to improve the security of the overall system, because there are far easier attack vectors to choose from. It's like installing a $1M lock on your front door, only to leave the window next to it wide open.",fig5wsy,2020-02-23 03:33:09,9

centinel20,"Depends on how many transactions we are able to fit into a block. Either way most small transactions can be bulked together in other ways to make it dirt cheap. The important thing is that ( and bitcoin is designed for this ) the more vluable the network, the more resources are needed to secure it. So if we are able to put billions of transactions per block ( using techniques to bulk together transactions, lightning, other solutions ) then the fees will be very juicy but the cost per transaction dirt cheap.

kobeee,"To just get a baseline understanding of Blockchain and Cryptography, I really like Dan Boneh. He's a professor at Stanford and has a lot of lectures on Youtube that help breakdown everything. He also has an online PDF that is the first part of his 'course' on Cryptography - http://toc.cryptobook.us/book.pdf

When I first invested in early 2017, I definitely just jumped in hoping for some gains and was adding coins to my portfolio left and right trying to chase gains. As I did that though, I educated myself on Cryptography and Blockchain in general and tried to understand the history of Bitcoin and how it came about. Once I had a baseline understanding of all of that it was much easier to read whitepapers and different articles on Cryptos and understand what their goal was. 

I've consolidated since then and only hold 6 coins right now, but my main source of information is the internet. I'll start off on reddit or youtube and I listen to what people have to say and from there I take it into my own hands. I read any articles I can find to see what progress each team is making and how practical or likely it is that they actually reach their end goal and what the chances of adoption are. 

The emotions that come from market fluctuation are very real. There are times when a coin I own pumps and I feel vindicated and want to put my whole life savings in it and there are times when a coin dumps and I start to doubt all of my research. But at the end of the day if you put the time into understanding this space and what you're investing in, you should be confident in your investments. With how I believe this space will evolve over the next decade, even if only two of my coins succeed, it should cancel out all the losses from my other investments. I hold for the long term and try not to worry about short term fluctuation. I was lucky enough to make good money by investing before the bull run towards the end of 2017, but lost a lot during the bear market. I just kept DCAing and now with the resurgence of the market, I've slowly started climbing back into the positive. But with me knowing that I was holding for the longterm, I never really stressed about the short term losses (and with a long term investment, even 1-2 years can be seen as the short term). 

Hope that helped and good luck to you.",fihczkr,2020-02-23 07:02:28,5

The only way out I am seeing is if the BCH power players give into Amaury's extortionate demand and fund ABC out of pocket. The BCH power players are going to lose a hell of a lot more from a chainsplit than they are from funding ABC.

Rant (I have to say this every time because there's always ""that guy"" who yammers about ""you just want it for free""):

Internet advertising often contains malware and malicious redirects. Even YouTube ads have been known to contain bitcoin miners. No ad can be considered safe. You should use ad blockers and Google cache to avoid internet ads. THIS IS NOT THEFT. This is reasonable and prudent action you should take to keep your devices safe. 

Content creators will not try to protect you from the ads they serve. They claim they can't, but that's only because they don't want to try. They (and their shills!) will at the same time *expect* you to compromise your security for their dollar. That *is* unreasonable and you should *not* accept it. Use an ad blocker like ublock origin and adblock plus, and never whitelist a site (even to support the content creators) unless you absolutely must in order to use its functionality and are locked in to that specific site.

Again, ad blockers are not theft. Neither is using Google cache. Hacking is a crime, though, and if we aren't going to hold content creators responsible for the damage malicious code in the ads they serve can do, we owe it to ourselves to prevent it in any way we can.",fiinqwh,2020-02-23 11:07:59,6

recycled_ideas,"Yes, depending on the bank, and the amount of money, and the jurisdiction anyway.

It's kind of hard to store large quantities of money onshore though, and storing money in a tax haven is pretty difficult for an average person, which means that these enterprises tend to work in cash or sometimes bitcoin.

Now the problem you've got is that you've got money, but if you spend any of it on anything big someone is going to ask you where you got it from.

So you need a way to earn money that appears legit. That you can pay taxes on, and show to any inconvenient federal or state investigators.

Traditionally this was done with low yield cash only businesses with limited paper trail. Laundromats were a favourite because so long as you make sure you actually use an appropriate amount of water and electricity there's nothing tying the money to a particular customer.

You then have a business income that you can declare and pay taxes on and most importantly spend.

In the modern electronic world, this is a bit more difficult and Kickstarter probably actually has enough protections in place that it might be too difficult to actually do, but that's the general principle.

You take money you earned in a way you can't admit and convert it to the proceeds of a ""legitimate"" business.",fik4rkz,2020-02-24 00:45:32,1
Amichateur,"&gt;But here is why I think Bitcoin has another flaw

So why?

&gt;long term it will get harder to get people interested in it, always at the start there are the people who flood in but getting more in constantly gets a lot harder.

Still waiting for the ""Why""...

&gt;As I’ve said value in Bitcoin isn’t difficult to understand you can say what it can do but the question always is is it doing those things on a level that makes it certain to succeed and IMO it’s not.

Still waiting for the ""Why""...         (expressing a belief or opinion w/o reason is not ""why"" but ""what"" - it is religion.)

&gt;Also I believe

Still waiting for the ""Why""...         
(a belief is not an explanation for a belief)

&gt;from the past based on speculation Bitcoin is an echo bubble economy

oh a new word....

&gt; driven mainly by large wallet holders and not utility or new members,

... you believe...

&gt;and sure the prices will rise, sure we will have FOMO, sure people will get rich as long as they have enough BTC but the market will go repeating price collapses and for a currency to work it has to have faith and the more price bubbles and collapses occur the less likely new people will enter.

So you ""think"" Bitcoin has another flaw ""because"" you have various ""beliefs"". Sorry, but this is ""not convincing"" to put it moderately.

As long as you don't realize it, you are the one lying to yourself. You should think pragmatically and leave your ideologies alone.

Hint: Bitcoin has continuously become less and less volatile, and this trend is going to continue. You seem to have missed that, too. But your ""beliefs"" are too strong I guess.

&gt;You show me an economy that runs without debt

Most economies until 19th century. Long time civilized mankind used gold based, not debt based, currencies.

Plus the micro-economy in the ""Wunder von Wörgl"" in Austria that worked well before it was declared illegal by the bank and debt based system.

&gt;in fact you show me a person who has no debt.

I know many individuals without any debt, incl. myself. And I never had. And I am not from a rich family at all. I am very surprised about your question. You really have a very biased, ideologically backward directed and clised view of reality.

&gt;This is one of the biggest jokes about Bitcoin people blame banks and the system but forget no system is perfect

How is irrational behaviour of some people a proof that Bitcoin cannot work? You are completely illogical and mix everything together!

&gt; and they forget they also have debt otherwise they wouldn’t be trying to get rich quick with Bitcoin.

Again completely wrong, see above.

So all you have proven here - and this very convincingly - is just how baseless all of your points are. Thanks for this eye-opening comment!

&gt;So yes I think a deflationary society would lead to a dystopian society.

Why ""So""? ""So"" is what you say after having given an argument. You did not. You just expressed your baseless beliefs, one after another. Do not think you get away with this cheap trick - not all people here are that stupid.",fik5m3z,2020-02-24 00:54:53,1

errr.... how is this any different to being 'printed out of thin air'?! Almost no work went into the mining process and nobody had a chance to join. Do you actually think your argument is effective, or disproves my point?! LOL

Miners, like any other business sell a product or service (in this case securing the network) and use their profits to continue their business. You don't seem to understand basic economics.

Ripple just continues to dump their bags of useless trash that they printed out of thin air to continue the scam, with the end goal of cashing out all of their useless XRP tokens that they printed out of thin air.

Mark_Bear,"Technically, this sentence is not correct:  

&gt;After [the halving event](https://cryptopress.news/returns-on-bitcoin-may-be-100-in-2020-without-considering-halving/), Bitcoin is going to witness a 50% reduction in supply.

They worded it more accurately in the following paragraph:  

&gt;...the [May halving](https://cryptopress.news/bitcoin-halving-will-it-save-prices-in-2020/) would reduce annual supply inflation from a rate of 3.7% to 1.8%.

&amp;#x200B;

Be careful.  The ""supply"" of Bitcoins could mean the total number of Bitcoins mined at this point in time.  The ""supply"" could also be used in the context of ""supply and demand"" where supply refers to Bitcoins that people are wishing to sell at that point in time.  

Then we have the **rate at which new Bitcoins are being mined**, on average.  This ***rate*** is a number of Bitcoins per unit of time.  This ***rate*** is going to be cut in half.  Not the ""supply"" nor the ""supply"" -- the rate.

queenofmoons,"Well, Freecloud is officially the Crypto-Libertarian Pseudorepublic of Freecloud, and so I think can be firmly assumed to be outside of Earth's fully automated luxury space communism system, and that people there can spend whatever they like, assuming someone else will take it. 

The whole money/no money thing is kind of fraught. I like it in the setting because it's a big play that the future is different, and that a major way of conceiving of the world, and the anxieties it creates, is simply absent. But then comes the part where you have to imagine what that actually looks like outside of the confines of a government starship, where money *already* doesn't have much use, you run into the fact that currency is so useful that even the most aggressively centrally planned command economies have always made use of it, and even plans to produce Star Trek-esque social cornucopias, like the work of the Soviet, Nobel Prize-winning economist Leonid Kantorovich, had a role for money and prices. 

Which doesn't mean that heterodox economists haven't envisioned *really weird* currencies- expiring currencies and currencies backed by some prosocial activity or baskets of currencies that are used in different classes of transactions- to try and take advantage of the fact that money itself is deeply weird, being a dimensionless token of collective trust. And it's totally possible that 300 years of work on the subject could get you to a place where whatever weird accounting units are passed around are so peculiar, and so divorced from daily experience, that it seems sensible to say that the Federation, or Earth, or whatever, doesn't use money.

But it's easy to imagine that that doesn't preclude a *person* from having money, and from some people engaging in activities that tend to need it or going places where it is preferred. Kim Stanley Robinson has talked about 'capitalism at the margins', where a utopian economic system would keep the well-being of people and biosphere far from the exploitative grasp of market robber, but if people want to play the capitalism game by betting on asteroid futures or whatever, well, have fun- just don't be expecting that you'll be able to use the proceeds to privatize a health care system or that we won't tax the bejeezus out of you if you start buying up all the hasperat in the Bajor sector and actual sentients are going hungry. Maybe that's just accounted for latinum, fungible across polities for the same reasons gold was, or maybe there is a Federation credit, but a Federation credit is more like a bitcoin than a dollar- that is to say, rare and weird and not useful for very much...

...unless you're outside the cornucopia, like the Fenris Rangers, and expecting to having drawing privileges on the Federation Santa Claus machines is unlikely...

...or if you're a person who just *doesn't like when the world works that way*. Here on Earth, we have people who imagine (threaten?) they're going to live on glorified oil rigs if someone dares to suggest a national health service or some monopoly pruning, and presumably some of those fortunes and adherents of those philosophies found somewhere to fly off to.",fikc945,2020-02-24 02:06:09,1

Gold's position as a safe haven is earned from its value proposition that has stood the test of time for thousands of years and is backed by the laws of the universe.

There is no connection at all between market price and value provided in Bitcoin. It is 99.9% speculation. In fact, all the metrics show that use of Bitcoin has gone down over time. All the margin bucket shops require users to hold Bitcoin as collateral to speculate - this makes the spot market more thinly traded and to some degree props up the price.

nullc,"Nitpickingly, no contract that obligates you to participate in a crime (like defrauding people) is valid. Of course, anyone can sue at any time for any reason-- it doesn't have to be valid to waste a lot of your time and money.  Besides, Craig is already slinging threats that the existence of Bitcoin is something he can and will litigate. Saying nothing won't guarantee safety for Gavin-- though this further highlights the conflict of interests this situation has created: Economically, ""Wright won't sue me if I say nothing"" and ""Wright will pay me to say nothing"" are pretty much equivalent.

In my view, ethical conduct requires that whenever someone makes a public endorsement of something at that moment they also create an implicit obligation to make an equally public and equally effective withdrawal of that endorsement-- and whatever consequences go with doing so-- if the situation or their understanding changes.   If they don't want to deal with the risk that a vexatious @#$@-head might engage in spurious litigation when an endorsement is retracted-- then they must not make the endorsement in the first place!

It might be scary, embarrassing, and frustrating to have to pull an endorsement but thems the breaks.

A couple months back, because Andreas reported getting invited to get see Craigs' proof and that there was an NDA, I wrote him and asked if he would mind sharing it with me-- specifically because I was interested if there was anything in it that might be keeping people like Gavin silent. Andreas responded and said he couldn't discuss it at that time, then followed up a few weeks later pointing to his testimony in the Kleiman case... so apparently that's why he can't comment on it.

babies_eater,"Markets moving so I guess it's time to post again.

Last time I said I'd wait for a long around 9k as it was an area I was expecting support. [(link)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/f6na58/daily_discussion_thursday_february_20_2020/fi8hi8q?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). Clearly we dropped straight through this Area, and then some. I actually pulled my buy orders yesterday because of Corona's effect on traditional markets.

Reasoning:

* Current (infection) numbers don't indicate impact - much less economic impact which will gradually roll-out into the economy.
* Order book liquidity drying up in securities (asked a securities finance colleague), currently the market is risk-off minded. (--&gt; crypto is very risk-on.)
* Move into safe haven doesn't happen immediately. Sure gold is up a bit, but not on par with the rout in the market.
   * Window of opportunity is if/when stimulus packages enter the economy, then store of value assets will flourish.

*Conclusion: This market action will reward the patient trader who avoids catching falling knives, but time moment of increased fiat inflows and/or market confidence restoration.*

TA: Currently I'm eyeing the low 8k's as a point for reversal. (8250-8000) This may take some days/weeks to get there, though being bitcoin we may get there before March. I think the current drop is fear selling being bought up by Market making algos, though without a rally they will abandon ship when we roll over for another leg down.

Tricky_Troll,"I’d just like to share something I posted in response to a comment further down this thread. It’s my thoughts about current price action in response to someone with a bearish outlook and a little advice for any newcomers and some general advice. Also, I know my writing isn’t as articulate as others in this sub like DC but here goes anyway:

I’m not totally convinced. Now don’t get me wrong, I see where you’re coming from and like your reasoning here but for me there’s just one major issue for me which makes me skeptical of this. I’m talking about the halvening/ETH 2.0 🥓 chain launch. Now many people might say “the halvening is priced in” whatever the 🐬 that means. But I disagree. The halvening changes the fundamental supply and demand of bitcoin. With equal demand and half the supply of freshly mined (and usually immediately sold) bitcoin means that the price must go up in response. Now sure, the price may rise before the halvening due to hype making the resulting pump from a supply and demand shift less significant since it was already “priced in” (I assume that’s what people mean by that). But the price hasn’t doubled in the 6 months going up to the halvening and that’s what’ll be needed to offset the change in supply and demand when it comes. So expecting the price to drop before then is a bit crazy IMO. 

*Side note: Many people say that if the price of BTC is below X when the halvening kicks in then miners will stop mining because they are unprofitable and the chain will die in a death spiral as miners cant mine profitably so they stop mining/sell bitcoin to offset costs resulting in a further price drop and so on. This is 🐮💩 as the mining difficulty will adjust and there will always be someone who has super cheap power (I was mining ETH for free for a while in my university dorm since we didn’t pay for power!)*

On top of the bitcoin halvening price action, I think that ETH’s ratio gains will continue as 🥓chain and 🥩ing is on the horizon. Especially considering it will come shortly after the halvening, I think we’ll be stealing some of bitcoin’s thunder.

Now this is not to say that I think the price can only go up. Quite the opposite, short to mid term price movement will continue to be an enigma which nobody can accurately predict. However, I do think that macro trends can be predicted with a reasonable level of accuracy. Just don’t get caught up in the day to day or the week to week. Whether you blame this pullback on Coronavirus/traditional market fears or if you put it down to crypto just doing crypto (my money is on the second one), I think the best thing anyone can do (**especially new comers**) is to look at the fundamentals of a project, buy into the best ones and hold long term. Don’t trade, you may think you’ll be good at it but trust me you won’t. You’ll lose money trading unless you have years of experience (unless you’re trading big macro movements such as selling BTC back near 14k on its way to 20k and not FOMOing back in when you see it go up another 50% because you’re not buying back in for a year or longer. But in this case you need balls of steel). Don’t use leverage. HODL your own keys, don’t use an exchange. I feel like anyone who does this will be sitting pretty 10 years from now.

Sorry this kind of deviated off of what I was replying to but I’ve been wanting to say this for a while now since we have had some newcomers arriving and the bull hype is returning.",fiv3cxj,2020-02-27 06:38:02,14

satoshiwins,"Some people had originally convinced Satoshi to put a temporary cap in the early days to avoid flooding attacks. Flood attacks were more risky at that time because Bitcoins had a very small value. Now that the value of coins is greater, economics will prevent flood attacks without the need for a cap.  Bitcoin is all about economic security.  Satoshi always said the cap would eventually be lifted and block increases would be phased in.  But some people overtook the protocol and disallowed the increase.  Greg Maxwell of BlockStream Core was the sole person to veto the increase, he had a lot of power at the time.  We don't know if he was working for some government agency or oligarch bankers to destroy Bitcoin or what. They pushed the narrative that by having small blocks it makes Bitcoin ""more decentralized"" which is basically a bunch of BS. Having small blocks introduces developer central planners and is anything but decentralized.  Small blockers say they want the blocks small so they can all run their node, which they think gives them some sort of power over the system, but in reality its complete brainwashing.  Satoshi himself said [it would be silly for users to run nodes and nodes should be run in giant server farms as the system scales.](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=532.msg6269#msg6269):

&gt; The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.

NilacTheGrim,"Release Notes for Bitcoin Cash Node version 0.21.0
==================================================

Bitcoin Cash Node version 0.21.0 is now available from:

  - &lt;https://bitcoincashnode.org&gt;
  - &lt;https://github.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/releases/tag/v0.21.0&gt;

This is the first release of Bitcoin Cash Node as a drop-in replacement for Bitcoin ABC 0.21.0. It is based on Bitcoin ABC 0.21.0, with minimal changes necessary to disable the Infrastructure Funding Proposal (IFP) soft forks. For exchanges and users, this client will follow the longest chain whether it includes IFP soft forks or not. For miners, running this client ensures the `getblocktemplate` RPC call will return a block with version bits that vote ""NO"" for the IFP soft forks. Additionally, unlike Bitcoin ABC, `getblocktemplate` will *not* automatically insert IFP white-list addresses into the coinbase transaction.

Minimal changes from Bitcoin ABC 0.21.0 to Bitcoin Cash Node 0.21.0:

 - All *IFP soft fork logic*, signaling logic and the *hard-coded whitelist* have been **removed**.
 - Rebranding from Bitcoin ABC -&gt; Bitcoin Cash Node.
 - Qt GUI settings are automatically copied from Bitcoin ABC (on first use of Bitcoin Cash Node).

_Note regarding BIP9 and `getblockchaininfo` (below): BIP9 is inactive due to no available proposals to vote on and it may be removed in a future release._

----

All other upgrade changes from ABC 0.21.0 are untouched and included below for reference.

----

## This release includes the following features and fixes:

- The RPC `getrpcinfo` returns runtime details of the RPC server.
At the moment it returns the active commands and the corresponding execution time.
- `ischange` field of boolean type that shows if an address was used for change output was added to `getaddressinfo` method response.
- Bump automatic replay protection to Nov 2020 upgrade.
- Re-introduction of BIP9, info available from the `getblockchaininfo` RPC.
- Various bug fixes and stability improvements.

New RPC methods
---------------
  - `getnodeaddresses` returns peer addresses known to this node.
  It may be used to connect to nodes over TCP without using the DNS seeds.

Network upgrade
---------------
At the MTP time of 1589544000 (May 15, 2020 12:00:00 UTC) the following behaviors will change:
  - The default for max number of in-pool ancestors (`-limitancestorcount`) is changed from 25 to 50.
  - The default for max number of in-pool descendants (`-limitdescendantcount`) is changed from 25 to 50.
  - OP_REVERSEBYTES support in script.
  - New SigOps counting method (SigChecks) as standardness and consensus rules.

Usage recommendations
---------------------

We recommend Bitcoin Cash Node 0.21.0 as a drop-in replacement for ABC 0.21.0.

Regressions
-----------

Bitcoin Cash Node 0.21.0 does not introduce any known regressions compared to ABC 0.21.0.",fixwbae,2020-02-28 03:22:48,8

CanWeTalkEth,"I have never heard that Bitcoiners are running their own nodes more frequently than Ethereum chainers, and often that Bitcoin is far more centralized.

Also, I don't follow the logic that users running nodes means *anything* really. I like the idea that ""investors"" or ""users"" should have a say in how things progress, because of course if no one uses the software then who cares what it does, but in the end if the actual programmers writing the clients and the researchers determining the logic of the blockchain mechanics are really determining how Ethereum *works*.

TL;DR If you only run a node, you're a nobody. If you participate in the community and put your money where your mouth is, you stand a chance of having your voice heard.",fiypi34,2020-02-28 07:54:35,8
Corp-Por,"1/ This report, which is specifically about 2019, came a bit late, we're over 15% done with 2020 already. How come?

Does this mean there will be a 2020 Marketing Proposal forthcoming?

Anyway, glad to see this report, there's some good and some not-so-good in it, in my humble opinion.  Excuse my verbosity in advance, but I have to go through many points here.

I'll start with the good: there's a healthy dose of self-criticism, an awareness that not all plans turned out as expected, and there's an open admission. That's a good start, I think, a sign that things could perhaps improve.

But then there's plenty of things that worry me as well, starting with how 785k(!) can be spent out of a 490k budget (the disparity!) -  Anyways, it seems that storytelling is important to you, and I think your post tries to tell a story.  Stories, memes, are a big part of crypto, as you note in your post, but we must never mistake them for the fundamental, the base reality as it were, that is the confluence between technology and economy that creates this new phenomenon known as *digital scarcity.* That is why we're here. Or at least why I'm here.

&gt;Bitcoin gamified time-stamping. Decred gamified decision-making and formed a digital collective, a technology-enabled experiment in human organization.

I think we should be careful to make such a distinction, because it can make it seem as if DCR something completely different from bitcoin, something like an *appcoin for organizing labor*, as if that was its primary function. The primary substance of DCR *is still precisely* that ""gamified timestamping"" you attribute to BTC!  The labor-organizing stuff is all *to support the primary function*, which is not different from BTC's. This should be stressed. If I was a prospective investor and read a statement like: ""BTC is a store of value, DCR is a social experiment in organization and decision-making..."" which one of the two do you reckon I'd be inclined to invest in?

We need to be careful to always present those *secondary* features as supporting the *primary*. We should never forget that without that primary base: of ""bitcoin"", of a store-of-value, the whole structure is meaningless and would fall apart in a second.  (Almost) nobody would invest in this if it were only a ""social experiment in labor organization"".  

Example: saying that that DCR's primary function is the ""being paid by the blockchain"" would be like saying that the raison d'etre for a State are the taxes and the public employees. But that would be completely in reverse: the whole point is the citizen and their freedoms, and the public sector is only there to serve the tax-paying private citizen!

Here's further proof: Imagine if we remove all the ""social experiment"" stuff you love about DCR, what are we left with? Something like bitcoin, something still very useful and extremely valuable. But now try to imagine if you take away the ""store-of-value"" aspect from DCR, and leave all the rest: what is left?  A purposeless kickstarter, or I don't know what.  Something like the now defunct Devcoin, a coin only some of us oldtimers will remember.  So it's clear that all that stuff is secondary, and it serves only to add to DCR's store-of-value proposition.  Without that, it's nothing.  Nobody would ever invest in it, perhaps a bored philanthropist or two.    

---

&gt; TL;DR Positives &amp; Negatives

A problematic aspect of this part of the post is that it attributes all the failings and successes to this amorphous ""decred"" entity, as if it had its own agency. So you say: ""Decred poorly coordinated multiple efforts..."" - you attribute it to ""decred"", this ""entity"", and not to any specific group or individual(s).

In no part of the blog post do you ever attribute any ""negatives"" to a specific group, or to yourself, for instance. Not saying you should blame yourself: but if everyone who works for DCR and got money to do X, has always the ability to say ""decred has failed to do X"", there will be no personal responsibility. E.g. I get a budget of 400K to manage from Pi... it doesn't go well... I then say ""decred has failed to do X, Y, Z"". Sure, we can say that I guess... but there are also roles, there are moneys that were distributed to various people to oversee certain sectors, so there must be also some personal responsibility, it's not good enough to attribute the failings to ""decred"".  

It goes without saying that you could also attribute some successes to yourself and to the marketing team.  The ""DAO"" meme is nice and all, but in reality, this is still people doing things and some people have more responsibility than other people.  Nobody here really reinvented the wheel of labor.

Which brings me to the next point, you write:

&gt; Some contractors dramatically out deliver their costs, while others have done the opposite.

You mention certain contractors did not do their part. Can you elaborate on this? Were they billing for work that wasn’t done? Were they lying? What kind of action was taken? Have such individuals been removed from the project? Perhaps there needs to be an audit of who does what?

&gt; Events spending = 335K USD

Having proposals for individual continents - so you want an Asia prop, an Africa prop etc? Is handing off large sums of money to a few individuals to hold a few events in parts of the world we have no oversight on? How do we know these things help grow the project? Don’t you think something like this could spiral out of hand quickly?


As we see here with some people who billed a lot without working, and the website being late: the blockchain doesn't automagically solve issues related to labor in general. The hierarchies do not magically disappear ""because blockchain"".  People still need to be told: ""hey, you're late..."" or ""hey, you're billing but not doing much"" - which means a 'line of command' is still required.  Maybe with programmers it isn't, but ""marketing"" is not something people do out of passion, for the most part.",fiysakv,2020-02-28 08:23:37,4
jgun83,"Very important little bump before the daily close, so that it closed above yesterday's price and also straddling the 200MA. 

With everyone expecting blood in the streets tomorrow in traditional markets, we're getting close to the point where too many people are too bearish and things will start to show signs of a bottom, especially if we get coordinated rate cuts globally. Stabilizing the financial markets will put the halving narrative back front and center for bitcoin and I suspect we'll retake 10k fairly quickly.",fiywgxp,2020-02-28 09:08:55,10

diydude2,"Stonks got walloped again today, and bonds aren't looking all that hot either.  Bitcoin was up a bit.  Nothing to write home about but a win is a win.

Hypothetically, what do you all think would happen if Bitcoin went up or held its own while stocks, bonds, real estate and everything else tanks even as the cost of living goes up in real, everyday ways due to supply chain issues?  Think beyond markets.  Yes, a few more days like this will probably send  Bitcoin soaring because as we all know, it doesn't take much money in relative terms to cause a BGD.  Last April's 20% BGD happened due to one lousy $100 million spot buy.  How much money do you think will flow out of the multi-trillion-dollar stock market into the measly Bitcoin market?

This isn't about pyrrhic victory.  I'm not happy about the misery and poverty that will occur, but it's not Bitcoin's fault.  Bitcoin will be OK.  Most of us on this sub will not suffer the same poverty as many, many others.  Remember to be a gracious winner.  Be kind and use your coming windfall to help others and help the world dig out of the mess it's about to be in.  Hookers and blow get boring real fast.

PatrickBitmain,"Proof of work was supposed to have honest home miners using their home computer that could offset their power consumption by reducing their home heating, not mining farms that consume massive amounts of energy that can't be offset.

Because bitcoiners and mining farms have strayed far far far from the original concept in pursuit of their anarchist dreams and/or desire to get rich they have created an unsustainable paradigm.

They can't scale using mining farms as the power consumption they require becomes unavailable. They can't move to clean cheap renewable energy because the mining cost depends strongly on burning scarce fossil fuels.

They can't find enough liquidity because most people in the world aren't that stupid or don't have money even to buy one share in a company.

As for security, all Bitmain has to do is use more of their own miners and acquire a bigger percentate of the hash rate. They can then completely rob everyone. It's not in their interest to do that at the moment because they are making money selling mining machines to stupid greedy American miners. They don't need to sell 'all' their mining rewards either because they are subsidized from the Chinese government as are provincial Chinese mining farms. 

IF it was possible for bitcoin to 'moon' to many tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars then it would make sense for the Chinese government and Bitmain to grab more control of the blockchain. At these prices the stupid greedy American miners wouldn't be able to afford the mining machines. Bitmain would take over the chains (BTC, BCH, LTC and ETH) and all the hodlers worldwide would be begging on their knees and praying to their god the Chinese dictatorship and the puppets Jihan Wu and Changpeng Zhao.",fj3o5ca,2020-03-01 00:11:59,1

Su85s,"im with you on this one to an extent.  if shes been bailing you out or youve been having difficulty keeping up with shared expenses like rent or bills then she may be right to need more information from you.  if you two have financial goals for the future or are considering marriage then she has a right at least to the information about your financial situation.
when it comes to gambling, its something that people see differently.  i used to work as a card dealer.  some people can be responsible with it and others will drop their rent, then go take out a loan trying to win it all back.  some people dont understand how it is a form of entertainment and that not everyone is a degenerate.  how has your history with gambling affected your relationship?  did you need to borrow money to cover losses?  did you make attempts to get back previous losses by risking more than you could afford?  if your relationship was exposed to this type of thing you may need to show to her that your not half an hour at a card table away from pissing out thousands of dollars.
i also think that your hesitation alludes to the fact that she may see activity she does not agree with or that you have more than she would expect and you do not trust her with.  ill spare you my opinion on the bitcoin investing but if she doesnt agree with it youre going to have problems when she sees more than she thinks is reasonable.  consider opening a few extra accounts if you think she has an unreasonable interest in your finances, but also be aware that money troubles break relationships more often than anything else.  hope this helps you understand things a little better.",fj3pku1,2020-03-01 00:29:15,1

bitusher,"Bitcoin is far more than a store of value but also a smart contract ledger, timestamping ledger,. payment rail, and peer to peer currency . 

These are some of the benefits

1) **Save money** - I like to save 15-20% off amazon, and use other services like 5% off pizza, and 2% off gift cards and more with Bitcoin 

2) **Digital Gold** - Bitcoin is very desirable and scarce and since it is an uncorrelated asset class your portfolio is better hedged to be a safer way of finding alpha

3) **Timestamping** - Tweetstamp, and opentimestamps are useful timestamping tools 

4) **Insurance** - If my bank account or credit cards get lost or stolen or account is frozen Bitcoin is a great alternative to store value

5) **Censorship Resistance**- I can make donations to organizations like defense distributed or wikileaks even if their payment processors and banks are shutoff due to unethical political pressure

6) **Soverignty** - As a Business I can accept value even if I am deplatformed or banned from banking 

7) **Micro txs** microtxs are simply not possible with fiat , where I  can do so with my BTC lightning wallet

8) **Security** SSS and multisig with CLTV and other scripts allow for novel methods to secure ones wealth

9) **Privacy** with electronic fiat I have no privacy unlike with Bitcoin transactions where I am given a choice between privacy or transparency with each wallet

10) **Global** I can travel the world , rent hotels and buy plane tickets and withdraw local currency easily without fears of credit card fraud. I can send payments to employees in foreign countries easily",fj3sfvk,2020-03-01 01:02:10,1

I believe that nano will survive regardless due to its fundamentals but I think nano has neglected the business side of things. Don't they network with industry leaders? Don't they care about PR?

He predicted a us housing bubble burst in 2012. It never happened.

Let the little guys sell at a loss and they'll gladly swoop in and buy. The Corona  virus issue is real, but there's also a lot of market strategies in play. Bitcoin is an alternative to that system and it's gained a global perspective that is far more positive that it was 5 years ago. It's not where it can be, but it's getting there. A decentralized global transaction system and highly secure storage network with a fixed unit supply that does not reflect a single company's performance can continue to look more attractive the longer it continues to exist.

If you ignore the CSW drama and look at BSV as a protocol, can you not see this is the Bitcoin we all signed up for? It literally is the white paper. It is exploding with innovation, and rightly so. Every time BSV makes a step forward the cognitive dissonance seems to clamp down harder. Absolutely astounding :)

Where we differ is by the time the fork war started (that ended up in the BSV split) I was already informed enough to know that CSW is no doubt Satoshi. You can scoff at that, but it only shows how mislead you are, as are most. The disinformation campaign is completely nuts. If you can come to terms with that maybe you can continue your success with BSV.

2 months ago Pomp said DeFi is going to be built on Bitcoin and Ethereum is going to fade away. [This is the comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/eexbfa/daily_general_discussion_december_24_2019/fby0flu/) where I decided to do something about it.

Today Pomp said [ETH is just a poor man's fiat](https://twitter.com/RyanSAdams/status/1234573585685123078?s=20). He's entitled to his opinion. But we deserve better than Bitcoin maximalism in our crypto media.

bitvote,"A few quick thoughts:

1. I've closed 80% of my pre-halving long. I had entered a short-term position in late 2019 / first weeks of 2020. But given the virus and my sense that any pre-halving bump already happened, I've mostly closed out the position. 

2. An outlier scenario to consider
Part i: What if the impact of the halving is more powerful than many might have believed? Such that even though bitcoin might - in the absence of the halving - tend to go down, that with the halving factored in it moves up. 
Part ii: If this upward movement happens in the middle of a global meltdown, we could see an opportunity for bitcoin to go on a bull run during a major macroeconomic downturn. 
I don't believe this is likely as I think bitcoin is very much a risk on asset. But if the halving can give us a 30-50% run _while_ the rest of the world is melting, it could be a beautiful thing for bitcoin.",fjbf1we,2020-03-03 08:30:53,5

The vast majority of Bitcoin BCH transactions come from independent merchants, accepting in it in a P2P fashion as intended. Though this is a trend we have only seen on BCH, not on any other coins. This clearly comes down to business owners not seeing any value in coins like BTC, LN, LTC, they do not want to keep this shit because of high fees, unreliability and an overall poor user experience, nor are there many places available for them to use these coins at. They want to offload it immediately, and that's why they all embrace payment processors.

BCH on the other hand, particularly in North Queensland, we have managed to ""close the loop"" and have established a BCH economy. Where merchants who accept BCH are using their BCH to pay other businesses that accept BCH.

BruceInc,"Every computer has a CPU (Central Processing Unit). This is a chip that is often referred to as the “brain” of the computer. It is responsible for doing all the calculations and running all the necessary bits and pieces that make a computer work. Some of the higher end PC and laptops have what’s also called a GPU (graphics processing unit) often referred to as a graphics card. These are specifically designed to handle large loads of graphical information and are typically used for playing high resolution video games, running very resource-heavy programs (like video or photo editing software). 

In very simple terms, crypto currency work like a very very very long math problem, when you solve that problem you are rewarded with a token sometimes called a “coin” (Bitcoin, etherium, litecoin, monero are all example of these coins). This whole process of solving the math problem for a reward is called “mining”. These math problems require a lot of computing power to solve, so some people like myself build specialty computers called “mining rigs” that have multiple GPU installed in them, we then use the computing power of these combined GPU in these rigs to run the math problems in order to collect the coin rewards. 

My question was if it was possible to use this computing power of my mining rigs to help with running the very complex models that are required for scientific research. This modeling process is called “Folding”

G_Porgie,"I find Bitcoin culture to be very similar to Detaxer culture (Freemen-on-the-land, Sovereign Citizens, Moors, etc.). The true believers that live within the culture are convinced that it is much bigger than it really is, that it is novel, that there are huge, intricate government conspiracies to hold its people back, and that they, the true believers, are the smartest guys on the planet and will soon rule the world (just as soon as the rest of the world ""gets it""). The Venn diagram of Detaxer beliefs and Coiner beliefs is pretty close to a perfect circle.

Then there are the small number of people who frequent subs like /r/amibeingdetained and /r/buttcoin. Many of us are just people who have a weird affinity to the bizarre and come to watch the monkeys dance, while others see the potential damage that these cultures can cause - particularly to vulnerable people who may be easily swayed by promises of work-free  wealth,  life without taxes, and freedom from evil governments and bankers. In that latter case, there are a growing number of people who are hoping to expose the dangers of these cultures to try to limit the damage that they cause.

The reality is, though, that between the true believers and the passionate detractors, the entire ecosystem is insignificant in the real world. Outside of a few news articles about the price of this ""Bitcoin thing"" and ""the Bundy standoff,"" most people are unaware and completely unaffected by what goes on in those cultures. Now, people in the legal community have to occasionally deal with Detaxers, and people in the financial community often have to deal with coiners, however most of the time, the ""deal with"" involves a deep sigh and eyeroll, and then a whole bunch of paperwork.

ThomasZander,"Thank you Freetrader!

I'm Tom Zander. Long time coiner and blockchain developers. Founder of the Flowee project which aims to work on infrastructure and has as its goal to help us transition to a Bitcoin Cash Economy. 

I have worked with Freetrader for various years and was happy to hear he wanted to be the lead on the Bitcoin Cash Node. He has my support, and I work with the team on anything I can do to help the project and indirectly Bitcoin Cash.

It is my strong belief that Bitcoin Cash is going to be huge and the idea that the different teams need to fight in order to get their fair share never felt right with me. The pie is sufficiently large for everyone, and then some! So I'm not switching team, I'm helping the BCH-Node guys because that helps Bitcoin Cash, which helps everyone.

ThomasZander,"&gt; Are you concerned that, it's just a matter of time, till we see another divide? 

The power of money comes from the network effect. There are literally unlimited types of money, the ones that most people use will end up being the strongest.

Bitcoin Cash, and most of crypto, is currently quite small. The amount of people you need to convince is small if you want to diverge from the path, to become something different than they bought it for. But, as time goes on there will be more and more people that need to be convinced to change and add something like the IFP.

The main way to combat the problem of splits is to get more economic activity on Bitcoin Cash. Not just miners, not just investors. Whole economies can work with only Bitcoin Cash as their means of exchange.

This is why the majority of the backers of the mining backer IFP have withdrawn their support, first Roger Ver, then Jiang Zhuoer.

We do not need to _convince_ 100% of miners to run BCHN to prevent a split. The miners do not WANT a split! The chances of the IFP activation not leading to a split are zero - therefore miners are reacting, and the IFP is been dropped. This is actually good for chain security.

each bitcoin is a solution to a math problem, the first ones are easy to solve, and as more solutions are found, the next one gets harder to find. 

mining bitcoin just involves computers trying to solve the math problem.",fjoip6d,2020-03-07 06:02:16,6
haplo0,"Bitcoin works by blockchain consensus.  Essentially, the blockchain network presents a very hard math problem -- one where it's really really hard to figure out the answer, but if you have the answer it's trivial to verify that it's the correct answer.  The math problem has to do with factoring very large numbers.

When bitcoin started, you could use a normal computer processor (CPU) to do this math.  It might take you a few minutes to figure out the answer or it might take you days and days and days.  Whoever figures the answer out first ""wins"" the reward, which started at 50 bitcoins.

The network automatically adjusts the difficulty of the math problem according to how many people are trying to figure it out and how much computing power they are throwing at the problem.  The network is designed to try and keep it so that someone in the world will figure out the answer after 10 minutes, and then there is a new math problem that takes another 10 minutes, over and over every 10 minutes somebody ""wins"" by figuring out the solution to the math problems and gets the 50 bitcoins.  So if bitcoin gets more popular and more people are using more computers to try and solve the problem, such that the answer is figured out in less than 10 minutes, the difficult gets harder.  If it takes too long for people to figure out the answer, then the difficulty gets easier, to try and keep it at one ""winner"" every 10 minutes.

Because bitcoins has been around for a decade now and is very popular, such that millions of people are trying to win the prize, the difficulty has continued to go up over time.  After a couple years of bitcoin existing, people started using GPUs (graphical processing units, like on a video card) instead of CPUs.  That's because GPUs are better at solving the kind of math problem that bitcoin is based on.  CPUs are more generalized at doing all kinds of math, but GPUs are better at the kind of math that you need to solve the bitcoin puzzle and win the prize.  Then after a few more years, people started building custom hardware, called ASICs, that were even more efficient.  Now it is basically impossible to mine bitcoin with a CPU or a GPU, you need a custom ASIC in order to have a chance.  That's because there are people who have invested millions of dollars buying thousands of ASIC devices and running them in countries where electricity is extremely cheap, and it's very very difficult to compete with large scale farms like that.

They also came up with mining ""pools"", where a lot of people could join together and try to solve the puzzle together, and share the reward if they won.  This way, you don't have to win the entire 50 bitcoin prize by yourself, which could take months or even years, instead you and a hundred other friends could join together and maybe you solve it in a couple weeks instead, and then you split the reward.

By the way, the mining reward is cut in half every few years, that has already happened twice, so it went from 50 bitcoins to 25, to now where it is 12.5 bitcoins if you solve the puzzle.

So between the reward halving, and the mining pools, and the custom ASIC bitcoin farms, if you want to mine bitcoin by yourself now you can but you'll probably earn something like 0.000001 bitcoins per day -- something very very small.  The best way to get bitcoin now is to just buy some bitcoin fractions that already exist from someone else, not to mine it yourself.",fjojckk,2020-03-07 06:08:32,3
tbenz9,"Yikes, I'm normally a Sia cheerleader but this article doesn't sit very well with me.  There is way, way too much speculation, corners cut, and assumptions written in this post to make it reputable or reliable (in my opinion).

I'm certainly no expert on the topic, but I've managed hundreds of petabytes of storage in enterprise environments and can tell you in my experience you missed the mark here.

It seems your post suggests host centralization (or at least datacenter centralization), I don't believe that's the goal of Sia and it goes against the decentralization ethos.  Having 24/7 staff, thousands of HDDs, megawatts of power, and millions of dollars to invest in storage is not something the average user will have.  Only a relatively small number of organizations will invest in something like that.  

No one running thousands of hard drives is going to keep them on a shelf.  When you've got thousands of HDDS running vibration becomes an issue, as does spin-up power consumption, heat management, etc.  Every petabyte scale filesystem I've managed has dozens or hundreds of HDDs attached to a controller via a SAS expander or equivalent system.  This enabled the relatively small number of controllers to stagger the spin-up of hard drives preventing power spikes, it also makes monitoring easy, management easier, etc.

You also don't cover the enterprise vs consumer supply chain.  It's physically impossible to buy thousands of consumer grade HDDs for a project, just ask Backblaze.  The HDD manufacturers force you into the enterprise class if you want to buy by the pallet.  Enterprise drives are MUCH more expensive than consumer drives, and if you're running thousands of drives you're going to want the enterprise version anyways.  In my experience it costs around $1000/TB for an enterprise class filesystem, which is the only way you're going to be able to scale to hundreds of petabytes in a single datacenter (again look at Backblaze's migration to enterprise HDDs and management hardware).

I believe you are drastically underestimating the cost of bandwidth and utilities this would require.  If you're running petabytes of Sia storage out of a single datacenter you're going to be consuming a lot of power and bandwidth, you'll need peering agreements with multiple ISPs, dedicated fiber, redundant ISPs, etc, again, this costs money, lots of it.

I have seen the Bitcoin datacenters and their extreme cost-cutting techniques, I don't believe that is a healthy direction to be going, and I hope Sia doesn't end up in facilities like that (centralized, poor infrastructure, dangerous, community nuisances).

I do believe Sia will maintain extremely affordable storage prices, but I don't believe it's for the reasons you mentioned.  I believe the **storage marketplace** will continue to drive prices down and keep them low.  Host **de**centralization causing competition among hosts, will keep rices low (this seems to be the opposite of what your blog post is suggesting).  A subset of Sia hosts will always be willing to sell storage at a loss to recoup their capital expenditures, and as the Sia storage utilization grows, so will the number of users selling their excess storage below market prices.

Either way Sia has a bright future and I'm excited to be a part of it.",fjon1eq,2020-03-07 06:44:25,6

Taek42,"I definitely believe that Sia datacenters will end up in the direction of mining farms. We can only enforce so many things at the protocol level, and everywhere that we can't enforce is a corner that cheap datacenters can cut.

As it were, I believe that the advantages to corner cutting are so significant that it should largely be encouraged. I disagree with you that Bitcoin mining went in a sorry direction, I think it's actually quite brilliant and ultimately the mining farms have been able to cut total waste by spending fewer resources on making things efficient. It doesn't make sense to pay $10,000 to make your home have $30 less per year in electricity bills, same applies at the datacenter level.

I do believe issues like vibration and spin-up power can be solved using shoestring techniques - it doesn't need to be pretty, it just needs to work. And it doesn't even need to work well, it just needs to maintain 95% uptime on a per-sector basis. Some of these things, like spin-up, should be solvable at a software level as well, which scales much better than custom physical controllers. Remember, we aren't talking about the Sia network in 2021, we're talking about what it might look like after 10 more years of growth and iteration.

Regardless, this certainly isn't a pitch telling people to go out and build shoestring datacenters right now. The free market will figure out the best way to make things happen, and open competition is the true strength of the Sia network.

HIS RESPONSE//
We emailed Krugman for a comment on the quote and here's his explanation:

Well, two things.

First, look at the whole piece. It was a thing for the Times magazine's 100th anniversary, written as if by someone looking back from 2098, so the point was to be fun and provocative, not to engage in careful forecasting; I mean, there are lines in there about St. Petersburg having more skyscrapers than New York, which was not a prediction, just a thought-provoker.

But the main point is that I don't claim any special expertise in technology -- I almost never make technological forecasts, and the only reason there was stuff like that in the 98 piece was because the assignment required that I do that sort of thing. The issues about Bitcoin, however, are not technological! Everyone agrees that it's technically very sweet. But does it work as money? That's a very different kind of question.

And the fact that people are throwing around my 98 quote actually shows that they don't get this point -- that they're confusing technology with monetary economics.",fjuezmx,2020-03-08 06:23:16,10

It's hard to say when this will stop. That kind of manipulation costs a lot of fiat money to pull, but fiat is something the Fed has infinite amounts of so it could take a while before the USD has devalued badly enough and Bitcoin market cap and natural price support are strong enough to make it systematically too risky for the Fed to continue price suppression using futures. The good news is that every round of QE weakens the USD, discredits the Fed, undermines buying power, and strengthens Bitcoin's appeal in the public eye making price suppression increasingly expensive to pull and harder and harder to conceal.

I appreciate that, but Amaury went off the deep end with IFP.

&gt;correctly *framing* the fundamental problems associated to a digital currency, both from an economic perspective and from a software perspective

&gt;*not* playing political power games, which kills any rational discussion

fan_of_hakiksexydays,"To the people who are using this rare chance to say Bitcoin follows the stock market and the rest of the world markets:

1- Bitcoin was already on a downward trend since mid February. Several days prior to the first Dow dip, Bitcoin had gone from 10,300 to 9,600.

2- Bitcoin started diving over the weekend before markets even opened. It was already significantly down before this second stock market drop.

So if you say there is any real correlation to the stock market, then it looks like world markets are following Bitcoin. Which we all know is unlikely.

Now there may be a correlation to the general worldwide Corona fear, as opposed to just following the stock market. That I can see as a more valid theory, and as something accelerating an already downward trend.

Bitcoin is very volatile, so sooner or later it will have a dip at roughly the same time as markets. It can't be always be doing the exact opposite either, otherwise that means there is a strong reverse correlation. Not being correlated means sometimes briefly synching.

Bitcoin is the hardest asset on earth, the only one you can truly own. Now, this fact alone isn't enough - people have to realize this. I think necessity will force more people in than out.

jahoooo,"Hello my friends. I'm back from my mods-sponsored vacations I've been sent to, presumably  for trolling bulls at $9k. Having time to rethink my ways in isolation I've come to realisation how wrong I was. To compensate I've put together some quality analysis based on recent developments, full of hopium that is guaranteed to make your bags^(\*) feel immediately lighter.

**Bitcoin is a safe haven**

These trying times have quite clearly shown that bitcoin is going to be a go to asset during the impending recession. As you can see on the [charts](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ESolfqgXgAI2Px9?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096) the market hasn't quite caught up to it yet, which is excellent as we can all load up for the one last time before the generational wealth transfer takes place.

**This halving is just like the previous two**

I remember watching all the YouTube videos in 2016 predicting $20k bitcoin on a daily basis and thinking to myself ""no way this is going to happen"". I was in disbelief and missed out on all the gains, which made me then look for the ""next bitcoin"" and go all-in on Vechain in January 2018. Not going to be fooled again though! 

As you can see on this [chart](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BLX/JIGlHgyf-BTC-pre-halving/) during both previous pre-halving periods the price would establish a moderate, but solid uptrend as confirmed by *higher highs* and consistently staying above 21w ema. The fact it's not behaving this way right now is clearly to shake out the weak hands and cool off the RSI.

**S2F as valid as ever**

S2F creator PlanB predicted the price [will not go under $8200 in 2020](https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1226918629213499392) and recently reiterated it should be an absolute floor for the dip. The fact that we're lower than that proves the market is wrong. The model is intact as we can deviate from it by an arbitrary amount without invalidating it.

**CME gaps above**

In trading it's important to be able to tell apart the memes (like coronavirus) from real fundamentals which actually affect the market. 

One of the strongest fundamental drivers of bitcoin price is filling of CME gaps. Even if there was no halving and coronavirus were about to wipe out half of the population you can rest assured those gaps are guaranteed to get filled, and we now have two above us at 8.9k and 11.7k. The entire and only reason we dropped here was to fill the gap at 7.7k and none of that meme flu panic.

**Bearish exuberance**

The fact that some bears out there come up with unthinkable targets such as $6k or even $5k is a sure sign of exuberance and we all know how it ends. Everyone should be able to see that a modest and perfectly rational target of $100k is a foregone conclusion at this point and current prices are most likely a once-in-a-lifetime bargain.

**Bitmex traders provide reassurance**

While it's pretty clear that the market is wrong about current valuation of bitcoin, it is reassuring that Bitmex traders, known for their excellent track record, appear to have no doubts about where this is heading. The funding rate has not once gone into negative territory since the ~~top~~ higher high at $10.5k and future premiums are consistently positive which should fill you all with confidence that the bottom is in and a better buying opportunity may never present itself.

And finally, remember, in a risk off environment, when people seek safety in cash and volatility is high, it's best to stick to high leverage bets on new asset classes in illiquid markets.

Psych40,"I think there’s a lot of people here mistakenly (or deliberately) conflating “uncorrelated” with “negatively correlated.” 

Positing that Bitcoin is an uncorrelated asset class doesn’t mean that when the stock market crashes Bitcoin is supposed to moon - particularly when we’re in a time of clear short-term panic and everyone is hoarding cash. 

I think the true test will be in the coming weeks / months, particularly when we’ve transitioned from mass economic panic to more of an ongoing, rolling economic downturn with QE infinity firmly in place. At that point the Halvening will be in the rear view mirror and we can finally see how Bitcoin will perform in a bona fide recession / depression.",fk4d2je,2020-03-11 01:34:23,5
SloppySynapses,"The main difference is that that production change information wasn't available until a few days ago. 

Now I'm not saying it's priced in, but...there's a very big difference there

There's also the possibility (at least, in my speculative opinion), that miners have been hoarding their coins for years in anticipation of the halving.

Why? Well, here's my personal, elaborate speculative theory on the past few years.

Bitcoin miners have always seemed to be extremely inverted when it comes to btc cycles. This is because they *form* the cycles. They hoarded at $6k+ all of 2018 until there was simply 0 demand left at $6k to support those prices anymore. Once the floor fell thru, all hell broke loose, and those same miners avoiding selling anything above $6k began literally *net shorting* their stashes below $4k.

Once miner stashes had been depleted, the market ripped upwards because of the complete lack of supply. 

The rip scared nearly everyone into panic holding (I used to use this term back in 2018) their supply again, and a $9k floor was created. History repeats, descending triangle, big dump, bada Bing bada boom, Sept 2019 happened. 

Fast forward a few months and go look at all futures premiums and options pricings for the past 6 months and notice people are extremely optimistic in general- nearly every bottom happens on a net neutral sentiment for futures (premium = $0) rather than negative sentiment. That is, very, very few market participants are actually betting on the price to go down (reflected in bfx longs/shorts as well).

The overarching sentiment the past 6 months has essentially been a big flashing sign that says **DO NOT SELL BEFORE THE HALVING** 

This kind of thinking leads to hoarding yet again. 

And thus it's possible that the halving will have the exact opposite effect people expect short term- miners who have hoarded won't be making the same money as they made at $6k in 2018 unless price is at $12k, so they must begin selling their stashes.

---

In essence, with BTC, it's a common occurrence that an artificial reduction in supply due to hoarding nearly always creates a false sense of demand that can fool people for long periods of time, when in reality there is loads of supply overhead waiting to be unloaded as soon as the underlying market belief that there is no supply left is threatened at all.

---

This is, essentially, why I continue to prefer shorting btc over longing it, with the sole exception of the $3-4k range. I looked for long term longs there not only because of price action (weakening sell pressure on second dip to $3.3k, negative funding for months) but because that price action mirrored my exact sentiments of what was happening: miners and large holders (crypto prop desks, hedge funds, large eth/alt holders, etc) were capitulating.",fk4jb1i,2020-03-11 02:32:51,3

So yeah, what about that?

Bitcoin needs to fulfill its original goal. P2P cash for the 5 billion unbanked, living on less than $10 a week. It needs be a currency.  One that is usable, directly on chain, without permission. That was the entire invention.

The problem with that of course is that BTC has never had to go through turbulent times in the global economy.  Will that trend line hold if stocks drop a lot more?

paperraincoat,"Ok so, I know this is meant in jest, but depending on what flavor of economic apocalypse you think is going to actually happen, your investment playbook can vary wildly:


Scenario A: You think that the Coronavirus will cause a gigantic economic blip/market correction, and governments will step in with gigantic stimulus packages (pushing towards hyperinflation). Best option here would be to pull your money out into cash, wait for things to tank 40, 50, 60% or whatever, then buy 'safe haven assets', stock in old, gigantic stable companies, gold, silver, commodities, Bitcoin etc. 


Scenario B: You think we'll have a giant market correction, but governments will step back and allow this market correction to play out naturally in a 'free markets' style. Then the playbook is still pulling your money out into cash but *holding* said cash as countries experience stagflation a'la Japan in the past twenty years. Everything (food, housing, health insurance, cars) get 2-4% cheaper year over year, the stock market flatlines and anyone that pulled out into cash (I think Warren Buffett took this approach last year?) wins. 


Scenario C: You think the Coronavirus fears are unfounded, the media is overhyping things and this will blow over in a few months just like bird flu, swine flu, SARS, MERS, Zika etc. You can just ride this out. Continue to purchase stocks, bonds, crypto at regular intervals because this minor blip will recover in six months anyway, and we'll be back to business as usual.

SuperJew113,"John Galton tried making an ancap paradise in Acapulco, one of the most violent cities in the world.

Beautiful scenery, but yea.

He was a bitcoin millionaire. This was a libertarian crowd, anarchists with a strong capitalism theme to it all. Hippies of  a sort, definitely enjoyed Marijuana.

They have some kind of shindig annually called Anapulco or something for ancapitalists.

By the sounds of it and looking at John Galton (btw a take off of John Galt in a ancapitalism novel by Ayn Rand) it was like the film ""The Beach"" but with a heavy libertarian/right wing/Extreme Capitalism bend to it all.

Unfortunately his taste for marijuana and producing marijuana where lived, had alerted the cartels in the area that he was becoming a threat to their income stream, and they gunned him down in his living quarters and harmed his friend pretty badly. And he had every reason to believe this would be the fallout of that

&amp;#x200B;

To me this is ancapitalism in a nut shell, then it's just whoever has the biggest baddest guys in existence with the most guns, they're not going to have an ""The Beach"" style ancapitalism utopia, violence wins there's no governing body in essence to prevent this kind of conduct.

SOme of his fellow ancapitalists tried hawking some kind of self-sustenance farming plot of land in, I think it was Peru, but when they got there it was like Fyre Festival, and basically a big scam in the ancapitalist world.

OP spent the inheritance on Bitcoin and then it tanked. This is when ""tanked"" meant prices going from $400 to $200. He wanted to know if he should stay invested, or if there's anything he could get in trouble for legally.

Everybody in the thread, including me, told the guy he's a idiot for gambling an inheritance and that he should sell the rest immediately. 

If he didn't sell after that thread, and then did sell in December 2017 near the peak, he would be a millionaire. Let's say he bought in at $400/coin and had $50,000 worth of an inheritance... that would be almost $2.5 million before taxes if he sold near $20,000.

Unlike financial crises, a health crisis cannot be stopped with cash injections. All rules are out the window right now until this virus is contained. It's up to you to make an opinion about when that might happen.

I give it a week max until the USA and Western Europe shuts down completely, but the sooner it happens the less long the pain will be.

I remember fondly back when we were thinking up as a community what the bitcoin logo could look like - and then using the thai baht ascii character to abbreviate it; that was cute. This community has been one that has been optimistic, pessimistic, supportive, and cruel, and it's been nice going through all of it with you and having something to experience and learn from during this wild ride. 

I bought in, once upon a time, during the pre-sale, and today, I was fully liquidated. I'm glad to be able to have taken the opportunities that were afforded to me by investing in this early on.  That additional personal risk probably wasn't the wisest thing to have taken on with my net worth tied up in a hyper volatile asset, but I'm still glad for the experience.

Qwahzi,"Nano isn't Proof of Stake, it's Open Representative Voting (ORV), which is quite different from traditional DPoS:

In Nano, anyone can be a representative, no funds are staked or locked up, users can remotely re-delegate their voting weight to anyone at any time, representatives do not earn transaction fees, blocks are not built or chosen, and representatives cannot censor or reverse transactions

Nano uses a block-lattice data structure where everyone has their own blockchain (instead of only one single massive blockchain like Steem or Bitcoin), and those account-chains can only be updated by the account owners. This means that the only thing Nano representatives can do is validate transactions - they're not compiling groups of transactions and adding them to a main chain like in other cryptocurrencies",fkfcuqc,2020-03-14 05:33:55,5

diradder,"&gt; the 1st peer you connect to is legitimate and that they're giving you a legitimate copy of the ledger

That's not really how IBD works on Bitcoin though, the first block is hard-coded (verifiable across all the implementations that use the same one), work is then verified from the start and blocks that are fed to you by all the other nodes that help you with the IBD is verified completely... there's no trust in this once you have verified the rules of the software you run (open source and reproducible builds). Least you want to go into conspiratorial territories where both the software you verified/run and all the nodes who fed you data were all involved in lying to you with data that still matched those rules somehow (that would require multiple collision of nested hashing.... I think we don't have easy names for the number of probability of this ever happening). But when I've said nothing is completely trustless I meant within reason, I would never demand this from Nano either. I was only curious which was the trend in terms of trustlessness and how it was effectively organized currently and what was the plan when scaling up.

&gt; The Nano community is constantly creating new representatives and pushing more decentralization, but ultimately it's up to the users.

Yeah I've figured as much. Then I'll give it that, your developers/users seem aligned with the same goals as Bitcoin in terms of decentralization/trustlessness and you've just chosen another set of slightly different compromises in term of governance that seem better than just DPoS or worse just PoS... which make the coin at least interesting in terms of testing grounds.

Lastly, two things I've never looked into admittedly in Nano are the ability to build smart contracts/mutli-sigs scheme and the ability to transact anonymously. For the former Bitcoin has those abilities and they are put to good work in few scenarios (LN, securing funds for multiple parties, escrows, inheritances, etc.)... and the latter developers are hard at work for things like Schnorr and signature aggregations, Taproot/Tapscript. Is there any work done in those fields on Nano? Or any plan for them?

Obviously you don't owe me answers/research, I've just seen you actively participating on threads here and thought it would be nice to hear it from someone who seems to have experience with Nano. Thanks for the conversation/information, it's pretty interesting.",fkhgv68,2020-03-15 00:08:36,1

thekiyote,"Regarding bitcoin's miners, I think Satoshi originally thought that miners would come from the pool of natural stakeholders.  Not everyone would choose to mine, but those who did would essentially get a lottery ticket for the next block reward/transaction fee.  

I don't think that Satoshi anticipated either mining pools or the lengths people would go to to compete for the block reward, first by adapting graphics cards to mining and then specialized mining hardware, after which I think you have a pretty strong split between the natural and forced stakeholders.

The thing that has to be remembered is that the hash rate of bitcoin doesn't _need_ to be this high for the system to function (difficulty is a tool for btc distribution, not strength of cryptography), nor is a hash rate this high indicative of a strong mining ecosystem, which I think a lot of bitcoin people miss.  I would argue that the early days of bitcoin, when people were largely mining with their CPU or GPUs for a couple of kilohashes apiece, was more secure than the hundreds of quintillion hashes per second that are being mined now, the majority of which are from a smaller number of miners with specific resource advantage, like power plants or Chinese miners.

That doesn't mean the system now is _insecure_, just redonkulously inefficient.  But at the same time, you cannot guarantee that it will stay this way.  As /u/sjoelkatz said, it's a race to the bottom.  You need to be able to make a profit over the cost of what you're spending to win block rewards, so eventually the only people who are able to realistically win rewards are ones with natural advantages, like free/at cost power, and the higher the competition, the more stakeholders will be pushed out, until there's only a few real players left, and then you **do** run the risk of a double spend attack.

As a community, we have become extremely edgy about social attacks, **especially** when it comes to discussing fees. This is a very long story, and I invite you to read and learn about it, but the short story is that eventually almost no individual will transact on-chain bitcoin because fees will bee too high. (Think $100 high...). People will be transacting mainly off-chain, like using Lightning Network. (Again, I invite you to learn about this.) But the key point is that this was used by many, many people to attack bitcoin. Opportunistic pieces of shit, who couldn't care less about what bitcoin is or what it stands for, were using fees as an excuse to attack bitcoin. Even going on US national TV to tout and push their shitcoins. So whenever you bring up fees, even if this with good intention, you'll most likely get lots of flak.

masterRoshi9,"So, to help a guy out who's not an economist and doesn't fully understand the gravity of what just happened, can we have a more in depth discussion on the effects of cutting interest rates to 0 and the 600 B in QE and how that will hypothetically effect the price of ETH or the crypto market in general, other than ""free money/good for eth""?

As I understand it: (correct me if I'm wrong)

* banks can borrow money for 0 interest and hypothetically offer much cheaper loans to incentivize more borrowing

* banks can invest the money borrowed directly into stocks

* increased amount of dollars in circulation devalues the dollar, but this is by design and used to spur economic growth through cheaper exports

So is the thought simply that printing money like this is bad and lower issuance policies of Bitcoin/Ethereum should drive the price up? What are the negative effects of QE and 0 interest rates?",fklolba,2020-03-16 07:26:18,6

automaticblues,"Hey Slim,
Basically Nano is very much a currency whereas a lot of other crypto projects do various things, but are less usable as a currency.
Nano is fast and feeless, which means if you send someone 1 nano, they get the whole nano you send and neither of you pays for the privilege. A small ""proof of work"" calculation is required to avoid spam. This basically means your device has to do some processing to send the payment, so if you tried to spam the network with loads of trivial transactions, it would end up using a lot of processing power, but the processing power to send each transaction is minimal.
As the purpose of Nano is to use it, my recommendation would be to try to get some and then to spend it.
If you set up a wallet, I'll send you your first nano. All you have to do is send me the address.
In general telling someone your receiving address holds little risk. Your wallet will hold the corresponding private key which is what you need to send from that address. That basic mechanism of public-private key pair is common to lots of crypto currencies.
So, find a wallet. Follow the instructions to generate the addresses and I'll send you a small amount. Then I'd say set up another wallet on another device, and send from one to the other to see how fast Nano is. It's pretty remarkable and is a key feature, because Bitcoin especially is S..L..O..W..",fks4vpm,2020-03-18 06:58:51,9

These are some crazy times, but I think there is plenty of opportunity to make great long-term plays in the bitcoin space. I think a solid DCA plan through 2020 will prove to be a very smart choice in the coming 5-10 years, maybe even 1-2 years. 

Bitcoin as an idea/invention/tool has never seemed more useful and important for the economic turmoil that is upon us, but I'm going to try to keep cool and let this experiment play out. The outcome seems obvious to me, and that's why I'm still very interested in this space, but it can REALLY stress you out if you are trying to trade daily or even weekly swings.

satoshisbitcoin,"Today there are ~$10M in new coins sold each and every day, to hold a market price of ~$5400 new money of $10M is required to hold the price flat. If more than $10M comes in price goes up and if less than $10M comes in price goes down.

In 2 months only $5M will be sold every day. If new money continues to come in at $10M the effect is the price has to rise to compensate.

Logically the price only has to rise by 2x to balance, but as bitcoin double interest grows and more than $10M in new money now wants to come in, which rises the price, which increases interest. This proceeds a positive feedback loop and drives the next bubble.

Looking back to the previous cycle $5000 or even $3000 were crazy high prices.

The only difference in this cycle is the halving will happen *at the same time there will be the largest coordinated global central bank asset pumping in the history of mankind*. That is not an exaggeration. They are going to flood the markets with money to recover from this. And by flood I mean many tens of trillions.

To think a fraction of that will not go to bitcoin during the perfect chart setup with the halving is crazy.

Rhamni,"So, Nano's price development has been abysmal since the top. It is lower in dollars now than when BTC hit 3200 over a year ago.

That said, it's one of my favourite coins, and it makes me sad that the market does not share my sentiments. It is the fastest decentralized currency there is. It's as fast as the Lightning network at its best, and it's layer one and really easy to use. It works like people think Bitcoin works when they first start looking into crypto. You just send your coins and they arrive faster than you can tell the recipient that you have sent. It's also feeless. On a practical level the difference between feeless and really low fees (Like everything right now, even Bitcoin) is not that big, but aesthetically, if I send my buddy 1 coin so he can try it out, neither of us wants to look at his wallet and see he has 0.996732351 coins.

It also had no sale of any kind. No ICO, no IEO, no seed round or private sale with locked up coins raining down every few months. All coins were given away for free through a captcha faucet, and it traded for dirt cheap for most of a year before the sudden price explosion at the end of 2017. Surprisingly few coins managed to get anywhere without a sale, but Nano is one of them. It doesn't do smart contracts and its privacy is no better than Bitcoin's, so Nano could never become a lone king of the hill - there would always be room for smart contract platforms and privacy coins. But I think that tradeoff has had the added benefit of keeping most Nano fans more friendly than a lot of other communities. Every coin has moonbois, and I know a lot of people on CC have gotten annoyed from seeing Nano mentioned a lot, but considering how many people on here like it, I think the community is a lot less obnoxious per capita than a lot of other communities.

As to security without mining, I just want to say that to perform any kind of attack on Nano you would need to control a majority of the votes, and as a bad actor that means a majority of the actual tokens. You would need the cooperation of at least Binance + the second, third and fourth biggest holders... And honestly, the biggest exchanges are not likely to conspire to doublespend a coin that's trading on their platforms. Plus even if they did, the value of Nano would go to zero *and* all those exchanges would lose all community good will.

I hope in the long run Nano does well. It's one of very few coins with no token sale and strong, continuous development (Not being a traditional blockchain, it can't just copypaste from other projects).",fkvpupl,2020-03-19 08:30:22,42

Since then the number of COVID19 jobs have been sparser, as it appears the network is well stocked with processing power at the moment, still I encourage others to join the hunt for proteins. Text from a few days ago:

I tried this out last night, its fairly easy to setup, but you do have to allow for express install on windows. custom installing is too much of a headache. once it's installed, it opens up a Firefox (Brave browser doesn't work, go figure) GUI where you can set how much CPU/GPU power you want to have dedicated to helping solve/folding proteins. YOU CAN USE YOUR CPU. 

The COVID19 project is under the ""All"" category.

**In response to the nihilistic comments in this thread, I'll say this: I think if you have any spare computing power you should try this altruistic distributed computing experiment. Folding some proteins in virtual for the benefit of a COVID19 vaccine is very much in the spirit of early Bitcoin mining. And I feel it would make Satoshi proud to know that the little community he seeded grew into something that would be brave enough to take on the monsters of this world, in more ways than one.**

**And make no mistake, realistically, I don't believe our collective virtual protein folding will make a big difference, even if all 1000000 subscribers were to dedicate our resources to this (my best guess is that 21 of us will. maximum). But sometimes, it's not about what will likely happen, but what is good for the soul. Hope is a wonderful thing, and people need hope in any small way with today's stressful events.**

**So tonight I'll be letting this program run on my rig. Hope you all join me.**

I’ve been through it all, from Silk Road, to Gox, 1000 China bans, the list goes on. If there one thing I’ve learned from all this, it’s that bitcoin does not like uncertainty. Regretfully, I’ve found myself posting bearish comments the past few days. Yesterday i was on here writing comments about how one would be delusional to think that the recent rise would continue. There is not a correlation between bitcoin and equities, as history has proven, but when investors are dumping proven assets because they see the writing on the wall, you have to question what the real capitulation is going to be like for us in this space. I know not what the future holds, but there is one thing i will say to that end: hedging the dollar is not our use case. With people wondering how they’re going to pay the bills next month, there’s no reason for us to be excluded from the circumstantial bear market we currently face. I’ll be the first to say that this will rocket back up quickly once the uncertainty is behind us, and there is no doubt that permabulls are not wrong for buying at these levels since long term there is no doubt this is a discount, but short term this will unfortunately get worse before it gets better.",fl1uesh,2020-03-21 05:35:16,18

isoiso1000,"Overview of Bitmex during the crash:

On Mar 12 the price of Bitcoin started to crash. After stopping briefly at 5600 the price fell below 3900 on all major fiat exchanges. The magnitude of this movement placed a huge stress on the ability of Bitmex to handle liquidations of losing traders. In theory BitMex will in this situation:

Liquidate a position when the account equity is not enough to cover the loss on the position. If the liquidation price is better than the bankruptcy price, the excess goes into the insurance fund. If the liquidation price is worse, the insurance fund covers the difference. If the insurance fund runs out, the winning trader is auto deleveraged.

This move was different, the move was so sharp that Bitmex chose to leave liquidations hanging. At one point there was 20m in bids and over 100m in pending long liquidations. Any move to fill these liquidations as designed would risk fully wiping out the insurance fund. Bitmex decides to gamble and protect the insurance fund and the site by not filling liquidations. At this point Bitmex needs the price to pump, yet it is held down by these liquidations. The most amazing possible thing to save the site would be a temporary pause to allow spot to pump and orderbooks to fill. Bitmex gets their miracle as an ‘unplanned cloud physical event’ (later re-classified as a 'DDOS attack on the chat box' occurs). It is impossible to know the exact details behind this action. What is known and that Bitmex agrees to: this event was enormously beneficial (possibly saving the entire site), and trivially within the ability of Bitmex to carry out.

Once the site was down the price was able to pump. When the site comes back online, traders who were short are now liquidated based on the mark price (5400) even though the actual orderbooks are trading at (4500). Bitmex is able to create a forced bid (short liquidation) and use this to fill a forced ask (long liquidation) while the insurance fund profits off this entire spread. As the market stabilizes Bitmex continues to send in long liquidations for several hours. The gamble paid off and the insurance fund increases after a catastrophic event, to over 36,000 coins.

What does this mean?

Bitmex will act to preserve itself when market stress arises. The insurance fund will switch from a theoretical backstop to a speculative trading instrument controlled by Bitmex trading in its own interest. I have always considered Bitmex one of the most trustworthy sites, I have never come across a credible report of them stealing or having weak security. This event however demonstrates that their advertised systems are at the whim of what they feel is needed for the site and their insurance fund will exploit traders as needed in extreme situations.


Example:

Short 10m

Entry Price 10k

Price falls to 100

Profit 9.9m

Coins needed to payout profit, 99,000

Actions during this event strongly suggest the insurance fund in practice is a trading vehicle purely at the discretion of Bitmex. If the price falls too far they have the option to simply shut the site down or pause liquidations to protect their fund, this is effectively what they chose to do. This also sets up a huge boost to the insurance fund when the site comes back and there are simultaneous active long/short liquidations, the engine simply confiscates the gap and puts it into the 'insurance fund'",fl26e1s,2020-03-21 07:39:16,5

During periods of high inflation a smart person holds Bitcoin (or gold ie. money) as a store of value and only converts small chunks into rapidly depreciating local currency as required.

rattie_ok,"1. BCH is actively working on privacy and fungibility: CoinJoin and CashFusion are two protocols used right now to make your funds untraceable. NANO has nothing on the roadmap regarding fungibility, decentralized mixing, or private transactions.

1. It's harder to grind BCH network to halt than NANO, because you need money to keep spamming the network. Miners would love if you'd keep spamming BCH network, because they'd profit from it.

2. In Bitcoin, by design, network security is separate from fund security. Even if you had 51% hashrate, you still couldn't spend other people's coins. 

3. BCH has the same hash algorithm as BTC, so it's just a matter of time when the hashrate will come back home.

3. BCH is scriptable and open for customization. You can put any text in OP_RETURN field. You can use blockchain for tweets (memo.cash) or for notary uses (e.g. notary.bitcoin.com). Multi-signature schemes, timelocks, and other exotic use is possible with BCH.

4. There are multiple implementations of BCH full node software.

5. Ledger Live supports BCH out of the box. More payment processors support BCH and BTC than NANO, though this is purely a network effect kind of thing.

5. BCH is literally the same Bitcoin as Bitcoin, only better. If you have some old software which works on Bitcoin only, refurbishing it for BCH would need minimal effort. Bitcoin developer community is large. NANO on the other hand is completely different beast.",fl58d61,2020-03-22 07:47:03,2

#What are the people like?

Super friendly. Everywhere has mean, toxic, and bitter people. But overall, the people in Houston love strangers and are friendly to talk to. They want to know about you and what you’re up to and are happy to have a conversation that isn’t just superficial. If you’ve only ever lived in New England, Chicago, or LA this will be a huge culture shock for you. 

A great example of the difference became apparent when I got back to New England and talked with one of the checkout ladies at the local grocery store. She, like almost all of the New Englanders I know, assumed that the mass hoarding of goods that I saw at HEB and other stores was because people were hoarding for themselves. The reality, though, is that largely those people were hoarding for their communities. See, in Texas, there’s a social contract to keep and eye out for those around you. If you see your neighbor doesn’t have power, you offer them food, or shelter, or heat, or water. Whatever they need. You help your neighbor because they are there. In New England and other liberal areas, people expect the government to provide for these needs, and in turn, they pay the government taxes. Texas has a totally different mindset: it’s the individual’s job to keep the people around them up and going, and the government's job to stay out of their lives.

I want to be clear, both systems have their merits and problems. I want the reader to understand that two very different systems exist. Which one the reader prefers to live under is up to them, but if you move to Texas, you WILL be living in the one that requires you, rather than the State, to provide for basic needs. This is why the taxes are so low. This is why everything is so cheap; so that you can afford to do that. People who have plenty hoard so they can provide to those who don’t have enough. The road to Hell is paved with just as many good intentions as assuming the government could solve the same problem any better.

#What about food?

BBQ is amazing here. Avoid chain restaurants of all sizes. The chains will still be good, but worse than what you could get elsewhere. Rendezvous, in Memphis, TN, remains the best BBQ I’ve ever had full stop. But the BBQ in Texas was at least as good as Rendezvous.

Blue Belle Ice Cream is also a native of Texas; get some. It’s better than Ben and Jerry’s and ½ the price.

#How about parking?

I didn’t need to pay to park anywhere. Now, when visiting the Museum of Natural History, I did choose to park around ½ a mile away so that I could avoid paying to park right at the museum, but that was my choice. In general, you’ll find free parking at/near wherever you want to be. The city is laid out for people to drive around within it, and almost every store or restaurant I saw had a parking lot of some form.

#Public Transit?

It exists, but...seriously, look at the size of Houston on Google Maps, and then compare it to the 4 public transit lines they have. For all indentured porpoises (sic) there is no public transit.

#Is there stuff to do?

Hell yea brother! There’s stuff to do all over. You don’t have to live in Houston to find things to do. There are plenty of dog parks scattered all over, and people are friendly enough that even if you don’t have a dog, you can show up and just talk to the people who are there, while also getting to pet the dogs as they come by. Do wear clothes that can get muddy, wet, and slobbery though. It’s a dog park. Dogs are rarely clean.

There are malls, shopping centers, bars, and other activities in most of the more well-off neighborhoods (indoor Skydiving near The Woodlands and a few others I saw, but don’t remember where). And, if you want to get into the city itself, Katy and The Woodlands are both a 30-40 minute drive or less. K1 racing has indoor electric go-karts that go like 40-50 MPH. It’s hella fun. A bit pricey, but fun. There are plenty of shooting ranges, and they don’t require you to buy your ammo at the range to shoot there.

Meetup.com is fairly useless in the city, but that is a problem with a lack of providers for content, rather than a lack of people who want to participate. Most of the meetup groups want to make money off being a meetup leader. If you just want to hang out with people, make a group, host some events, enjoy people’s company. Or, go to a church (once the Human Malware outbreak passes) and meet people there, if so inclined.

#How about dating?

The couples I saw were all about the same attractiveness. If you can look in the mirror and be honest with yourself, and are attracted to people about the same beauty level as you are, the odds are you’ll find someone without too many problems. If you want to punch above your weight class, regardless of gender, you are going to have a bad time. The city is mostly an app-based dating city though. There are no singles meetups or groups I could find. People tend to either meet ‘in the wild’, at church, or through apps. I see it as a blessing and a curse. It gives you a reason to improve yourself to the point that you are the peer of the person you seek to date, but it also means that if you wanted to trade (overweight, but a good provider) you’re SOL because there’s a good provider who is also attractive just around the corner.

#Closing thoughts

Overall, I like Houston. I’d visit it again, and if I ever win the Bitcoin Lottery, I might have a winter home there. Katy, TX is the exact ideal of the life I want once I find a wife. Whether we have kids or not, both the master-planned and organic subdivisions in and around Katy are the exact type of place I want to live.

GenghisKhanSpermShot,"I'm about to write something I would have laughed everyone out of the building just a week ago but I have to consider it. Two questions as traders you should always ask is where is the most pain and where is the liquidity and what are the extreme scenarios. 

In 2008 the house denied tarp and we had a massive selloff in stocks. Politics aside the house and senate are not agreeing on a package yet (Pelosi just said she's not agreeing to the current plan), that's going to spook the market until the giant bazooka stimulus gets passed. I think the market will selloff and so will precious metals and Bitcoin, there will be a race to USD as it goes for it's last insane bullish run.  Everyone will attribute this to Bitcoin being coupled to the stock market which isn't true at all, it's tied to USD. 

I can't believe I'm saying this but I'm eyeing [$1200.....................................................
](https://www.tradingview.com/x/rjU3O7jM/)
Add to that I noticed in 2015 Bitcoin had a massive selloff down to the last top at [$165](https://www.tradingview.com/x/tEDyknRL/), if that happens again that would put us at about $1200.

Add to that longs are still [way too many](https://blockchainwhispers.com/bitmex-position-calculator/) for a bottom I think. 

If this really happens this will be a massive shock to crypto and shake it to it's core, BUT it will be a life changing opportunity if you have the guts to buy. It would still be a giant bullflag and still in an uptrend overall and after a multiple trillion dollar stimulus that would cause inflation and a race to deflationary protection. 

I expect to get ridiculed and hope this doesn't happen but it's something we have to consider, I have cash ready if this plays out.  One of my favorite time cycle guys that has been consistantly right said he expects a bullish turn for Bitcoin in early April, we could have a giant flush and start to turn around there.",fl7x23q,2020-03-23 06:06:52,9

bitvote,"$1200 seems too low to me. but just my sense of it. 

I do believe there's a good chance that the total crypto market will revisit the $100-115B range. If that happens then I think we revisit bitcoin dominance in the 70-75% range. Which gives us a price range for BTC of ~$3,825-$4,715. 

Add in the chance of a 10-25% overshoot and the worst case bottom (imo) would be in the $2.8k range. 

Most people will be shitting themselves at this level. It'll clear out all the weak hands. Reset the table. And we'll be clear for another bull run. And I'm definitely betting that it'll come. and it will be a thing of beauty.",fl8184y,2020-03-23 06:49:05,3

We don't have to agree on when things will turn around, at some  point (barring extinction or a third term for Trump) the global econ _will_ turn around. 

And I'm still a huge believer that bitcoin will turn around too. and see a new ATH high once we do. 

If we're looking for positives, how about this: The halving could create a scenario where bitcoin becomes beautifully sensitive to any bull momentum, where the drop in supply magnifies upward movement. And provides a backstop against further drops. 

The halving will take some time to take effect, the drop in supply is obv effective immediately, but if miners (and other market participants) have been holding back supply, then any release/sales of that supply may mute bull momentum. 

At some point we'll be fully adjusted to the 6.25btc/blocks. And from that moment forward bitcoin will become a powder keg of bullish potential. Ready to explode at the first 20%+ jump. 

And, if we're already going down the wet dream path, let's go all the way: If the standard financial markets are still in the doldrums. If they're providing flaccid returns. Then bitcoin could be poised for its moment in the sun. When the world is finally ready to accept bitcoin as the one and only true savior of our financial world.

atruepoet,"We've oscillated between 5.9 and 6.2 like 10 times in the last 48 hours - while the futures tripping breakers is worrisome for multiple reasons (both financial and virus-related), and BTC dropped following this afternoons press conference, I don't know that I'd call ""crypto blown the fuck out."" 

I feel like some people are paranoid when it comes to whale manipulation, of course it's a large element in market forces, but there's tens of thousands of private traders with smaller (and large) stacks that aren't all behaving in a cooperative manner, but instead are subject to the standard market principles that affect both conventional assets of the stock market and crypto. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just because a price move happens in tandem doesn't inherently mean there's some overarching correlation that fundamentally invalidates cryptocurrency as a whole, it's utility, value, merit, or even price. 

There's a logical reason that BTC dropped given world events - and that has to deal with human psychology and economic behavior on a macro level. FUD in society is going to cause FUD in systemic financial appendages of society - which **both** bitcoin and stock are. 

But to be so confident that 'whales' conspired with the sole objective of running an ""anti-correlation bull trap,"" to me, is not following any of the top occam's razor explanations. 

Put another way, lets say futures weren't a thing for the stock market, and we didn't have hourly updates on coronavirus news, all variables were static this afternoon - contrary to the reality: that all those things actually playing a role in the collective awareness of economic and pandemic related matters...BTC was still at a fiercely matched resistance level between 6.4 ish and 5000's, I think some call this a gravity well. 

So if you hypothetically removed all those variables and looked at BTC in isolation, the odds were in my opinion fairly likely we would have seen 6 break this afternoon anyway, as price discovery and bull vs bear battles continued. 

Maybe I'm overlooking something, and I'm by **no means** an expert in TA, market analysis, or finance, beyond being blued to crypto charts since 2015 and having a diverse portfolio - but overall, this sub lately has been saturated with unsubstantiated quick comments without any substance beyond conjecture, or just enough substance to FUD someone who is less informed / newer to the space, into adopting the commenter's POV (often a POV they've adopted due to their fucking up a trade and are salty about it)

There's the group who believe some mix of the following: 

- we're on the verge of mooning
- everything is priced in
- coronavirus is overblown
- we'll be back to normal in 8 days - at the end of Trump's 15 plan. or mid-April at the latest
- We're already past peak panic
- the world about to wake up, en masse, to the genius of Satoshi and will be throwing every dollar they have into bitcoin

And the other group believing the polar opposite:

- bitcoin (and all risk-on assets) are going to be under continued pressure, re-visiting lows or making new lows
- Hardly anything is priced in bcs how can anything be priced in when we're in the middle of so many unknowns?  
- coronavirus is a very real threat - to health and economies
- Normal? This _is_ the new normal. Lockdown til May (or later) and then gradual return to public life with a few billion gallons of hand sanitizer and everyone staying six feet apart for at least 12-18mos.
- Peak panic? We probably haven't seen anything yet... 
- Bitcoin is squarely risk-on and as the world deteriorates and second order impacts pile on, panic will increase. 

I don't think I've ever seen such a stark contrast in here since the the buttcoiner days. This sub was flooded with nocoiners, claiming that bitcoin was trash and would soon be dead. And now this...

SloppySynapses,"I think what you just pointed out is the strangest part of being a maximalist for me that's always turned me off from fully endorsing it.  

I think BTC is a good bet as a hedge against inflation- buying it essentially means you're potentially protected in the small chance that global economies collapse and bitcoin moons against all major currencies.

Which means, unless you're some sort of sadistic doomer/prepper apocalypse type, you shouldn't even be hoping for bitcoin to moon, unless your plan is to rule the world one day because you bought earlier than everyone else who got fucked over in the economic collapse that allowed it to succeed. 

I understand *being prepared* for it and buying it *lest* the worst happens and you're unprepared- holding a zimbabwe-esque dollar, losing value rapidly to the brrr's of the government money printers. But hoping that it will happen seems to me to either be sadistic at worst, or pure, unadulterated greed veiled as belief in the technology at best

No judgment really, I understand being greedy and wanting to be one of the only people with any money in a doomsday type scenario- it's appealing in a sort of Will Smith ""I Am Legend"" way where you rule the post-apocalypse earth. But that's why pretending that it's some sort of belief in the technology has always seemed dishonest to me

Anyway. Just thinking out loud because I guess I never knew how to articulate that until now.

I will always watch bitcoin and pay attention to what it's doing because of the very small potential for that scenario to come true, particularly right now. I've never felt like BTC's price action the past few years has mattered much, because it's mainly just been a game of ""how to fuck over overleveraged traders"" but now that nearly *all* cryptotwitter-esque gamblers have gotten completely BTFO in the past 3 months, the next 3-6 months of price discovery will probably be legitimately enlightening as to what BTC's real use case is. Is it truly a store of value? A hedge against inflation? Or was it just a fun gambling token all along?

I will personally never hope for the situation where BTC holders get incredibly rich- because the quality of my life and others around me will probably rapidly descend to utter shit in the actual scenario that it comes true. If it does happen, I believe I have the skills to capitalize it and make myself a lot richer from it, but I generally hope that it never comes true.

bitusher,"First of all , It is generally a bad Idea to be getting investment advice from strangers and on reddit or social media. I am giving you some information here just as a jumping off point for you to do your own research and verify things for yourself and learn a bit more. 

Past historical performance does not equal future expectations and you need to prepare for ""black swan"" events and disasters like we are currently experiencing. 

Also you should learn why day trading is so dangerous and why most retail day traders end up losing money -

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/c4zpw9/what_are_the_steps_to_trading_bitcoin/erzkfmm/

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM6exo00T5I

You should investigate how money is created and the different asset classes and understand that if you are lucky enough to live in a stable economy the best you can typically hope for is your fiat currency like the euro or US dollar will slowly lose 2 % in purchasing power each year.  

&gt; if I bought bitcoin would that be a viable defense against inflation?

Historically, In the short term = 1 to 2 years Bitcoin is a horrible Store of Value due to how volatile it is. Do not invest in Bitcoin if you are planning on getting rich quick in less than 1 year , in fact , its probably wise to avoid any investment until you can learn why this is so dangerous and will reinforce risky and bad investment practices. 

Over the 1-2 year periods Bitcoin has been an excellent store of Value and a great (but also risky and experimental ) investment.

If you have a few more minutes read this article :

------------------------------------------

Now is gold a good store of value against inflation? Go ahead and look at 100 year charts and 10 years charts and you will see many times that gold has consistently lost purchasing power against the US dollar year after year in certain time periods. gold has decreased in purchasing power for periods of 36+ years , year after year as an example, and in most recent history almost 4 years straight. Looking at the last 10 years you might see an average of ~2% returns on gold after inflation so gold could be considered a store of value in this sense , but overall a horrible investment compared to a stock index fund like the SPDR investing in the whole SP500 which can see as high as ~11% average returns over these last 10 years , even after the crash.

Thus gold might be a good store of value in the very longterm as long as you are willing to wait many years of downturn at times before it rebounds. 

------------------------

A very good store of value **short term** if you define store of value as a stable asset that keeps most of its value would be an interest bearing savings account of US dollars that returns 1.5% to 1.7% a year insuring you are only losing 0.3 to 0.7% a year in spending power after inflation. US Tbill used to be better but now have a yield of 0.7- 1% yields for a 10 year thus are less optimal for retail investors

-------------------------------

So what is the bottom line from all of this?

1) do not invest in Bitcoin until you do some basic research into what it is and how to secure it  

2) Do not invest in Bitcoin unless you paid off all high interest debt and have a fiat savings account of at least 3 months of living expenses  (you can buy it to use it and save money instead of investing however -https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/fmm8i2/best_place_to_sell_btc_uk/fl4yg50/ )

3) You should have a diversified and hedged portfolio of uncorrelated and negatively correlated asset classes

https://messari.io/c/research/research-bitcoin-as-an-uncorrelated-asset-class


4) There is no best solution as everyone is unique and should allocate their investments according to their specific needs and circumstances.

I love that bitcoin is not just holding up but strongly holding/recovering value after those first few punches to the gut. 

BUT

I still think we've got a long way to go with this. And my reasoning isn't focused on covid projections. 

The current moment demands the following assumption: 2-4 weeks of closures. That's a shared foundation no matter what you believe about the curve that covid will follow. That particular piece of news is pretty much priced in. 

But here's what I don't believe is priced in: The economic fallout that we'll see bcs of the global lockdown. 

I have been following a lot of the early econ data, I'm not going to list it here bcs it's just too much. But I'm linking to a few twitter accounts below. 

Bottom line: The second/third order effects have the _potential_ to be quite large. Stuff I haven't seen since 2007-2009. These impacts take time to ripple through the economy. It's like a tsunami, the massive energy is there, but it's not really visible. On the open ocean it looks like a small swell. but as it approaches land... watch the fuck out. 

And we're getting early indications that this will be a global financial tsunami. 

I'm going to take an hour today to give my grade school aged daughter an education on supply/demand and how to place a short order to take advantage of hard earned belief in where a market is headed. And, if it's not obvious, I believe that virtually every market (stonks, bitcoin, etc...) are going to go down. And hard. Maybe not tomorrow. or even next week. but in a couple of months, we'll have seen new lows almost everywhere. 

Good luck gents!

DCinvestor,"S&amp;P 500 just closed the second day in a row as green / up. It's not much, but it's something.

To be clear, it's nothing to get too excited about and definitely not a bottom signal, but it may be a sign of at least some interim consolidation on the way down, which otherwise has mostly looked liked it's been in incredible free fall over the past month.

My general hypothesis is that given the unique nature of this crisis and the expectation of damage from shutdowns, stocks went straight to ""vertical"" capitulation- a condition in stocks which often happens after a market tops, then starts to roll over, and bounces down a few times before the big vertical collapse (see S&amp;P 500 in September/October 2008 for an example). The recent volatility in some individual stocks looks more like crypto than what I'm used to from stocks.

*Best case* scenario for me is that we consolidate at around these levels, and then eventually stab down into 1800 to 2100 territory.  If we can't meaningfully consolidate here, then we *should* consolidate at 1800 to 2100 on the weekly, then putting a likely bottom somewhere closer to 1600 (which was the year 2007 top).

I know this isn't a stock trading sub, but the S&amp;P 500 is worth keeping an eye on these days. But it also seems anecdotally that Ethereum, Bitcoin, Gold, and Silver are showing some signs of decoupling from stocks.

I remain fully in my long-term crypto positions (with larger recent adds from $90 to $125 on ETH, $5000 to $5500 on BTC), and still waiting for a bit more blood from stocks before picking up my DCA there in tax-deferred accounts. Otherwise, I'm stacking cash waiting for stock buys in my after-tax accounts. Aiming towards small ETH DCA buys around once every two weeks.

* USA government basically confirming that it'll do everything in its power to not let the economy go to shit.

Back in April of 2018, I was a complete fucktard amateur. Still am.

My very first 'call' was during this time. Everyone was bear and I was shouting the opposite from the rooftops, doing 24 hour coverage on Bitcoin at the time. I remember making an idea on TradingView that was 48 hour coverage on Bitcoin until if it mooned.

One of the updates I made shortly after making the idea was ""Although chances is astronomically small, $6,755 may be the reversal point.""

I'll never forget it.

DarrenTapp,"I'm concerned about how this will effect BTC.  As the difficult dropped around 16% to adjust to the lower price.  Now, the hash rate is slated to increase 26% on the next adjustment.  If this continues then the blocks will come out slow maybe even very slow on the BTC chain.

Here's the difficulty history:

https://fork.lol/pow/difficulty

Here's the expected difficulty change:

https://fork.lol/pow/retarget


BCH has an adjusting difficulty algorithm.  This is more nimble and adjusts to a change in hash rate more quickly.  So BCH does not have the 2 week adjustment problem of BTC.  However BCH is a minority SHA256 chain.  Being a chain with minority hash power is not great.  In fact, it was a problem before and around the BSV BCH split.  


Dash has an adjusting difficulty algorithm called gravity wave.  This does allow for the difficulty to accommodate a change in hash power more quickly.  Also Dash is the majority X11 chain by far, so it doesn't have the minority chain problem that BCH has.  So that's great!!  But wait there's more.

Dash block time targets 2min 30sec.  So even if a block takes six times that target, that's only 15 min.  With bitcoin a slow block of similar variance would take an hour.",flkrlal,2020-03-27 03:12:49,2

GoDM1N,"&gt; (not trying to say that this is some huge flaw, I’m genuinely interested because I don’t know much at all about far right ideology or anarchism)

Yea I get you. I'm not suggesting any of this stuff is a ""flaw"" or ""good"" either just trying to explain my understanding of it all. 

&gt; So as long as literally everything you get is from trading value, it’s far right?

Sure. Then the more government spending your society does the more left you go. AuthRight example in medieval times the king didn't supply the army. The knight had to buy their horse, weapons, armor, etc and the knight was required to serve when told. They even had to buy specific sets of armor so they couldn't just cheap out. LibRight basically the same during the US revolution only the militia chose to be there (or not to be there) and what to buy (or not to buy). Despite popular belief military spending is actually a pretty left thing to do. True right would require the individual to buy their kit because (if we're talking extremes) the government isn't spending anything on its people. Same for police, firefighters, border patrol, etc. Those are paid for by the government. So they're left. I think a lot of people don't realize that and claim some kind of arbitrary ""but culturally..."" but relative to the compass they're left. It doesn't mean all left society has to prioritize military, or a right society cant say ""Well okay we'll tax for the military"" but the nature of today's militaries in regards to funding is left. Nobody is expecting soldiers to show up with their own assault rifle. 

In short, far-right = everything you get is from some form of trade. Healthcare, clothing, transportation, etc. 

&gt; in an ancap society that didn’t have any currency, how would healthcare work? “I’ll only treat your heart attack if you mow my lawn later”. 

Sure or some other thing of value. Doesn't HAVE to be straight up labor. Maybe its a watch, gold bar, a pair of socks, commodities such as salt or just a thank you. Anything is basically ""fair game"" as long as the person providing the service agrees it has the right amount of value and the person buying agrees as well. At least for LibRight... AuthRight might say ""No you cant just take a thank you, it needs to be this"". 

This all said, I don't actually think we'd ever not have ""money"" even in extreme LibRight. Case in point bitcoin. Having a common currency is something people tend to all move towards naturally because it makes life easier.",fllpzl3,2020-03-27 08:29:59,2

VictorCobra,"Your argument raises some really important points, and it may very well end up being the case. However, if crypto were eventually going to zero, I would expect a faster decline, rather than trading in a clear range over two years. If we break down from the range and Bitcoin ends up at $1K, then your theory becomes much more likely. But here’s why I think it’s taking a long time for crypto to “fizzle out,” as you say: 

Cryptocurrencies are unique in the sense that while they are certainly speculative assets, they offer alternatives to an essential economic system based on national fiat currencies and central banks. At the rate things are going with the current economic system, I think it’s easy to imagine a scenario where more people believe cryptocurrencies have value as a medium of exchange and a store of value. All you’d really need is for more of the world to believe a little less in the current financial system. Bitcoin hasn’t made a new low yet because the people who believe in crypto have imaginations. The power of human belief is very strong. Look at religion. Monetary systems are no different. 

Bitcoin hasn’t broken down and faded out (yet) because the narrative that gave birth to it remains intact. Crypto was meant for times like these, where the clear cracks in the system become obvious. Now is the first real test. While it may be scary to hold onto your coins during this time, it’s perhaps the most interesting time in the last 10 years to do so, as long as you can afford to lose it, of course :)

numecca,"Good thing you guys have this new meme to add to your hopeless marketing strategy. I’m sorry to be the one who admits how bad crypto sucks constantly. But you all know it. You all know it’s garbage. And you just want it to go up. That’s why you’re here. Which means somebody better make something that people want. That doesn’t need an explanation as to why they should desire it; they just do. Then you can call yourself gold. But until then, this is a really bad thought model that will totally be assaulted soon. I think it’s a really bad idea to maintain the perception model of gold. Because a more accurate translation is likely coming. And it will make bitcoin look very uninteresting and dated. You shouldn’t have to explain why this matters. It should just matter to people. Why doesn’t it? Any guesses before I get downvoted for disagreeing?",flpdn7x,2020-03-28 09:57:19,6

diydude2,"What is wrong with these people who keep trying to manipulate all markets?  Are they mentally inferior to the average human being?  Hard to imagine that anybody so stupid could be bestowed such ""power,"" but such was the old world.  Thank God that world is now dead as a doornail.

Might as well buy Bitcoin.  It will look good on your karmic record.  Instead of dancing around the Maypole doing money magic or NPCing your way through a lifetime of bondage, you were placing your faith in mathematics and human ingenuity, hoping against hope for a better world.

The world as we knew it is over.  That much is certain.  Where we go now is entirely up to you.

Long, short... it doesn't matter.  If you're looking to make a few dollars, you're a fool.  The dollar can be printed to infinity.  The other side of that equation says it's worth zero.  

I hope that math education becomes a priority in this new world.",flpeget,2020-03-28 10:06:17,4

anon517,"Cash will be king, because people need to eat, pay rent, etc. which are all basic survival items many of which are harder or impossible to buy with Bitcoin right now. Particularly for the millions of people who have never used or don't understand Bitcoin yet.

Right now, I'm seeing a lot of positive scientific developments despite government floundering. Ventilators are being made. Hydroxychloroquine, vaccines, and even antibody blood transfusions are hopeful. Besides, the CFR looks to be around 1% which is very bad but would mean 99% of people will survive.

Kickstarting the economy again after the lockdown will take time. People will still be afraid to travel, go on cruises, particularly because a large number of cases will continue to be around for a long time, even into 2021.

A lot of businesses will collapse. This will mean a lot of people out of work (we've already seen 3 million filed for unemployment, a new record). On top of this, ""cheap money"" will be flooding in for SOME people (who have the credit), causing a rise in prices. This will be OK for people who have decent jobs, but will be horrible for people without jobs.

The situation becomes similar to Venezuela. We have a lot of poor people. So how do we solve the problem of people not having enough money? That's right, the government will print more of it. Causing even higher prices, and more poor people. Over, and over. And people will be wondering, ""why isn't it working?""

So, Bitcoin will not rise rapidly while the coronavirus is threatening people who need food and shelter.

But once that is over, and the economic engines are croaking, unable to get started, a desperate, hungry, angry population will DEMAND the government to DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT which they will make it worse by providing more money, food, shelter to everyone until the country is bankrupt and the dollar is worthless.

And this is when Bitcoin's time will have come.",flrltqk,2020-03-29 04:14:23,1

Ichabodblack,"&gt;That is the classic 'Keynesian' response, but the assumption that people will stop spending is absurd to me, so the question begs the question that people will stop spending.

Really? If my bank has some value X in a deflationary asset and I want to buy something, it would usually be silly of me to spend that asset in it was worth Y in the future, where Y &gt; X. Depending on the delta of Y and X and the timeframe T, it may not be *economically sensible* for me to make the transaction. Instead I should trade something else. In this way a second currency is borne to actually ferry the transactions.

Let's make up some numbers, if my X was £1000 and Y was £2000 and the time delta T was one year. Let's assume a linear growth between the two, then each day my value grows by £2.74 per day. Therefore if I buy anything worth less than £2.74 I have *lost money* on it by the next day. It does not make sense for me to make that purchase. Extrapolate to larger values for the equation and you can see how spending begins to make little sense.

&gt;they are 'pushing spending', but what about 'encouraging saving'? 

Saving is encouraged now. You would just never save in cash. If you're saving in cash you're an idiot.

&gt;we're in a position where many people right now, out of work for more than a week, are going to have serious financial troubles. every defense or premise of that assumptions rings hollow to me.

So? How does that non-sequitur help your argument? You think if the world was Bitcoin based people would still be getting paid? Your argument is asinine. If people had all their money in Bitcoin now they would be *worse off* as the value of Bitcoin dropped by more than things like the value of stock.",flu39du,2020-03-30 00:03:47,1

I gave a general outline without any real script and what Clara conjured up with was better than I had imagined. If you were on the fence I would definitely recommend it.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sexsells/comments/egof4y/rvw_for_uclarabelle_says/)*

fresheneesz,"Honestly i don't think a fractional reserve system is bad for bitcoin in general, tho it does hold risks for people who have fractional reserve accounts. What's bad is inflation of the monetary base (and what that inflation funds). Even with fractional reserve (or no reserve), only the monetary base can actually be used (ie no one can spend more than they have). 

What would be really bad is if someone like coinbase counterfeited bitcoins. This could potentially be impossible to detect from the outside unless there's a run on coinbase. But at very least the counterfeit coins would be contained within their system and wouldn't leak out into the rest of the economy like dollars do.",flu5w01,2020-03-30 00:31:43,1
MarchewkaCzerwona,"&gt;These aren't stupid lies though. This is just plain reality, and I already told you, Bitcoin isn't crippled,.it works fine and sees far more demand than any fork of Bitcoin does.

Those are lies, as no batching, scratching and God knows what else can't mask the fact that btc is crippled chain by its small capacity limit. As I explained it to you, demand you are highlighting is stagnated for years now even though it is still higher than other forks and coins. It is stagnated and with signs of revere because it is self limiting chain. Once too many people use it, fees goes up and chain is unusable. How long you will try to pretend it is anything different. There is big elephant in the small btc room.





&gt;&gt;What is the point of securing in decentralised fashion something that failed already? If it can't function as cash it was created to be, it failed. No point of securing it now with decentralised miners.

&gt;It isn't failed already. That's your problem, I think you're under the impression that just merely saying something makes it so. It doesn't.

But it is failed chain. Look at it. What did it achieved in last two years since the event you highlighted? Absolutely nothing. Just stagnation and repurposing to useless speculation token. Even btc guys are recommending to use paypal or credit cards. WTF? It is failed chain. Failed, as it can't deliver what it was created for. 

It can't even compete with bch in what op is showing here. It can't work for vendors and users. That means it failed. That is not my opinion, that is a fact. Absorb it and then come back to tell me I am wrong. Please, do just that.



&gt;&gt;Bitcoin did scale the way I wanted. On bch chain.

&gt;bch isn't Bitcoin though. Even the bitcoin dot com wallet differentiates between the two.

Yes, between bitcoin core (btc) and bitcoin cash (bch).  Since fork it is important to highlight about which chain we are talking about as both are bitcoin and referring to one simply bitcoin is misleading.

Bitcoin core is bitcoin on btc chain, while bitcoin cash is bitcoin on bch chain.

Classic example of retronym.

My bitcoin cash coins have roots in 2009 genesis block.

&gt;&gt;On btc chain it didn't, but that is not my problem no more. I don't think you get it. I don't think you get how badly btc is derailed.

&gt;I don't think you get it. Bitcoin clearly won by all available metrics and data.

Which metric? What metric? Price? Irrelevant. You can have shit trading for more and it is still shit. Price is not measurement of success in delivering p2p electronic cash. 

Hash power? That would be closer, but even this is not measurement of success of delivering electronic p2p cash. It only proves btc is better in attracting hash power, and it is better at that indeed. Miners will get paid regardless bitcoins (on btc chain) success ad they are happy with current situation as they make a lot of money. They do keep bch afloat just in case too. Think about why.

What other metric? Users? Those speculators and investors that proudly call themselves users? They are irrelevant if all they want is to buy coin to sell it in some time for profit. Those are users of model bitcoin wasn't created for.

What other metric? Please, tell me.




&gt;&gt;No. Not really. LN is just a gadget that will never work and will never lead to adoption.

&gt;It already does work and is slowly seeing adoption and usage.

It doesn't work properly really. It has unsolvable problems and current workarounds are just that - a workarounds with trade offs. Slowly walking away from original purpose of p2p electronic cash with their watchtowers and custodial wallets. No, it is dead end with stupid assumptions. 



&gt;&gt;It is fundamentally stupid and with unsolvable problems.

&gt;No, you just can't comprehend it.

I think I actually know quite a lot of it and have spend way too much on this gadget. But ok, that is something for much deeper discussion so lets say I wish you well with this crap.




&gt;&gt;How can you settle on chain transaction to get chains security when fees might be higher than transaction? You can't.

&gt;You simply don't need to. 

If you don't need to, you gave up on chain security and safety. That is for a start.

&gt;Transactions within the LN clearly have their pros and cons along with a different security model.

Cons mostly, and pros are achievable without this quite complex model.

&gt;Strange that you're happy with the extra risk with 0 conf but not LN transactions.

Because simply LN will introduce same banking model we already have. Nobody will monitor constantly their channels to make sure funds are there. It will have to go to specialized entity that will on top of that afford chains security. No. mate. If somehow ever btc achieve success, LN would be its undoing.



&gt;&gt;It is the way for Blockstream to position themselves as a middlemen for a fee. Kind of IFP btc style.

&gt;This is your major downfall, the crazy conspiracy theories. Blockstream don't collect fees for LN transactions, unless they run a node, obviously. I really wish I could explain to how stupid those comments are.

But it is truth and Blockstream words. They were quite clear they want to profit from being positioned as experts of LN and were supposed to be funded for their expertise. This isn't any conspiracy theory, just history. You look very stupid because it looks like you didn't know that and you will be unable to explain anything with those gaps.




&gt;&gt;Not today. Maybe tomorrow morning. Maybe afternoon.

&gt;Not for the last 2 years and the ~9 years before late 2017.

For the last 2 years chain is limited and transaction volume is just below chains capacity. From time to time it does go up, and so are fees. That kind of proves my point that this chain is not going anywhere for at least 2 years. Job done, failed chain without future.




&gt;&gt;Is that what you are going to say to the customers before shopping? Look on charts and better come back tomorrow.

&gt;&gt;Seriously?

&gt;No. (What a truly stupid comment) They're free to spend immediately from the LN channel they'll have open - since hey actually want to spent their Bitcoin and this offers the best UX for regular, daily commerce.

LOL. It was satirical comment showing how stupid your logic is. Nobody is going to look on charts to make sure they can make shopping. They will simply not use such a stupid non functional currency.

Again, using Lightning notwork they will not be free to use channels as first they will have to check they liquidity (lol) and potentially open new channel or add funds paying on chain fees. Potentially bigger than price of bread. Stupid indeed. Or they can use help of liquidity provider, like , I don't know, ..bank? Stupid af. 

LN is utterly stupid idea and there is absolutely no chance for it to be successful. Unless it will become more convenient, most likely by sacrificing more bitcoins principles.




&gt;&gt;One that proved the 1mb limit is not enough and btc is derailed chain. One that clearly limited chains usage as since then all transactions volume is continuously just below capacity limit. Adoption stopped and btc became SOV, useless speculation token.

&gt;No. See the (more than) 2 years since then.

I see, two years of stagnation of self limiting chain that is unable to enable users to use it as a currency. Is that what you wanted to highlight?





&gt;&gt;Only for rich people or ...banks?

&gt;&gt;Come on.

&gt;No. (Again with the stupid projection, I'm not saying these things)

You are not saying those things, but you are implying situations where this is inevitable.

&gt;If the vast majority of mundane daily commerce occurs in other layers the base layer is likely to remain uncontested.

But you simply can't get a grip on model functioning within other model and what correlation it will most likely have. That is why you don't have a grip and you don't get it :)




&gt;&gt;No mate. I just see you don't get it and lost focus on what bitcoin was all about.

&gt;I think I clearly understand this tech, its capabilities and more importantly Bitcoin's monetary policy than you do from your responses.

I respectfully disagree. you seems to don't see that btcs limitation prevented btc to function as a currency and its main current use is speculation. What is worse, btc can't go beyond that. It is limited and LN is not a salvation.




&gt;&gt;Tricks to mask btc is not a functional cryptocurrency

&gt;No, just functionality.

Which is not there. Even tricks don't work. Actually, they do sometimes in the mornig. If you look on the charts and plan your shopping. :) Oh dear.




&gt;&gt;It is most well known and adopted also thanks to people that moved to bch and other coins. Since then adoption stopped (even in reverse) and btc became SOV. Something we don't need. Speculators love it though.

&gt;Bitcoin is used far more than any fork of it is. Almost all of crypto is speculation at this early stage.

It is 11 fucking years and I was buying btc in 2012 in Kings Cross. Where tha fuck is bitcoin now. Nowhere. It transition into useless speculation token and nothing more.

Arachnoidosis,"I'm sure that opinion will get hated on, but I agree. It may be a huge pain in the dick if your card number gets stolen and used (and it seems that's the primary worry), but this is expressly why there are such strict protections in place for credit cards in the first place. As long as you have a reputable bank or credit union, they will halt and reverse any unauthorized charges if you catch them. You have the ability to chargeback if you get bamboozled. I literally have a credit card I expressly use for watch transactions and nothing else. It's just nice to have an isolated system to purchase stuff; I've bought four or five watches on it so far and haven't gotten it stolen yet (fingers crossed), and it's already come in handy once when I needed to threaten a chargeback on one of the watches that wound up never shipping. They were quick to issue the refund.

Bitcoin is nice to have the discount but honestly, have you considered that you're getting essentially a 95% discount on the actual cost of the watch you're getting? If that price factor is considered, it doesn't seem worth it to me to get an extra 40 or 50 bucks off the cost in exchange for a total loss if you get screwed. I don't think PureTime is actively out to scam people, but when a transaction goes tits up they have little incentive to actually rectify the situation and continue to put effort into making it right, so the end result is essentially the same.",flu6zil,2020-03-30 00:43:02,1

escobar_west,"The truth is, the world needs fiat and that will not change in our lifetime. We already had a scare decentralized unit of accounting (gold) and we abandoned it; a modern economy cannot function with a scarce unit of accounting so strongly influenced by supply and demand shocks. Regulated, manageable inflation helps to smoothen out shocks and greases the wheels of economy. Within the context of the pandemic, it's a good thing that world governments can print money and keep the economy alive.  


Printing money might be needed today, but that money stays in the economy long after the pandemic is over. If you print too much, irresponsible monetary policy leads to the erosion of trust/value in fiat, which leads to unmanageable inflation.  Imagine that you saved money your whole life, only to realize that your retirement nest is losing 10% of its purchasing power every year. This is why we need Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a hedge against irresponsible government monetary policy. If you feel that your government is printing money irresponsibly and that inflation is a risk (like in many parts of South America), then you can buy Bitcoin to protect yourself from that risk.",flzaic0,2020-03-31 10:46:00,4
JeremyLinForever,"To add to your post:

1. Gold is not divisible and fungible to the extent cryptocurrencies and BTC is.

2. We have been living in a world so long filled with inflation that this is the only rational and same thing that we know. However, what you do not know is technology is actually deflationary. See Apple, Google, Facebook, and Netflix? All these companies are arguably innovating ways to make the economy deflationary. See those barrels of oil in surplus that’s happening? It’s going to stay there because the old system is broken. Solar and electricity is going to dominate and sweep the world just like the Industrial Revolution came and swept the world in the 1900s.

3. The governments are on its last legs in keeping the economy alive. The US is printing money just to hand out to its citizens. The Democrats and Republicans are ever at odds with each other. Never have we been put in a position where a Democrat would ever propose an idea such as UBI because jobs are being replaced by robots.

This whole world pandemic is a restart for the world. A way for the world to free itself of the government and economical pressure that has been exerted on to countries for so long.

fut-,"This is a pretty thorough post - wish we had more level-headed content like this.

Personally, my beef is not with people buying silver or gold. It's that they see this as a binary choice: cash under mattress **OR** gold, nothing else - because we ""don't trust evil banks"" and all that. And so, it ends up being this ""when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail"" kind of a situation... retirement fund? Gold. Want to hedge against inflation? Buy gold! Want to bet against the US economy? Buy gold! Zombies are coming? Gold! Etc, etc.

I think this unwillingness to learn about financial instruments is actually kinda harmful. In particular, if you want to make money when S&amp;P 500 is crashing... there are straightforward products that guarantee results. Gold doesn't, it moves in fairly unpredictable ways.

There are two other things that I think are missing here. One is that the ""counterparty risk"" is not as black-and-white as you make it seem. Because most people you deal with don't know the value of gold and don't know how to authenticate it, you are generally limited to specialized markets - and these markets exist at the mercy of your government. Private ownership of gold was banned in the US for many decades; many other countries resorted to confiscations / forced exchange in the times of crisis, too. When this happens, your market shrinks, premiums go through the roof, and every trade carries serious risks. Doesn't make gold worthless, but makes it a lot less versatile. The same applies to Bitcoin, by the way; the government can't ""shut it down"", but if they put enough people in jail for using it, it's gonna reduce liquidity and depress prices pretty fast.

Finally, less so for gold, but for most other precious metals - including silver - a lot of the value is driven by industrial demand. A profound, global economic contraction can depress the prices quite a bit, just because factories no longer need nearly as much silver as the mines produce. Doubly so for less common metals, such as platinum. Gold is a bit different, in that roughly half of all demand has to do with its ""consumer appeal"".",fm2k3gc,2020-04-01 08:58:05,3

concernedcustomer33,"In August 2015, the BTC market looked a lot like it does now.  It had crashed to well below $200, after briefly peaking above $300 the month before, and was hovering around $230.  The wick down had reached a level similar to the bottom from seven months earlier, causing people to question the recovery narrative.  Many traders were shorting in expectation of further declines.  I wasn't invested in crypto at the time; as a casual market observer, I interpreted continued price weakness as evidence that Bitcoin was a failed Ponzi.  By early October, BTC had regained $250, and hasn't approached that level since.  

Does the above mean something similar will happen this time?  Perhaps not, but history often rhymes, and I think crypto is being  underestimated.  BTC isn't very flexible, but it's great in the role of scarce digital reserve asset.  While gold is the prototype of money, try keeping a significant amount of it safe, or transferring it to another party under travel restrictions.  If an orgy of fiat printing isn't good for crypto, what would be?  If governments can create as much fiat as they want without consequence, why do we pay taxes?  That's not rhetorical; more folks will ask such questions as central banks get increasingly desperate, which is bad news for the status quo.  

I'm thrilled that I'll (almost certainly) be able to earn (real!) ETH via staking in 2020.  I won't be able to move it for a while, but so what?  I'll be supporting the network, getting a good interest rate on ETH that's idle right now, and helping to kill the environmental scourge of PoW.  My theory is that large amounts of capital (both BTC and fiat) are waiting for eth2 to arrive (a long process, I know); I think the moment people perceive a production eth2 network as inevitable is when we'll see the ratio explosion.  If that happens, it will be because the fundamental market reality has changed, while simultaneously completing the pattern many of us have been expecting.

I bet cs.rin.ru admins can manage to do that! Unfortunately, relying exclusively on donations won't get you too far... maybe give you a couple of beers and a game or two...

how is the exchange done trustlessly and how does ethereums keep network which promises ""privacy"" work? zksnarks?

id like some documentation on how this works

as the article says wrapped bitcoin has been done before e.g. wBTC but requires a centralised party to mint wBTC making it out of the question for defi.

edit: did some digging [there is a whitepaper](https://backend.keep.network/whitepaper) , but i just wanted a synopsis. 

soo i went on their github and looked at the readme on some projects; found a few interesting things, though not an entire explanation.

https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc

&gt; tBTC is a trustlessly Bitcoin-backed ERC-20 token.

&gt; The goal of the project is to provide a stronger 2-way peg than federated sidechains like Liquid, expanding use cases possible via today’s Bitcoin network, while bringing superior money to other chains.

&gt; This repo contains the Solidity smart contracts and specification.



https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc

&gt; tbtc.js provides JS bindings to the tBTC system. The tBTC system is a bonded, multi-federated peg made up of many deposits backed by single-use BTC wallets to enable their value’s corresponding usage on the Ethereum chain, primarily through the minting of a TBTC ERC20 token whose supply is guaranteed to be backed by at least 1 BTC per TBTC in circulation.

finally this is the best:

https://tbtc.network/developers/tbtc-technical-system-overview

here is the first few pargarphs

&gt; 2020-04-01
tBTC incorporates novel design features that carry important implications for users. This piece explains four of these: TDT receipts, multiple lot sizes, Keep's random beacon, and threshold signatures.

&gt; TBTC Deposit Token (TDT)
The TBTC Deposit Token (TDT) is a non-fungible token that is minted when a user requests a deposit. A TDT is a non-fungible ERC-721 token that serves as a counterpart to TBTC. It represents a claim to a deposit's underlying UTXO on the Bitcoin blockchain.

&gt; TBTC deposits can be locked or unlocked. A locked deposit can only be redeemed by the deposit owner with the corresponding TDT. Each TDT is unique to the deposit that mints it and carries the exclusive right for up to a 6 month term to redeem the deposit.


my take away from this is that by using side chains that a trustless, not fedeared like liquid bitcoin sidechains sold by blockstream. it uses NFT erc-721 tokens (no two erc-271 tokens are the same) they use thse tokens it seems to extract UTXO from the bitcoin blockchain, store it in a wallet and mint it into tBTC. given this is all smart contracts, i muse that hte wallets / minting are all controlled by smart contracts. so this is a trustles way of getting a wrapped version of btc unlike wBTC which relies on a centralised company.

very cool. so um where is LN these days? i saw a graph showing that wBTC was already doing more transactions :P

looks like erc20 token trading is the way to go forward. just requires wrapping of exisitng tokens. this will get easier as time goes on",fm97js6,2020-04-03 06:33:27,4

CryptoGuard,"Yeah, my perspective is that this is the right answer.

From a currency perspective I think **Monero is still king**. It has a huge anonymity pool, solid privacy tech to back it up, and is private-by-default.

But **it has a bit of an issue when buying or selling things online as you can't doing it safely without involving a third-party**. What I mean by that is...how do you know for sure the person you send your Monero to is going to send you the item you purchased? You either need to trust the other party or ask for a third-party (and trust them too) to escrow the transaction.

This is what made me big on **Particl, which is like a sort of OpenBazaar, but private-by-default**. It's a decentralized marketplace with a two-party escrow system. It uses its own native privacy coin (PART), which uses similar privacy tech as Monero does, to settle payments but can also work with a ton of other cryptocurrencies. It has a custom implementation of RingCT that was built on the Bitcoin codebase vs the Cryptonote codebase. It also uses stealth addresses and Confidential Transactions, but that's really a detail for the point I'm trying to make.

Particl using a different codebase than Monero is the key part imo. It basically gives this ""Monero-like"" coin the ability to be used in smart-contracts and decentralized applications, which is basically what the Particl dev team did with the Particl marketplace.

But the thing is, PART, as a standalone currency, is not as private as Monero because it's not private-by-default on ALL transactions and has a smaller user base. BUT, the transactions made on its MARKETPLACE, they, on the other hand, are fully private. **A sort of sensationalistic, but actually true way to describe the marketplace would be ""the Monero of decentralized marketplaces"", as 100% of the marketplace transactions are untraceable.**

So after thinking about both Monero and Particl for, frankly, a few years now, I've come to the conclusion that **buying (or selling) something online should be done by using both coins (PART and XMR) at once if one wants to achieve the best level of privacy.**

1- You browse the Particl marketplace, find something you want to buy

2- Send in payment in Monero. You and the seller won't need to pay a fee or commission for any sale made on Particl

3- The marketplace smart-contracts receive your payment, and auto-converts it into PART.

4- The converted payment gets placed into a two-party escrow system so that neither you or the person you're transacting with can screw the other. Again, no escrow fee, no BS, 100% decentralized and trustless.

5- Seller sends you your order, you receive it, and both parties complete their end of the escrow.

You get your item, the seller gets his money, and nobody ever ran the risk of being scammed/exit-scammed/or have their funds frozen/lost.

Anyway, that's really just my two cents, but my point with this entire post is that we shouldn't be tribalistic about cryptocurrencies. **Some ""privacy coins"" aim to be the one single best and most private solution out there while some other privacy coins want to have good enough privacy but be complementary with other coins. Such is the coin with PART, a relatively strong privacy coin (but not the best) that gives utility and more functionalities to more private (and rigid, less flexible) coins like Monero or Zcash (or Arrr).**",fmc69af,2020-04-04 03:48:05,3

3. The areas where you need to pay specific attention to,

\- The wallets give you 24 words to secure.  That is the single most important master key for your funds.  It can never be on any digital media (ie. paper and pencil only, no printer etc.  Loose the 24 words and it is gone forever.

\- Dont send your product without getting paid.  There are ways where your customer can maybe try to convince you that the payment has been sent.  Beauty of Bitcoin, you can verify for yourself.  The flip side, the sender of Bitcoin doesn't have recourse, the transaction is irreversible.

\- Some customers wont know how to get BTC, but that will be a minority.  On the other hand, others that prefer to deal with BTC.

\- You'll need to figure out a way to get Fiat (Cash) for BTC - ie. how do you cash out, frequency, and through which exchange.  Through part luck/part strategy, this ended up winning Wikileaks a once in a lifetime fortune.

Even if your existing primary payment processor is intact, start offerring BTC too.  You dont need anyone's permission.  At the very least you'll be better educated for it.  Post back if you have any questions.  Stay well.",fmd91zw,2020-04-04 10:01:30,2

Mark_Bear,"Bitcoin Compared to Gold
Gold is expensive to store securely.

Gold is extremely expensive and slow to transport securely, especially large amounts.

Gold is heavy, it takes up space, it sets off metal detectors.

You can't walk very far carrying a lot of gold. You can't swim at all with more than a few coins of gold.

Gold can be confiscated. Gold has already been confiscated by the US government.

Highway robbers, corrupt border guards, pirates, and others can merely kill you, then take any gold you were transporting.

Tungsten's density is very close to that of gold. There are now gold-coated tungsten bars in circulation. It requires special equipment and know-how to detect gold-coated tungsten.

Bitcoin is easy and inexpensive to store securely.

Bitcoin is inexpensive to transport, and compared to gold, transporting Bitcoin is 'instantaneous'.

Bitcoin weighs nothing and takes up little, if any space.

Bitcoin cannot be detected and can pass right through any border or airport.

Bitcoin won't stop refugees from walking long distances, nor from swimming across rivers.

Bitcoin cannot be confiscated. Robbers, pirates, corrupt cops, soldiers, etc. won't know you own any (unless you tell them), and they cannot merely kill you and take your Bitcoin.

Red5point1,"again what a load of delusional bullshit.   
The author of the article hinges his argument on the misguided notion that the current financial system ""rests on very fragile foundations.""    
When in fact the way bitcoin has been ""used"" by the majority of its use base is more prone to react to negative news because they fear ""FUD"". The reason BTC market is so FUD sensitive is because BTC does not have any financial base to support it, the only reason it is at the current price is because of blind greedy hype.    
Hype is the only reason BTC goes up.  Which is why the community loaths FUD.   
If BTC has any real economic value then FUD would have little to no effect.   
Furthermore the author is stuck in the past where BTC was the only crypto in the market space. But that is certainly no longer true, there are hundreds of viable cryptos that are doing things better, faster, more secure and cheaper than bitcoin.    
And that is with just existing technology, there is still the mew improved tech that will eventually be invented.

I deliver custom pics &amp; videos within one week

If  you purchase a session and before/during the session something comes up  and you can't do it, I won't reschedule it or issue a refund.

If  you get rude, start to push boundaries or try to get me perform in a  way we haven't discussed prior to the session during the session, I will  stop the service without issuing a refund.

You can use GFE sexting sessions only during your GFE period. I won't reschedule them after your GFE period ends.

If you send payment for a service without getting my approval first, I will consider it as a tip and won't issue a refund.",fmi32dl,2020-04-06 00:43:02,1

On the funding question, I politely disagree - the last year or so has been spent non-stop debating how underfunded BCH development is.

The start of this fundraising campaign is the chance for holders to change that and also change the way things are done in Bitcoin Cash, for better.

BCHN is not asking for a big starting sum, we are rather following the principle of delivering first, then raising for more once we have demonstrated our ability to deliver.

AGuyNamedEddie,"u/Char1232 is right. To those who haven't been there, check out behindmlm.com. It's a great place to learn about the truly seedy underbelly of MLM. Most of the scams ""Oz"" (the blogger) covers there are straight-up illegal schemes involving pyramid- and Ponzi-type cash flows. But they almost all use the MLM model to encourage recruiting, with the same baffling payout and bonus schemes no one can comprehend. The line between them and the so-called ""legitimate"" MLM outfits is so blurred as to be nearly invisible (which is why we're all here).

What fascinates me is how many people at behindmlm make comments like, ""It's not a scam, that's just your opinion!"" 

And ""You cannot judge it from the outside! If you have not signed up, you cannot know how it works!""

Or ""Just wait, OneCoin will be the new BitCoin. I will be a billionaire by next year!""

It's sad, really. But a guilty pleasure for me nonetheless.

What is less entertaining are the people who write in having lost everything and don't know where to turn. Those are just plain sad.

I just wish Oz would learn that the past tense of ""lead"" is ""led,"" the past tense of ""plead"" is ""pled"" or ""pleaded,"" and that ""in fact"" is, in fact, two words. But don't tell him I said anything, in case (also two words, Oz) he gets angry.",fmmi4xu,2020-04-07 05:41:26,4

MrElFranko,"Whales can manipulate the circulating supply of Bitcoin, yes.
However as Bitcoin becomes more popular, the market cap grows, it becomes harder and harder to manipulate circulating supply. Because if I own 100 million dollars worth right now, it's a very large percentage of the market cap, whereas if the market cap is significantly higher, I suddenly own a much smaller percentage of the total market cap, and can't manipulate the circulating supply anymore.

PhantomFortune,"I'm not short, but I'm also not convinced what we're seeing right now is bullish. Volume isn't fitting the profile of a bullish consolidation after an upmove. With bitcoin, we're seeing above average volume on down candles, instead of a progressive decrease in volume while it moves sideways. If you take a look at eth, here is my evidence of large selling I posted in another sub:

Objectively, someone is selling a lot of eth here. If you are a trader, this would not be a bad time to take profit. Yesterday's volume: 398k eth (+20.1%). Today's volume so far: 308k eth (+0.34%)

In a strong trend, large volume creates price expansion in the direction of momentum (buying). Yesterday, perfect. Today, large volume with almost no price expansion. That is what buying into large, resting sell orders looks like.

When these price expansion/volume divergences happen, it usually means the top, or near top with a weak push higher.

edit: For bitcoin, I'm looking at 1hr. candle volume to analyze the flag it's in. For eth, I'm looking at daily candles. Bitcoin daily candles also show the same high-volume-but-no-upwards-movement phenomenon.",fmpmn6i,2020-04-08 03:19:01,6

mikkeller,"I got into Bitcoin back in 2013.  BS in Computer Science and was fascinated by it.

Became obsessed and learned everything I could about and the entire space.  I remember Ethereum gearing up for it's ICO and it was going to be like MasterCoin but better, which at the time was pretty hyped.   Ethereum was dubbed as ""programmable money"" back then which doesn't do it justice and to be honest I thought it was another crypto like Bitcoin with some ""extra features"" but I really had no idea until I got fully immersed and started really understanding what it was capable of/trying to do.   That's when it ""clicked"" for me, but it took a while for the click to happen.

Before it clicked I was a frequent in a multitude of IRC chat rooms, pump groups, and bitcoin talk and I actually bought into all the FUD and thought it was going to be a failure.  I successfully margin shorted it on Poloniex for months on end - it was like free money and I shorted it to it's all time low.

Around then I started really paying attention (or rather, doing my own research versus just listening to others) and I thought to myself... what can Bitcoin do that Ethereum can't?  Not only was the answer ""Nothing"" in fact Ethereum was exponentially more vast in what it's goal was than Bitcoin.   I saw that this was going to be one of the primary protocols for the future Machine to Machine economy and the decentralized open source movement.

At that point in time, my entire goal in trading was to increase my BTC stack.  USD value didn't concern me at all, it was all about increasing my BTC stack.  Around then (Late 2016/early 2017)  I sold my entire stack of BTC for ETH and never looked back.  My friends who were knowledgeable asked me why I did that and I said, if BTC will 10x ETH will 100x and BTC went on to 20x and ETH 200x.   The development in ETH and the growth of the community and ecosystem has surpassed my expectations related to the timeline I imagined and I believe ETH is destined for massive upside, I believe that BTC is as well, but the key to the future decentralized open source movement is in Ethereum's hand.

Doesn't mean you shouldn't hold BTC and it may outperform in smaller time spans, but long term, ETH is exponentially more valuable in it's potential that BTC, and it's pretty clear to anyone who becomes obsessed in their research and keeps an open mind.",fmr6r7z,2020-04-08 12:06:33,4

From the wallet to the network, Bisq protects your coins and you own your keys. But, if you make a transaction, the attack vector is greater than just the keys and now the transaction as well.

Using a custom implementation, hackers were able to modify the transaction used in trading and change the donation address without the transaction counting as invalid. An unsuspecting trader uses the transaction with them, and the attacker aborts leaving all the coins to go to the donation address.

1. As a soft fork, requiring a hard-fork to opt-out
2. As an  [omnibus package to push unpopular changes](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/)
3. Was designed to ""[Reduce] UTXO growth"", which is a measure proportional to adoption.

But yes, Bitcoin Cash implemented [BIP 143](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0143.mediawiki) because it actually solved an urgent scaling obstacle. Specifically, it makes large blocks safer for the network to process by solving the Quadratic hashing problem.

WittyStick,"The big mistake nearly everyone makes is attempting to value Bitcoin in dollars. The idea is absurd, but most people have not yet understood what Bitcoin is and are still trapped in a fiat mindset. The issue is that there are a potentially infinite number of dollars, and the number of dollars in existence varies from year to year, and nobody really knows how many there even are (some estimates exist, but the errors in them are potentially huge).

Bitcoin, as we know, has a finite and independently measurable upper limit. We can say that there's a Absolute Maximum Bitcoin (AMB) of 21,000,000 and a Maximum Bitcoin to Date (MBD) of ~18,500,000. This means that if I have 1 BTC, I have 1/21,000,000 AMB and I have ~1/18,500,000 MBD. Often we hear 1BTC=1BTC, which assumes 1MBD=1AMB, which will eventually be the case, but at present is close to 10% out because Bitcoin's supply is still due to inflate by nearly 10%. So 1MBD = 0.9AMB. (The distinction is important if you want to measure Bitcoin now versus Bitcoin in 2050).

Either way, since both AMB and MBD are independently verifiable, then Bitcoin presents itself as the first (and last) commodity in history whose measure of value can be expressed in terms of itself (expressed outside of itself it is priceless). It is the SI unit of value measurement against which we can objectively measure the value of any other commodity, including of course, the dollar. So what does the dollar look like when priced in Bitcoin?

https://i.imgur.com/GgPNbyx.png

Note that this chart is been adjusted for the (approximate) MBD. In essence, this chart tells you how large a share of the MBD you can purchase with a dollar over the past 10 years. Note the log scale on the Y axis. Additionally, this Y axis need never change (unlike the charts you are used to seeing, whose Y axis will continue expanding infinitely), as it covers the smallest denomination of bitcoin at which you can even exchange a dollar for it. Eventually, you will not be able to obtain *any bitcoin for your dollar whatsoever**.

\**You may be able to obtain a fraction of a satoshi through extended protocols built around bitcoin.*

This ""upside down"" chart is the one which every exchange, wallet or bitcoin service should really be displaying. The ""number go up"" chart is extremely misleading because it presents Bitcoin as something whose purpose is to try and sell at the highest dollar price, when in fact, as the chart I've just shown you tells you very clearly, Bitcoin is about getting rid of your fiat money as quickly as possible because it is *rapidly* declining in value.

You aren't ""investing"" in Bitcoin, you are divesting in fiat.

Traders are gambling in short term fluctuations of the value of the dollar.",fmv6c2o,2020-04-09 13:40:45,8

&gt;Hi Richard,  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m the person who donated over $1,000,000 USD worth of Bitcoin to FEE back in 2013.  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://fee.org/resources/roger-ver-gives-fee-highest-valued-known-bitcoin-donation-worth-about-1-million/](https://fee.org/resources/roger-ver-gives-fee-highest-valued-known-bitcoin-donation-worth-about-1-million/)  
&gt;  
&gt;Today I noticed that [https://fee.org/donate/other#bx8](https://fee.org/donate/other#bx8) only offers Bitcoin donations as an option.  
&gt;  
&gt;The thing that everyone is calling Bitcoin today isn’t the same version of peer to peer electronic cash that I donated to FEE back in 2013.  
&gt;  
&gt;Today, the tool that has the most promise to bring more economic freedom to the world is Bitcoin Cash.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bitcoin has become just a speculative instrument used by a bunch of censorship supporting statists hoping to get rich without it having any underlying utility.   
&gt;  
&gt;I humbly request that Bitcoin Cash be given as prominent or a more prominent spot in the donation area than Bitcoin.  
&gt;  
&gt;I’ll also help draw some more attention to FEE via [Bitcoin.com](http://bitcoin.com/)  
&gt;  
&gt;I’ve been a FEE fan for about 25 years when I first was gifted a subscription to the Freeman.

Ant-n,"&gt;	Bitcoin is amoral, it doesn’t care if someone was stealing anything: you sign a valid transaction, you broadcast it, it gets added to the Blockchain. Plain and simple. Morality is not part of the protocol. The entire point of mining and decentralisation is to stop this exact behaviour.

Bitcoin is amoral but Bitcoin core dev thought it was a good idea to use a anyonecanspend tx to trick old node in to following a chain they cannot fully audit.

How does that work?

To all no-Segwit aware node those transactions appear as they can be spend by anyone.

That way they could force hard fork-like and old would remain ignorant of the change.

Basically it is a hack.


BCH node don’t run segwit.

Some miner took advantage of it and tried to collect all the tx send by mistake on the BCH network.

Some other miner decided to orphan this block and replaced it by a block that returned the money to their owner.

Both transactions history is valid, 

Only some BCH miners decided to reject a block that stole users, basically they considered it invalid.



From the white paper conclusion:

&gt;	They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them.

None of that would have happen if Bitcoin core hadn’t made such a crappy upgrade.

Mkkoll,"Check the one comment on that article xD Its like a copypasta of anti-Ethereum shit flinging.

"" FYI Ethereum is not relevant to decentralized tech or field of cryptocurrencies, it’s a centralized project where they centrally premined the very thing that controls blockchains — incentives/stake/supply. There are countless altcoins and bitcoin that are losing credibility every time someone promotes an obvious scam like Ethereum or Onecoin or Bitconnect. This is shameful.""

Equivocating Ethereum to OneCoin and Bitconnect is entirely disingenuous and dishonest and anybody who posts such a thing is far too much of a zealot to be truly worth engaging with.

Also, Eth has no developers apparently. Only scammers. We'll just ignore that 1000s strong army of buidlers and business start-ups actively developing on Ethereum then. Literally thousands of scammers around here guys. Business must be good and scamming competition is fierce!",fn1emmz,2020-04-11 08:13:36,7
MeanyWeenie,Wouldn't miners and potentially all the supporting infrastructure to Bitcoin fail in a total economic collapse as well?,fn1f1wm,2020-04-11 08:17:46,4
bitusher,"&gt;in a **total** economic collapse as well?

There is never **total** economic collapses. During recessions or depressions there are always winners and losers. Mining difficulty is dynamic both ways to insure Bitcoin is always profitable for efficient miners.

If you are concerned about block subsidy being cut during the upcoming halving on mining than - 

This is the third halving and many expressed the same concerns but most of this is overblown for these reasons :

1) many miners already upgraded or transitioning to newest 5nm ASIC chips , so are more efficient for same electricity

2) Many miners have fixed electrical contracts or sunk costs in renewable power so it makes no sense to temporarily turn off ASICs until difficulty readjusts (remember difficult is dynamic both ways)

3) Price will likely go up to cover at least some of the costs of inflation drop

4) some miners simply care about Bitcoin

5) even with a significant drop in hashrate , bitcoin hashrate has grown so much over the last year we will still be much higher. To give you an idea hashrate can be cut in half and we are still at 2018 levels 

We already tested this recently due to the wuhanflu economic scares and global economic turmoil in early march with ~40% price drop (simulating what a 50% inflation cut without price increase would do ) and hashrate barely dropped.

Biggest price drop was march 12th , and when looking at hashrate I see a mere ~20% drop in hashrate that rebound to up 17% on 14th so a mere 3% drop in hashrate

It really isn't a big deal",fn1h9zo,2020-04-11 08:39:46,3

E: If this was in fact the end of the rally it would probably be the lamest bounce in this entire bear market.

spirtdica,"I'm generally inclined to agree with you about PoS being, well a PoS. After all, it is very much prone to the centralization of coin possession. PoW allows for a more egalitarian coin distribution due to its lower barrier to entry. 


The reason I find Loki intriguing is because it still enjoys some of the benefits of PoW from its hybrid approach. Furthermore, to take advantage of PoS there is a sort of service requirement; it's not enough to just lock up coins and call it a day. Loki masternodes are obliged to serve as public nodes, ensuring that there is an incentive to seed the blockchain and provide services to light wallet users. 


I'm not convinced that this approach is preferable to the likes of Monero's RPC Pay feature; but one of the problems faced by any p2p network or anonymity network is the free-rider problem. Providing an incentive to provide such services helps mitigate this issue.  For that reason I find the approach interesting and at least worthy of more investigation. 



Like you said, there are definitely drawbacks to the use of masternodes in the network architecture. There are clearly both pros and cons; my goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the trade-offs. 



Monero is focused on its application as private digital cash, which it excels at. Loki strikes me as an innovative approach at using similar cryptographic primitives to achieve a different, more open-ended role as an incentive token to promote active participation in providing privacy services. In a way I look at it somewhat like ETH; ETH is not exactly a pure financial application of public key cryptography like Bitcoin or Monero. I wouldn't consider ETH to be ""money"" because it lacks fungibility, but it is still clearly valuable due to its utility on its network. 


That's fine, because the applications of blockchain are more than just censorship resistant digital cash. But in my eyes that means that comparing Loki to Monero isn't exactly an apples-to-apples comparison even though they share many underlying cryptographic primitives",fn3dmnv,2020-04-12 00:22:41,1

MusicallyDiverse,"I'm of the *opinion* that it comes down to immediate value.. When a global pandemic and/or economic crisis hits, such as the one we find ourselves in now, people turn to their investments and liquidate the assets that don't have a ""guaranteed"" value. 

Stocks in general are much more ""established"" economically than cryptos are - in the grand scheme of things, they're barely in adolescence, and I wouldn't even say that they're THAT far yet. Stocks have been around for over a century, and there are companies who have stood the test of time. Same with physical goods, such as gold and oil (though in this instance oil is a bad example of a store of value given that everyone is locked inside, greatly restricting travel and therefore oil's necessity), these things are viewed as less likely to plummet to zero in the event of a catastrophe. 

Bitcoin has not [stood the test of time], and it has yet to truly prove itself in terms its long term value and use cases. 

All this is to say that when people either need money or fear a ""sell-off,"" they turn to the least used and/or understood assets in their portfolio. Cryptos are still too young to be seen as ""valuable and sustainable"" as some of the decades-old companies represented by the stock market. 


TL;DR 

Just my two Satoshi on this topic, fear and panic leads to people first selling what they don't fully believe in or understand, as many people don't fully believe in or understand cryptos.",fn3fmyc,2020-04-12 00:42:39,1

Yes

&gt;He was arguably the most prolific cypherpunk on the original mailing list, with over 700 posts.

Bullshit and who cares, Adam Back never did anything of any real relevance. He made an implementation of some work done 5 years prior by real academics, that doesn't make him a ""cypherpunk""

&gt;Bitcoin likely wouldn't exist without him. 

LOL, Satoshi only gave a passing reference to that clown, literally none of Adam's work is actually in the code, Adam was offered a chance to help and turned it down, because he is an idiot. He then used that reference to con venture capitalists into funding his corporate toolbox.

&gt;The next most prolific cypherpunk would be Nick Szabo, who has published hundreds of influential articles and also created BitGold, which was VERY similar to Bitcoin.

I cant entirely disagree on that

&gt;Adam Back and Nick Szabo have both publicly criticized BCH so unfortunately their names have been virtually erased from the history books on this sub. They are either ignored entirely or dragged through the mud by some new user who has no idea how important their contributions were. Bitcoin doesn't exist without Adam Back (Hash Cash) and Nick Szabo (BitGold). Plain and simple.

Ad-hominems are not an argument, how typical you use ""new redditor"" to justify ignoring the content. I know Bitcoin's history deeply and have studied it for 8 years now, and I who contributed what, and I know who decided to form a hostile troll group.  I dont kiss Adam Backs ass because *he didnt contribute much, not one line of code in Core, NOTHING*, he's another lying assclown like everyone else in his shitty VC sponge of a company. 

Adam Back did worse than just critisize, he openly attacked and trolled and still does. Szabo decided to side with the buttcoiners, unfortunate, even smart people can be morons.",fn45kzu,2020-04-12 04:48:34,1

FaustianBargainHunt,"I'm exhausted and don't know what to do. Last week my dad, who's in his late sixties, apparently spent $10,000 to buy bitcoin from some guy who phoned and claimed to work at a bitcoin brokerage firm. He didn't tell my mum until a few days later, and was sure he was going to make like $50k in profit from it. My mum was furious and they had a big argument, and he promised he would never do it again. The 'broker' phoned back today and my dad spent three hours on the phone with him and ended up buying another $10,000 worth of bitcoin. And it's money my parents really don't have - it came out of their mortgage.

My mum called me in tears this afternoon about it, saying she didn't know what to do. I called my dad and tried to reason with him, and he was sure he would get rich from it and I told him that even if bitcoin went back to an all time high, at most he would make $5k. So he agreed to try cancel the second purchase.

Then as I was getting ready for bed I decided to look up the company and it turns out it's a big scam. Some guy based in Hungary (who lied and said he was based in the UK). So I called my dad and told him and he doesn't know what to do. And so I called his bank, and it's too late to reverse the second transaction, and the best they can do is try get the funds back if the receiving bank will cooperate. But now it seems hopeless and I'm scared for my parents, and for the sake of their relationship, and for my dad's mental health going through this. But what hurts the most is my sister and I had been saving money to try give them $10k as an anniversary/birthday present to help pay down the mortgage, and we both have decent jobs but hardly earn a lot. And it makes it so hard to justify saving money for them when dad just gets these stupid ideas and impulsively spends $20k on apparent bitcoin from some guy on the phone, without even checking that it's real. I just don't know what to do and I'm furious with him but also just need to help them and don't know how.",fn9rrjk,2020-04-13 22:01:36,524

darmon,"value added tax, is a regressive tax, meaning it disproportionately affects those with less money than those with money, and it is a retail sales tax, meaning everyone pays it at the time of retail sale.  So on luxury items like a PS4, there would be a large VAT $ associated.  That is you paying into the social programs of your country, because you purchased something that vast swaths of the country you're in could not afford whatsoever.

Instead of taxing the rich directly, which is impossible because they have entirely captured the political and social and legislative and media frameworks, which would raise MUCH MORE MONEY and alleviate oppressive inequality, we tax the people who demonstrably have no agency, political power, or social clout, who buy stuff,  for the act of buying stuff, which is easy to accomplish politically.

But more to your question: how do we pay for it?  How do we pay for anything?  Where does ANY money come from?  Any money.  One whole buck.  Where does it get born into the universe?  I grow tomatoes, you raise sheep, that guy builds barns, and that lady designs our respective websites: who, where, is injecting the dollars into this situation?

UBI is a dramatic REIMAGINING.  AS SUCH, you have to use your imagination!  Hard, given that our society has systematically, deliberately undermined the social ability to imagine alternatives to this system, INTENTIONALLY, for GENERATIONS.

Where does money come from?  tomatoes, farms, sheep, computers, these are real - kilometers, kilowatts, kilograms, these are real - is money real?  Money is a paleolithic attempt to quantify the universe we live in, the Earth we are on, and our relationships to each other, ALL AT ONCE, WITH A SINGLE VARIABLE.  It's like a catch all ""X"".  Exchanging spaceship parts for groceries?  money.  Exchanging oil for the watts to run a PC to farm bitcoin? money.  exchanging your lived hours, + your labor, to an employer for their projects? money. paying for the expenses of a loved ones funeral rites? money.  getting married? money.  having a baby? money.

To think that a single variable can/should/will indefinitely carry out every physical exchange in the cosmos is.... paleolithic.

UBI is a way to DEMOCRATIZE AND UNIVERSALIZE AND DECENTRALIZE the monetary creation mechanisms.

Instead of the current model: simply do nothing politically your entire life, while bequeathing the oligarchs, through tacit allowance, the capacity to create the currency with which they impose their oligarchy.

Think about it.  They are all in power.  They conspire, hey, tomatoes for spaceship parts applied across the distance between say, England and Peru, hey that's super um complicated how about we use a stand in note?

Bing bang boom oh hey look the illegitimate systems that had the oligarchs in power since time immemorial, can be draped in the appearance of their being ""gone,"" thanks to our totally fair monetary system,™ which is totally more legit than what we were doing before (feudalism, perpetual war, other essentially paleolithic shit) we can launder our hegemony, and at the end say hey look we're still in power. Fucking plebs won't know what hit them.  We can buy them, with their OWN political power, for ""pennies"" on the ""dollar!""

The reality is, if we affix the price, the true price, of every consumer good on the planet, every industrial good on the planet, every transaction, in terms of CO2 contributed to the atmosphere/coast line lost/population displaced/toxic waste spills/indentured workers, the price on a pack of gum would be a trillion dollars, no one living could afford a single thing anyplace, and the system would irrevocably grind to a halt.

That is what it means to be living in a system that is wholly illegitimate.  That is what it means, to be living in a system where every transaction is illegitimate, not because of what is being transacted, but because deliberate shortcomings of the MONEY SYSTEM as exchange mechanism. Everything is influenced by it, and corrupted by it.  We need to stymie the corruption, with decentralized, adaptive, resilient, technocratic solutions that make our immediate communities more productive and more stable INTERNALLY, in models that are entirely new.

Imagine UBI in partitions.  It's not about ""where does the money come from?"" it's about ""what are we trying to quantify/signify/control?""

SHOULD we use our monetary system to exact and/or influence certain behaviors from people?  Isn't that highly immoral and antithetical to the recognition of individual rights of autonomy and movement?

So what are we trying to innumerate?  Bodies, their actions, their needs, their history, their future.

If money is paleolithic, it is the god damn 21st century!  We need a ""money 2.0"" and UBI gets us closer to that.

Do you guys think the people buying bitcoin now are really strapped for cash? And would panic sell in case there food shortages like some have been saying? I know there are still dumbasses in this market who invest money they can’t afford to lose. But I don’t think that part of the retail buyers are the majority now, most of them have been flushed out during the 2017-2020 bear market. We’ve already capitulated twice down to 3k/4k, and the jump has been strong. The people buying now are the ones who have extra cash to do so. Remember only 1% own bitcoin in this world, I highly doubt the majority who are holding now are people who desperately need cash. 

Those people have sold in the last few weeks. Also we’re starting to see death toll drop in Italy.

But that also means we shouldn’t expect too many buyers. Seems like a the perfect condition for a very long sideways movement, as the economy also need time to recover.

Also another thing to consider - bitcoin was born out of a financial crisis back in 2008 - Satoshi fundamentally didn’t trust the central bank. That narrative could reignite twelve years later when it’s seemingly more relevant.

""I don't think 1 MB is optimal. Block size is a compromise between scalability of transactions and verifiability of the system. A system with 10 transactions per day that is verifiable by a pocket calculator is not useful, as it would only serve a few large bank's settlements. A system which can deal with every coffee bought on the planet, but requires a Google-scale data center to verify is also not useful, as it would be trivially out-competed by a VISA-like design. The usefulness needs in a balance, and there is no optimal choice for everyone. We can choose where that balance lies, but we must accept that this is done as a trade-off, and that that trade-off will have costs such as hardware costs, decreasing anonymity, less independence, smaller target audience for people able to fully validate, ...

Now this is all worthless simple math, but for shits and giggles, let’s assume bitcoin takes over all money supply, .003btc = $8-10K.

.78/.003 = 260. 260 X $8,000 = $2,080,000

Noobie678,"Ah yes, Planet Entertainment finally gets their due. Covid-19 shit aside, their downfall was inevitable but it should've been a lot sooner. [I remember when they first launched in January 2019](https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blockchain-based-game-publisher-planet-digital-partners-launching-with-former-nintendo) I thought investors were gonna laugh them out the room and shoot the baby in the crib. But alas, as I've learned with other disasters like Fyre Festival and WeWork, *Rich people are fucking idiots* most investors aren't like those guys on Shark Tank. 

You can convince dumb multi-millioniares to invest in your startup restaurant franchise where all you serve is literal dog shit on paper plates [as long as your video pitch has decent infographics and include the words ""block chain""](https://youtu.be/wp1hR-8YaBs).


EDIT: Im sick of the people and Twitter ""journalists"" that keep peddling the ""the game turns your Switch into Bitcoin mining machine!!"" myth because it ignores the scam these thugs in suits just pulled. You guys need to understand what this peak bourgeois degeneracy looks like.

To start a business you need capital, some get it in the form of bank loans, some get it by privately or publicly selling shares of their company (stock market).
So these parasites at Planet Digital chose making their own cryptocurrency and selling it like stock.

&gt;Planet Digital’s asset is the Rocket Token (RKT.) The platform will have a security token offering during the first quarter of 2019. There will be 50 million tokens, and the platform will run on the Ethereum blockchain.
&gt;
&gt;The project plans to sell around 38 million tokens in this initial offering, **with the leftover 12 million going to the team members, advisors, and other relevant parties.** Token prices will start at $1 each.

[Now take a moment to laugh at the current token value](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rocket-fund) but there's more! If you look at the chart on that site (click on ""Price"" then ""Max"") you see its peak back in November at around $20 a token. (Actually the peak was even higher last April but it's probably because of another leak)

Now let's go back about a month ago, [a trailer for the game dropped and there was thread in the Switch subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/f5rqvb/cooking_mama_switch_announcent_trailer) the video was removed so I can't link it, but according to the comments in that thread some people noticed that the video was originally uploaded back in November but it was delisted until March. That video was most likely the ""vertical slice"" for their ""tokenholders"" and Office Creates. All that block chain language in that vertical slice probably got those tokenholders dicks hard and bought more tokens. The executives at Planet knew Office Creates wasn't gonna give them the pass, so they bailed while the tokens were still high and that was when shit started getting scrubbed from the web.

Planet claims they started with 12 employees, remember when they said they were gonna keep 12 million tokens? Let's assume it was split evenly. So the tokens were initially sold for $1/token, if all of them did infact bail on November 2019 when the tokens were worth $20/token.....easy math here guys, these cretins made $20 million each, cut off all ties with the company (Planet's LinkedIn is empty) and are currently quarantining in  their penthouses while they watch in ridicule as Office Creates sues what is essentially a semi-empty burning house at this point.",fngl4bq,2020-04-15 16:29:00,185

A few years ago, I was living paycheck to paycheck despite working full time and to get out of it, I started driving for Lyft, selling plasma, and doing paid surveys/research studies so I could save money to move closer to work and have money to spend for thing to make life somewhat enjoyable.

I drove for Lyft from March 2018 till the beginning of November 2018 when I got into a wreck and totaled my car. I then had to live without a car until I moved to the city and while I was able to make it work, it was still rough as fuck. I had to plan everything out unless it was in walking distance or if my friends gave me rides. I did have the option of taking Lyfts/Ubers but that would have added up and kept me from being able to save. I eventually moved to the city last year in October which made  everything a lot better in terms of getting around, but then shit happens and now Im stuck inside my apartment till who knows when.

But after my car wreck, I had people (who were  also in tough positions themselves)  tell me that it's my fault for not having 10K saved for a new car. It's like motherfucker, if I  had that much, would  I be doing these things in the first place?

Others said, it's my fault for not having a better job and it's also my fault for going to the bar on the weekends and having a few PBRs when I should be investing in bitcoin and retirment instead.

Please come back and share your thoughts if you have time.

To be honest, I'm not really sure what it means, but perhaps it suggests that China sees the importance of public blockchains, and realizes that if they want to have a relevant digital currency *outside* of China, they need to be able to interoperate with and compete with assets on public blockchains.

And for such economically important applications, what blockchain is more important than Ethereum? This Tweet and the linked Tweet from yesterday (talking about how the magnitude of overall value transfer on Ethereum has just reached parity with Bitcoin) summarize my view:

hungryforitalianfood,"Miners are getting half the btc for the same amount of work. Their costs haven’t come down. Therefore, they won’t be willing to sell btc for the same price they were selling it for pre halving. The market will eventually realize the inefficiency and adjust. 

Pretend you work at the Apple store (I haven’t eaten yet today and this is gonna be weird but bear with me) and instead of money, you’re paid in product. Let’s say you get four iPhones a month for your full time job. You’re able to sell those iPhones for an average of $750 each, netting you $3,000 a month in pay. 

However, starting next month your pay will be cut in half to two iPhones per month. With the current market price of $750 each, you simply can’t survive on the $1,500 a month that two iPhones will bring. You have two choices. 

One, you list the iPhones for sale but you ask for more money. You saw this coming so you’re prepared to continue working and you won’t sell an iPhone until the price comes up. The more employees that do this, the sooner the price will go up. 

Two, you determine you can’t afford to continue working at the Apple store, so you quit. (I know it’s been weird so far, but here’s where it gets really weird.) In the bitcoin world, option two magically means that it’s now easier for all the other Apple employees to do their job. They still only make half of the rate they used to, but they can now stay on pace for two iPhones a month with a 38 hour work week instead of a 40 hour work week. Another few employees quit? 32 hour work week. It keeps getting easier the less ~~~miners~~~ employees there are.

SloppySynapses,"It's when you borrow an asset with the intention to sell it and then buy it back later at a lower price and then give it back after buying at the lower price.

e.g.

I have 1 bitcoin at $10,000. You ask to borrow it at $10k, I say ok, here you go. Once you have it, you sell it. price goes to $5,000. You buy it back for $5,000.

You now have $5,000 leftover and give me my 1 bitcoin back. You made $5,000 since you only had to pay 50% of what you sold it for in order to give back to me what you borrowed.

That's a successful short. an unsuccessful one is where you borrow it, sell it at $10k, price goes to $20k, and you have to give it back still. You buy it back at $20k and give it back to me. You're now down $10,000.

Jerfov2,"No, there’s a reason they’re called Proof of WORK algorithms. The point of mining is to decentralize authorizing transactions and creating new currency, by randomly rewarding miners proportional to how much work they do, so that no one actor can control the network unless they do at least 51% of the work. The reason Monero is “ASCI-resistant” is because of the TYPE of work that the Monero miners do. For example, the algorithm for Bitcoin is SHA-256, which is incredibly easy to make specialized computers for. But Monero uses an algorithm called RandomX, which is super convoluted and very difficult to make a specialized computer for. So you can always make an algorithm less “specializable”, but as long as PCs are faster than phones, PCs will be able to mine faster than phones. Hope that helped!",fnnkltf,2020-04-17 12:36:25,7

Spend *and replace* is a good strategy.",fnqf7vd,2020-04-18 07:43:50,4
derykmakgill,"I understand his feeling but I think he's wrong here.

**1/ The 'velocity of money' is a long-standing economic fallacy that has been used for decades to justify currency debasement, artificially low interest rates, etc etc etc.**

There is no \*ideal\* velocity of money other than the one that is constantly in flux on a free-market. I agree BTC is artificially slow velocity and it crippled a ton of businesses, but BCH has open blocks and velocity there is a function of all sorts of individual, rationally self-interested preferences. There's simply no reason to worry about that.

And telling people they should spend money they would otherwise save in order to support a particular business is a nice social cause, but understand that all we're encouraging is individually forgoing capital accumulation now and potential future investment to save someone else's \*failing\* investment now. There is no having your cake and eating it too.

Money spent now in supporting a business is potentially less money you can spend on another business in the future.

**2. Bitcoin Cash IS a deflationary currency.** We all signed up for that but sometimes people don't seem to like the implication. Deflationary currency discourages conspicuous consumption and incentivises holding cash for future dates. That's the deal so we should expect more intelligent buying habits.

That doesn't mean \*don't spend\* like the Core idiots say. It doesn't mean limit the block size. It means follow the incentives and seek profit. If you can forgo spending \*now\* so you can spend more at a future date, do it! If you can spend now and make more money on that spending than the future, do it!

**3. Buy and replace is silly.** Many of the benefits of Bitcoin Cash are lost when you purchase it on exchanges. This includes privacy, low fees, added tax liabilities, withdrawal times, account setup, etc. For example, if we assume a 1 cent transaction fee for BCH, then we can see that buying BCH on Coinbase to spend literally means a 100% or more fee markup when all is said and done. That sucks. Combine that with tax liabilities and it really sucks.

I spend Bitcoin Cash all the time, probably more than most people. I buy domains on Namecheap, pay contractors, buy gift cards on eGifgter (except now I can't buy baby diapers with Target giftcards. Bastards), but I wouldn't do it nearly as much if I first had to buy it on an exchange. I'm lucky I've been in a different position and don't need to do that, so I get the full benefits.

The reality is most people are not earning BCH now unfortunately. If that changes, expect more spending. But encouraging people to lose extra money in order to use Bitcoin doesn't work (Purse was a neat exception because they offered such steep discounts, but clearly it wasn't enough).

This is one of the reasons Hayden's work in Austalia is so useful. He's helping onboard people by earning it.

**4. Appealing to people's altruism is a bad strategy.** Ultimately a business needs to be able to market itself and its products so well that people want to part with their money. This is 10x harder when people expect the price of the money to go up in the future, but its still possible. It just raises the standards quite a bit.

&gt;Satoshi Nakamoto himself went on to argue in favor of a decentralized system in which users validate their own transactions, then dropped his famous “If you don’t believe me or don’t get it, I don’t have time to try to convince you, sorry”

But that's the exact opposite of what Satoshi said in the quote pictured in the article! Satoshi argues...

&gt;The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.

Not only that, but the guy Satoshi was replying to was arguing that Bitcoin can't scale and we'll need Bitcoin banks (sounds a lot like Core). He wasn't arguing for raising the block size, he was arguing for second layer.

If you are, there are other issues, but if you believe the market goes up, then you are timing it. Your time span is just very long. If you are shorting, you are timing the market in a short-term time span.

This makes no sense at all.  If DCA and periodic investing is timing the market, literally every single person is timing the market any time they invest.  It would be impossible to not time the market.

&gt;I cringe when I go back and read some of the shit I wrote about Bitcoin back in 2017. I learned that I know nothing, and if I am wrong about thinking things could get worse now, I will take it in stride and accept that I lose money. What I will not do is make fun of others and act like I know it all. Because I don't. And I never will.

And this is actually hilarious.  So ""woke"", yet so unaware.  I see a ""I cringe thinking about my market timing post"" in a few years.",fntvxkw,2020-04-19 07:40:21,2
ludwigvonmisess,"The title, abstract, and content of the original paper, plus everyone in the original community, all clearly stating that Bitcoin is for payments doesn't count. 

Neither does the fact that in order to stop the founder, original developers, and original community, a massive, multi-site, well-documented and heavily down-voted censorship campaign had to be initiated and sustained over years.

Neither does the fact that the obvious backers of this censorship and re-writing of history have a clear financial incentive to strangle Bitcoin's capacity to sell their own products.

To prove how ineffective these lawmakers will be, I put this video demo of some software I wrote. It lets you encrypt a message and send it to someone using Bitcoin Cash. There isn't a damn thing any state actor can do to stop the communication or break the encryption. Bitcoin does not respect laws.

~~Use the above method to cheat at bridge~~

Try to connect to Satoshi Nakamoto. Sure, that's not their birth name, but it's *a* name, connected to a person we know as much about as many obscure historical figures.

If they're dead they might be willing to give you the key to the giant early bitcoin stash (or another more modest bitcoin stash, since it's quite plausible the key to the big one was just lost) and/or enough evidence to demonstrate their identity, in exchange for fame or your promise to use some of that money for whatever posthumous desire they may have.

If they're alive, you might be able to blackmail them for same, if they wish to remain anonymous and you can bluff that you have evidence to unmask them. Possibly you can uncover that evidence the hard way if you get enough information about them during the conversation to direct your investigation.

giddycheesecake,"I'd argue that substantial fractional reserve would be caught by now, because we saw huge bank runs on tether in the past. But I don't have any numbers, so let's assume you're correct and it wasn't. My argument is still about price inflation.

Let's say tether prints 1m fake tethers and buys bitcoin in tether/btc pair, then sells in usd/btc. They sell, because they want usd, not bitcoin. They earned \~1m in usd, which they spend frivolously, accrued 1m in liability in tether and suffered some minor losses, because of people arbitraging between tether/btc and usd/btc pairs. How does that inflate bitcoin price, they sold as much as they bought after all? Supply/demand for bitcoin did not change, maybe the velocity, but it does not increase prices long term.

Additionally, they can only do that so many times, as at some point they will reach 50% (or whatever percentage) reserves and it's unsafe anymore. Unless market is always booming and their 50% is always larger amount tomorrow, which is not true, as, for example, last may bitcoin price was 3k+ and many tether holders probably redeemed and left.",fnvjghq,2020-04-19 20:26:23,1

heySheryl,"With regards to the draft, I did get off the hook in the end after being officially diagnosed. Gender dysphoria is already enough and surprisingly, so is autism/ aspergers. 

Well it was a long story. I was already consciously aware of myself and the difference, even as early as high school. At that age, I was already floating the idea of how to get out of the draft. It was a huge motivating factor for me to make as much money as I can before college ends. In my mind, I just want to get out of the country as soon as possible. That's it. A plan thought out years ahead.   
Adding to the fact that my thinking patterns are just so logical being on the autistic spectrum, national propaganda rarely ever worked on me from a very young age without me questioning it deeply. I was already an atheist by middle school despite not knowing the actual word at all, and my parents have almost 0 influence on me in terms of religion too.  It was just so easy for me to see through the lies in the rather collective society that I live in, a good lie on history that keeps most people together and united.   
*Majority of people stick together and look to others for social cues because biologically it is always the safest way to navigate life, and it makes sense in the hunter-gatherer life during the early stage of human evolution. Those that went on themselves are probably eaten and thereby eliminated through natural selection.*    


With that in mind, it actually turns out to have a huge impact later in my life, as I invested most of my teens in my career &amp; my special interest more. Probably just occasional partying &amp; socialising once a month.  
I didn't go through the regular education route, surfing through high school &amp; tertiary education just barely passing. School was never about learning anything to me, it was always a legal way for me to delay the draft while I am still building my financials. So I'm mostly just a borderline pass-er in exams, or sometimes seen as a 'drop-out' because I had to purposely fail exams to be retained for a year.   


At about 17 I was already operating an online business as a software programmer with profits of up to 30k USD a month. Also found out about cryptocurrencies at the same time (7 years ago), and bought + traded bitcoin, and invested a lot of my time in learning to invest/ trade my proceeds too.   
 *(software programming &amp; trading the markets is all logical work and 0 emotions and its one of the most natural way I can express my thoughts most effectively being autistic.)*  
By now I'm kinda already set for life, more than what I can ever ask for this lifetime to the point where retirement isnt even a thing that I have to worry already. Programming, and contributing to open source codes online for free + trading the financial markets right now is just a past-time.  
 

After going through all these emotional trauma over the years, I honestly no longer feel anything to my country of birth anymore. Even hearing the name of the country disgust me so much.  Despite already being off the hooks, I am still making it a life goal right now for me to live aboard and settle elsewhere.   


Its quite odd how life turns out, despite the difficulties early on in my life. Being autistic, and the environment (a collective/ an authoritarian country) was actually the determining factor to my success. If I am able to go through life once again, I'll still take the rough path over and over again.   
\-----------------  
Yes I did freeze my sperm aboard 2 years ago 'just in case' before I started HRT. Fertility will still come back when I stop HRT though, but it will take over 3\~6 months for viable sperm to be produced again. *(This is something that some trans are unwilling to accept, as going off estrogen can be quite traumatizing emotionally, add on top of the slight masculinization during the few months.)*  
My hopes for parenthood are quite high, although I admit I still have a lot to work on emotionally before being able to commit to any relationship 😀 Human to human relationship just don't come naturally to me, I have to work my way out and learn it.   


\-----------------  
Think of the times when you spend learning new things, it is frustrating isnt it? It seems to be the default mode of thinking for me regardless most of the time, I feel that it is why it seems to be quite logical from the surface. However, it is only because I'm going through so much more to come to any conclusion rationally. I'm still emotional like anyone else, but it is suppressed.

That surely also comes at a cost, when I get so drained at the end of the day when heading to events like parties. I just need a few days or a week to recharge at home. It was sort of a mask, despite the fact that I seems to appear normal just as everyone else in the room.

GoneGaltUSA,"/u/hblask is right, but I won't fault anyone for holding some BTC. Everyone has their reasons.

Speaking of which, I have a story about that...

Back in 2015 when I first got into Ethereum and was mining ETH heavily, I also started buying it directly somewhere around $2 in early (Jan/Feb) 2016.

That was about 6 months before Coinbase listed it and the only way you could buy ETH then was with BTC on places like Poloniex, etc.  So, I had to do crazy stuff like use localbitcoins to purchase BTC with cash in order to buy ETH with it, before I finally got my Coinbase account setup and approved.

And I remember thinking back then, ""BTC is such garbage (it was and still is), it's so obvious Ethereum is the future...""

And I was so eager to dump that $400 BTC for $2 ETH. And to this day, that was the right move.

But the past 2.5 years have been hell for everyone, especially ETH holders who didn't have the luxury of getting in on sub-$1 or single-digit ETH.  Additionally, the past 2.5 years has proven to me that no matter how ""right"" one might be about something, a market's irrationality can turn that on its head.

Having now seen and lived through all of that first-hand, I've since realized that holding a little BTC isn't the end of the world. As such, I bought plenty BTC when it dipped back into the $3k range in early 2019. I see it more as a bet on ignorance (not to be too harsh) and irrationality, as all signs clearly point to Ethereum consuming everything, including Bitcoin. Yet somehow, BTC market cap persists (maybe for not much longer, but we'll see).

I guess my point in all of this is ... do what you feel is best, but definitely try to be objective about it, because things have a way of turning out in unexpected ways. And one way to help mitigate the risks of those unexpected outcomes, is with diversification, even if just a little. 👍",fnwmlg7,2020-04-20 03:34:32,2

TribeHasSpoke,"There was a period of about a month a couple years ago in here, when the subreddit was much smaller than it is today ([https://subredditstats.com/r/billsimmons](https://subredditstats.com/r/billsimmons)) when the sub strangely became filled with pro-Bill posts and typical posts making in fun of Bill were immediately being downvoted. Because a) the sub back then was more anti-Bill than it is today (more long-time Bill fans before) and b) was smaller so you knew what posts would and wouldn't do well, something was clearly up and several of the top commenters on here each came to that conclusion on their own. Something seemed off, especially because a number of the new accounts posting pro-Bill content were new or hadn't been active for awhile.

So we thought something was up, and then one major and influential contributor to subreddit said he was messaged on here to promote pro-Bill content in exchange for bitcoin. He attempted to go through with the deal just to see what was up, but IIRC was never sent the bitcoin.

UsernameIWontRegret,"Not necessarily about Ethereum but I was reading the Bitcoin whitepaper again. 

&gt;Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. **The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions**, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services. -Satoshi Nakamoto 

When will BTC Maxis come around and accept that Bitcoin has failed its vision? I read that bit and I couldn't help but be struck by the irony of it all. The very thing that criticized traditional finance for high fees and unsuitability for small transactions has become known for its high fees and unsuitability for small transactions. 

I really just don't see the value of Bitcoin. It's not functionally unique. It's not like Ethereum. Ethereum offers unique functions. Everything built on the Ethereum blockchain can only be accessed through Ethereum. Bitcoin could disappear tomorrow and the only people who would care would be the people who were expecting to make money off of it. If the only function of it is to increase in value, then that's just a massive scam, not something practical. You can't use it, and it doesn't do anything better than something else.",fnx6f9z,2020-04-20 06:39:54,4

ThomasZander,"&gt; So a little nitpick but it's not the Bitcoin Cash mempool that has inherent limits, it's specific implementations that have these limits.

Absolutely.

The Bitcoin Core people almost seem like they really want to design a system that CAN NOT scale, and all parts of their software stack represent that. I mean, who on earth puts 100% of the tools (validation, wallet, indexing, block-template for mining)  in one application! And as a bonus it effectively is completely single-cpu.

The point I'm making is that good scaling software is going to need to take a hard look at architectural decisions made by the Bitcoin Core devs (and blindly copied by ABC). The mempool is one of them, its just stupid design.

Another major advantage of bitcoin as a currency is that it is also incredibly volatile and neither my employer will pay me in bitcoin nor any service I might conceivably need will allow me to pay using bitcoin - drastically reducing my ability to spend it and thus saving me an indeterminate amount of money depending on whether buttcoin has any value in future which is completely unknown.  
I would also say that another advantage of buttcoin is that as a payment processing service it is great because it supports the wider economy by being slow and costly but also more importantly it is also outrageously energy inefficient helping drive global electricity demand which is good for both renewables and coal demand.",fo4hmz9,2020-04-22 06:29:43,5

cdazzo1,"As long as the Fed can print unlimited amounts of dollars, there is no threat of a ""hard"" default.  The threat is a ""soft"" default aka devaluation.

The generally accepted inflation rate has been 2-3%.  We don't have to debate whether this is true or not, the important part is that people and countries think it is.  

So put yourself in their position.  Assume your bank started to charge you interest for holding money there (analogous to USD losing value to other nations).  When do you withdraw your money?  I would pull my money out when I could find a cheaper safe alternative to store my money.  And I'm such a high roller that the logistics of dealing with cash are impractical (I wish!).  I could put my money in bitcoin (assuming it were 100% safe), but it's not universally accepted so I'd have to constantly exchange it which is annoying and can cost money.  I could buy gold, but like cash the logistics are very difficult.

Countries are in an identical situation.  They can't easily spend their domestic currency.  They can't easily spend other foreign currencies.  And even if other countries agree to accept it, they need an international clearing house to handle the transaction (like SWIFT) because physical currency is impractical.  Gold is also impractical for the same reasons.  

These are **expensive** and somewhat risky options when compared to 2-3% cost of holding dollars.  You would need:

1. A currency cheaper to hold than the dollar (less inflated)
2. A currency safer than the dollar (more trustworthy nation issuing it)
3. A currency with enough issuance to be used globally (global usage as reserve currency wouldn't destabilize it)
4. \*\*A world super power.  There is a more abstract aspect of this that relates to military strength and the role the US has assumed as the world's police force.  The ability to do that is intertwined with our ability to print money and being the world's reserve currency.  You'd need another nation to assume that role.

I would never say never.  But you need something monumental to make this happen.  The COVID spending shouldn't hurt us here because every other issuer of currency is doing something similar.  All currencies will take a hit.

nassergg,"A bull trap is when very optimistic traders, coming off of years of inflated prices refuse to believe that the stock market will go lower, despite some of the worst macro economic news EVER. This happens during bubble bursts, look at bitcoin and weed stocks, now we are transitioning to bursting the streaming bubble. But they all experience big bounces once they hit near bottom, and die hard bulls, or those waiting on the sidelines for a “more reasonable entry point” think the bounce signals a full recovery, usually blinding themselves to reality. It’s hard to know it’s a real bull trap until it falls again back to previous lows...so this could be a trap, or a recovery, but valuations for Netflix are inflated based on their net income versus other similar tech stocks...so this is likely a bubble burst.

Most bulls get trapped because they don’t actually know how to value a company as it transitions from hyper growth to a steady state and now needs to transition from buying new customers to making and maintaining profits - in the background of shit macro situation. So a lot of people act simultaneously and drive the price back up. Experienced investors watch the bull trap play out and try to sell again at the top of the false rebound. I’m not betting on NFLX either way just FYI.

Right now the consensus is probably that it’s only down from here for Netflix as quarantine ends. You have to dive much deeper into way NFLX didn’t increase their net income by more to know if they can go a lot higher.

Happy_Pizza_,"Hello everyone!  I [saw this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/g5ubjf/daily_discussion_wednesday_april_22_2020/fo7gdca/) by u/Ordinary_investor and had to make a post on it.  

Investor thinks that the idea of 140k bitcoin is ridiculous, but personally, I 100% agree with u/wardser that these prices are quite realistic.

Let's think about where the bottoms of the bitcoin bubbles are relative to the previous tops.  The first bubble top was 32, and the second bubble bottom was 174, roughly 5x the previous top.  The second bubble top was 1k, and the third bubble bottom was 3k, roughtly 3x the previous top.

So,  if we **1)** assume the bottom of the next bubble will be higher than the top of the previous cycle, and if we **2)** assume that the bottom will come after an +80% decline, then we can get a rough estimate of the top of the next bubble.  Since the top of the previous bubble was 20k, then the next bubble will almost certainly be over 100k.

If the bottom of the next cycle will be 2x the top of the previous cycle, that would leave us with a bottom of roughly 40k.  If 40k is 20% of the top, that means the top is around 200k.

An estimate of 150-200k also [lines up with the stock to flow model advocated by Plan B.](https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)  

It also lines up with other historical bubbles.  200k bitcoin would give bitcoin a market cap of about 4 trillion dollars, and the dot com bubble was 6.2 trillion dollars.

So at the end of the day, if you assume that bitcoin will have another bubble, and if you assume that bubble will be similar to the previous two bubbles, then 200k is perfectly reasonable.  This lines up with theoretical models that others have proposed and puts in the ballpark with other historical bubbles.  u/wardser's estimate of 140k to 200k is on the nose.

And since Ordinary_investor tried to make his point using a diagram, I'll make my point using my own diagram.

Merlin560,"PNF Update

I was holding off a little this morning to watch.

We broke out a few minutes ago.  It is a double top break out.  there have been several of those in this formation, so lets not get too excited yet.

The current formation is 13 columns wide.  This indicates some pressure behind the formation and break out.  Using the width as a target, we would go up 13 boxes from the break out--which puts us at $7900 for a high end.  The second way to estimate a high target is to look at the last breakout which was 15 boxes high.  This puts the second target at $7,500.

These targets are ""30 day"" ranges, and bitcoin usually falls in the middle part.  Remember, these charts are for swings, not day trades.  They are for setting ""trigger points and ranges.""  These trigger points are usually pretty good.  But, sometimes the movements are fast so scalp what you can and save your profits.

Long term, they are great at providing direction.

Does this grow and form a new pattern?  Or does it get slammed back down to the old formation?  Anyone telling you one way or the other is a liar.

imadummyoptionsyay,"CAN CONFIRM. I started fucking with bitcoin in 2010, when it was under $1. I made very good money selling it as it was rising, then buying more on dips, selling and repeating. I would normally sell when up 2-3X.

Then I realized, fuck, this went from $1 to over $100 QUICK. I should just hold these things for awhile. They went up to $1250 and crashed down to less than $100 is 2 days in 2013. I kept holding for two years and finally just sold them all, my last 200, at $400 each as they were staying steady between 2-$400 for the nearly 2 years and I just did not think they would keep rising and I was VERY happy with a 400% return

I tell people how I sold all of them at $400 each and every.fucking.time. ""MAN, HOW COULD YOU BE SO STUPID?! OMG YOU'RE RETARDED. IF I BOUGHT BITCOIN I WOULD HAVE HELD ON UNTIL I WAS A MILLIONAIRE. WHY WOULDN'T YOU HAVE JUST KEPT HALF OF THEM? OMG, YOU'RE SOOO STUPID""

Yeah, I'm stupid. Thats why I made over nearly 200k off bitcoins when all you can take about is what you wish you did with them and never even owned a single one in your life. Fuck, never even HEARD of them until they were worth thousands. But I am stupid for taking 400% profit. Yup",foe0hat,2020-04-24 11:00:32,68

jtoomim,"When I joined Bitcoin in 2013, I saw tremendous potential for Bitcoin as the native currency of the internet. I valued Bitcoin's ability to provide inexpensive, fast, programmatic transactions that did not depend on any bank APIs or KYC or laws or governments, and depended only on math and code. I thought that Bitcoin would replace money within 20 years. Given that Bitcoin transactions had a fee of only $0.01, regardless of the amount sent, I thought they had a clear advantage over credit card and debit card transactions, which typically have a fee of 2-4% in the USA. And they were about 144 times faster than a typical bank wire transfer, while also being cheaper and not susceptible to account freezes or other government or bank shenanigans.

That vision depended on Bitcoin's capacity scaling. In 2013, it seemed obvious that Bitcoin could scale. People had done benchmarks of the ECDSA validation speed -- 5,000 sigops/sec on a typical CPU -- and UTXO lookup processes. We'd calculated bandwidth requirements and disk storage requirements. The hardware requirements started to get hefty for higher transaction throughput rates (&gt; 1k tx/sec), but they seemed reasonable for a high-end enthusiast or hobbyist. SPV wallets were getting widely adopted, so it was clear that most users wouldn't need to worry about that.

But the blocksize limit was never raised. In 2015, the blocksize wars started in earnest. At the time, a majority of Bitcoin users supported an increase in the blocksize limit. But a majority of the developers opposed it, and the owner of /r/bitcoin decided to censor any discussion of a potential hard fork to increase the blocksize limit. This caused a widespread protest against his censorship policy, to which he responded: ""[If 90% of /r/Bitcoin users find these policies to be intolerable, then I want these 90% of /r/Bitcoin users to leave.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/?st=ja45nlq1&amp;sh=ab0c785c) Only about 1/4 did. They left for /r/btc.

The censorship was effective. /r/bitcoin kept the majority of casual users and the inertia of the discussion. Moderators ensured that only one side of the blocksize debate was allowed to be presented. Over the next few years, that resulted in a shift in attitudes in the general public. The majority of support that the big block movement had in 2013-2015 was whittled away, and by 2017 it was a clear minority.

Once it became clear that the SegWit2x compromise would fail, the proponents of increasing Bitcoin's block size switched over to supporting a unilateral minority fork. We believe that Bitcoin was always meant to scale. As Satoshi said, the base technology ""[never really hits a scale ceiling](https://ohmysatoshi.com/timeline)"" Although there are certainly scaling ceilings in the current *implementations*, we want to overcome those limitations. We can't do that as long as progress is impeded by the BTC developers and by politics, so we left.

My opinion is that cryptocurrencies need to scale or they will stagnate and remain irrelevant forever. As long as BTC fails to scale and remains the dominant cryptocurrency, it will suppress the crypto ecosystem as a whole. 

The existing scaling strategies for BTC that I've seen do not look workable. I do not believe Lightning Network has a good enough UX to be viable, and it would also take about 45 years for everyone on Earth to open a BTC LN payment channel with the current 1 MB + SegWit blocksize limit in place -- and that's *without* giving anyone the ability to rebalance their payment channels, which I expect people would need to do once per two weeks.

So at this point, either BTC needs to change its strategy and start to bring in some workable and practical scaling solutions, or we need to shift over to a different cryptocurrency that does scale. ETH could be that currency if ETH 2.0 is ever completed and deployed. Something like Bitcoin Cash could also be that currency. But at this point, I don't think that BTC will be able to do more than limp along.",foedump,2020-04-24 13:10:06,16

Bob-Rossi,"All Grayscale products sell at a premium. GBTC (Bitcoin backed) is the most stable and reasonable fluctuating between *usually* the 10% to 30% range. 

The premium exists for 3 main reasons.

1) Grayscale is pretty much the only player in town. I think other similiar products exist but this is the biggest and longest running. And I think one of the few if only that has a share represtenting a defined amount of the replated crypto. 

2) By being setup as they are, its way easier for non-tech people to get into. No wallets to set up. No navigating and trusting exchanges like Coinbase to onboard your funds. For anyone with a stock account, you can buy it right now instantly, like your would buy Tesla stock

3) That big, beautiful tax haven. Oh, that sexy tax avoidance. The B-E-A-utiful $0 line item on your tax return. You can buy this in an IRA, likely for free now that the big banks are dropping fees to $0. So now I have an asset that mimics the voalitility of BTC that I can both trade for no fee and no capital gains (if you have a roth, or deferred gains if a traditional IRA). Want to try and scalp a 2% swing? Go ahead, you don't have to worry about $17 fees eating into your margins or triggering a ST Capital Gain. Hot. Very hot indeed.

The 3rd point is why I think you may always see a slight premium over a physical BTC. But its actually been in the single digits of late. 

Now, why is ETHE so high? Well, for starters Grayscale's ETHE fund is 1 share for .1 ETH, but they listed the thing at a price that represent a 1 for 1 share backup. Different prices back then, but it would be like listing ETHE for $190 today when it should only be worth $19. So that fucked the market initially and it never recovered. Basically sat at a 2x premium for a long time.

The other big reason is this thing is not very liquid and not much supply. When an ETHE is issued to the primary investory, they can't sell it to us until after 1 year passes. So right now the only ETHE available for sale to us normies is what was issued on April 24th, 2019 OR earlier. So GBTC has a lot of liquidity to absorb high buying pressure and keep the premium normal, but ETHE does not.",fogc7zp,2020-04-25 02:51:53,6

RoughRoadie,"They aren’t the only ones gunning for Ethereum, but it all seems a bit late - doesn’t it?

I’ll admit, I don’t know enough about Cardano. I have been sitting on some Tezos and LINK to supplement the ETH stash though. Those Tezzy boys are in the same boat, looking to compete with and eventually beat out Ethereum. Cool project no doubt, but everyone’s sights being set on Ethereum has me with a couple takeaways.

1) Ethereum has succeeded in becoming a functional and attractive alternative to Bitcoin despite recent economic tension.

2) Those looking to challenge Ethereum are doing their best to maintain a sprint in hopes to catch a competitor already many miles in the lead. They will need a great deal more dev power and innovation to be able to catch up. Without help, one cannot maintain a heavy sprint - be it mentally or physically. Should a project catch up to ETH on a utility scale, then it will still need something to set it apart, something ETH doesn’t currently provide. This is what attracted me to holding some Tezos early on.

The allure of using ETH over BTC is ultimately the versatility of the ecosystem. ETH functions in ways that BTC cannot. If an alt comes along looking to clone all of what Ethereum has to offer, it will still play 2nd fiddle.

Not to say this can’t happen, but a challenger needs to be innovative and not a copy cat.",foh5ypy,2020-04-25 05:41:50,16
benditbackwards,"You are missing the point of the halving.  The halving is a time of celebration for everyone.  You need to read up on the mechanics of Bitcoin.  The mining reward is basically Bitcoin's inflation, when a halving event occurs the inflation of Bitcoin is reduced, since there is now LESS supply of BTC being introduced every 10 min.  So if you have the same demand as before the halving, but now half the supply rate, then the price of Bitcoin should go up!  This means then that the miners will be making more money even though they are making less Bitcoin.  This is the opposite of how a fiat system works, because the govt / fed print money, they 'inflate' ( increase supply ) of dollars, so if there is the same demand, but more supply the value of every dollar is debased ( goes down ) this appears in the marketplace as the price of goods going up.  

In regards to your theory of bitcoin not being as secure, after a halving, that is not so, because the difficulty that is to say the algo of Bitcoin adjusts itself to the available miners every couple blocks or so, I think its about every 10 days.  This means that miners can come and go and there will still be good security on the Bitcoin network,  the remaining miners will basically make more money as the 'weaker' miners quit.

Trust is a relative thing, Bitcoin's method of preserving its value is still far superior to any other kinds of money.  Fiat.. LOL no comparison, most corrupt form of money ever!  Stock market.. LOL give me a break, lots of corruption there too.  The precious metals yea, but there is corruption there as well, there is reports of fake gold bars, you have to trust someone else to verify and store your gold.",foh6373,2020-04-25 05:42:30,6

aminok,"* Lightning Network has barely any adoption. WBTC on Ethereum has more BTC locked in it than the LN: https://defipulse.com/ The security and capital costs of having to keep BTC locked in channels with a network connected LN node holding the private keys to the BTC are too high for most people.

* According to the Lighting Network whitepaper, it needs Bitcoin to have 133 MB blocks for global mass-adoption. Bitcoin post-2017 (post Core takeover) is permanently limited to 1 MB blocks, or 300K txs per day. In other words, it can't handle more than 0.01% of the world's payments. 1% if LN if works perfectly (it doesn't). That means it makes no impact on people's ability to take control over their own wealth.

Could be a descending triangle, could be a bear pennant.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/PX8vGkIs/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/PX8vGkIs/)

I don't often look at volumes in BTC because they're extremely manipulated and the largest trades happen during high volume. Volume is completely faked in this market.

As far as the halvening is concerned, history does tend to repeat I agree- but this is the very first time BTC has had a halvening with futures.

I do think later this year we will see a major run up in BTC- but I also believe that will be the last high Bitcoin sees for many years. Alts will likely follow Bitcoin up and then decouple once the halvening pump fades.

Alts are where the money is at right now, anyone who says otherwise is either clueless or purposely misleading people. It's just a matter of being as patient as maxi's were around 2012 or so.

There are a lot of reasons Bitcoin is bullish af right now, mainly the higher lows on the daily. Problem is we are directly under extremely crucial fibs as well as a MA100/200 cross. I can see $9k at *maximum* happening before a tremendous fall back down to re-test that gigantic cap wick.

The 4h RSI refusing to go below 60 is about the most bullish thing I can see right now. This flag is taking too long and absolutely *screams* bart.

Gas whale see.

First, invest a bit of your time to learn the basics: what Bitcoin actually is, the basics of how it works.

Start here:

The Trust Machine:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKwqNgG-Sv4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKwqNgG-Sv4)

A great **book**: The Bitcoin Standard, by S. Ammous.

Then,  pick a legitimate exchange, create an account, buy a small amount of  Bitcoin (in case you fuck up and lose it all).  Get a good wallet, then  transfer your Bitcoin to your own wallet.

*not your keys, not your Bitcoins*

Do not store your wealth on somebody else's computer system.

After that, maybe buy a pair of wool socks or something with some of your Bitcoin.

When  you know how it works, what it is, how to buy it, how to securely store  it you'll be ready to buy and hold larger amounts, long term.

As  far as trying to time the market?  Don't.  Technical analysis (TA) is  bullshit superstition and you'll likely end up losing a lot of money in a  hurry.  Why be stupid?  Don't be stupid.  Just buy and hold --- for  many years.",forwnp5,2020-04-28 05:36:55,6

For instance, platinum is much more rare than gold, but gold is worth much more than platinum.  Absolute scarcity is not actually the most important factor.  The stock to flow ratio is the ratio of how much exists compared to how much is created each year.

-Teekey-,"&gt; And Riot's also had their share of problems, notably with a bitcoin miner that was installed through the Brazillian League client a while back.

No, that was on the Garena server, which Riot does not control the client for. Every knows and agrees that Garena is trash, and Riot has cutting all ties with them for future titles since League.

&gt;The mass hysteria on reddit when it was discovered that Valorant was a kernel-based AC likely wasn't good PR for them

""Discovered"", because you know...it's not like they didn't [announce it publicly MONTHS ago](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-pl/news/dev/dev-null-anti-cheat-kernel-driver/).

&gt;It's the fact that this directly interfaces with a user-level program that makes a dangerous bridge, while GPU/Device drivers have to interface with Windows before getting any information.

Uh, you really think GPU drivers don't interact with user-level software at all? What?

&gt;And if they're taking steps to secure their software, why can't they take similar steps to settle the minds of the user base they're selling it to? 

Because it's legitimately not an expectation for ANY anti-cheat software and never has been? There's really little reason why it's suddenly an issue other than people not liking Riot, conspiracy theories about Tencent, or people being bored and wanting something to complain about.

&gt;the fact that they're not trying to get that PR back outside of ""Just trust us, bro"" makes it even more sus.

But that's the entire fucking point. If you don't trust them, you simply shouldn't be installing ANY of their software for ANY reason. So why get up in arms over a kernel driver if you suspect they're trying to invade your privacy?",fosjn7c,2020-04-28 09:00:08,5

Instead of thousands of computers verifying your financial transaction, thousands of computers verify the application you run performs the same way on every computer. This model includes everything Bitcoin can do, and a whole lot more.

It's also technically infeasible at this point for the Blockstream fork to catch up. For Bitcoin to retrofit and increase the features in its scripting language many things would need to happen - raising the blocksize is among them. However, Blockstream developers have already called out advanced programming features like the Ethereum programming language 'block pollution'

Most of the Ethereum devs/projects started on top of Bitcoin, lookup Counterparty, Colored Coins/Colu, and MasterCoin. Blockstream chased them out. Now they have to compete against them.

If anything, Bitcoin is broken and Ethereum is kind of our last chance at getting the utility of cryptocurrency to as many people as possible.

Part of the Eth value proposition is that after all the Eth are minted, users have to spend Eth to run the programs on the Ethereum network. This gives the currency a future utility after the network grows.",fosyj32,2020-04-28 11:25:39,9

lucc1111,"Are you trolling? This is r/Steam the biggest digital game selling platform... literally sells computer games through the internet... you can't buy a game without ""putting cash in your computer"".

In case I misunderstood your question I'm gonna lay down the very simple process of money laundry here:

I have 100000 dollars that I made selling drugs and I want to spend them on a nice car. You can't buy an expensive car without saying where you got the money (spoiler: you can't tell the IRS you sold drugs for it)

So what I do is create a shitty game and publish it for a lot of money. Then I buy that game lots of times with my drug money (you can pay people to help you create many steam accounts, borrow people's credit cards, use different credit cards at your name, pay with cash, pay with bitcoin, etc.).

Key point here: Steam nor the IRS will ask you where you got the money for each of those games.

Problem here is considering Steam taking a 30% share of what you made and taxes, you will loose around 40% from this process.

BUT now you have $60000 that you, a **game developer** made **selling one game**, when you go buy that car and the IRS asks you where you got the money you can confidently say you ~~sold drugs~~ sold videogames.",fouyrem,2020-04-29 01:49:49,17

SloppySynapses,"The weekly candle that just closed is the only one that has closed without even a small upwards wick (&lt;1%) this entire month-long rally. The wicks for each candle continue to get smaller, too: 19.2%, 18.8%, 7.0%, 8.1%, 2.5%, and 0.6%.

Is that bullish or bearish?

https://tradingview.com/x/7EbDdDkj/

Copied from my twitter, was curious to hear people's thoughts on it. 

https://twitter.com/CryptoChunky/status/1255209255600300032?s=20

Personally, I think it's potentially bearish, because it means the entire rally has just been gearing up to touch this area eventually, and now that we're here there's no one to take it higher. Note that this area is where the dump began- and it is not unlike bitcoin to fully retrace large momentum dumps just to dump back down again. (see $12k -&gt; $6k -&gt; $12k in feb 2018, $10.9k -&gt; $7.4k -&gt; $10.5k in sep/oct 2019, $10.5k -&gt; $6.4k -&gt; $10.5k in jan/feb 2019)

On the other hand, it's potentially about to break upwards out of this range and soar, especially with the general disbelief that's pretty apparent in the market right now. Every minor pullback, we see negative funding spike, futures discount to 0.5-1%, and people seem to get very sure of a rugpull.

lightfair,"&gt;I have never ever heard of a scammer depositing money directly, can't even find anything online regarding it.

Something similar seems to be quite common for the fake ""sugar daddy"" scams: They offer to pay off the credit card debt. The victim (the sugar baby) attaches the bank account - supplied by the scammer - to her/his credit card. Credit card debt disappears. Scammer asks for some gift cards for gratitude or emergency (or asks to pay off another ""sugar baby""). Original account holder notices fraudulent charge and reverses it. Sugar baby is back to her/his original credit card debt plus the money she sent to the scammer.

There's always one problem with stolen/phished accounts: They cannot be connected and traced back to the scammer. So transferring the money out of them to the target account is not an option because the banks will claw it back (I believe most banks have a mutual understanding about this issue anyway). So what the scammer does is using this money to trick someone else in sending a certain amount in untraceable form (gift cards or - as in your case - Bitcoin).

So it's not money laundering in the usual sense: The scammer is directly ""stealing"" from the second victim. The ""first victim"" (the one whose bank credentials got stolen) is usually not losing any money.",fovp06x,2020-04-29 05:17:24,7

Chilling_Silence,"So a few things come to mind here, however before starting it's worth noting a few things:

1. This knowledge isn't new to those inside the DigiByte community
2. There are no attempts at hiding anything like this
3. I've personally done a number of videos and Medium posts, all of which have been shared on Telegram and by DigiByteCoin twitter account etc specifically looking at this very thing

Now, we also need to address your use of the word ""compromised"" because it's also very misleading, and I think this stems from a misunderstanding around how MultiShield works.

Coming back to this having been discussed before, if somebody has \*all\* of the Bitcoin hashrate in the whole entire world, spread across BTC, BCH, BSV and a bunch of other small-cap coins, and they threw 100% of the worldwide hashrate at DigiByte, they would at most get about 55 blocks when I last did the math. By comparison, they would be able to get 100% of all BTC, BCH and BSV blocks. THAT is compromised.

The reason for this is that if you have one algorithm, let's say you're mining 100% of all SHA256 blocks, the hashrate neded doubles every 5x blocks. Starts off small, 5 blocks, maybe 10 blocks, but then you start getting to a 15-block attempt, and a 20-block attempt. Sure, that's 5 minutes worth by now, but you're already having to use 8x the hashrate than you started with. That's OK, there's still pools that could attempt that... But then you look at 

I'll humor you and presume that all 3 of those top entities are actually one, despite them being unknown, and there being being indications they are not (Which I'll get to later), however in-doing so I'll also show you what compromised really is: Litecoin. The top 3 are all in the same geographic region, the top 3 are all using the same hardware, and we've seen things like Antbleed before so it's not hard to imagine that kind of thing happening again. We have historical evidence of the accuracy of what I'm proposing.

Now, let's say that these 3x individuals colluded on DigiByte, and took their \~32% mining hashrate away: More would flow back in to DigiByte from other places. We know this is true because people mine multiple cryptocurrencies, and we've seen the likes of the Baikal miners switching around between both DigiByte-supported algorithms and others. Their 32% spread across 3x algo's wouldn't be sufficient to pull off any kind of sustained attack.

Sure, they could probably get in a few blocks, we've already seen in a couple of instances where they'll get two blocks in a row (Which we also have seen happen on BTC, so this isn't anything to worry about either), but that doesn't mean they've got enough to go and do some kind of deep reorg.

Again nor do we have any reason to believe they would, we've seen funds going to Bittrex, presumably to sell for the power-cost, but we have no confirmation / indication either way about the trading activities of that individual, and Bittrex wouldn't tell you if you asked them. That said, I've spoken with the Bittrex team, they're certainly not idiots, this isn't their first rodeo, and they're very \*very\* switched on when it comes to looking in to this kind of thing.

But back to 3x entities colluding, they still don't have enough to attack DigiByte because they'd need to both rent enough SHA256, enough Scrypt, and they'd still need to \*hope\* that nobody else came and mined DigiByte during that same time on any form of profit-switching after the difficulty dropped after a few blocks. So it's plausible that 3x entities could collude and could also rent additional hashrate, but it's still not a guarantee that they'd get anywhere.

What baffles me the most though is that we're talking about collusion from 3x different entities like it's a ""done deal"" (""compromised"") when it's really not, it's making a TON of presumptions, and yet at the same time DigiByte is \*still\* more secure than Litecoin? Because if those 3x entities on Litecoin colluded, they have well over 50% and the chain is actually fucked at that point. If we're genuinely looking for \*actual\* problems, let's look at one that's staring everyone in the face, let's address that!

Back to DigiByte though:

Somebody mining 12.5% of all blocks is not ""compromised"". It's to be expected, like I've mentioned in many of my previous videos etc on the topic. Of \*course\* we're going to have some rapid evolution of hardware and FPGA bitstreams for Odocrypt, that was always going to be the case. It's a new algorithm. We aren't sad that Bitcoin is currently pushing hundreds of Exahashes per second, when back in the day you could happily mine on a CPU. Odocrypt on the DE10-Nano was already a thousand odd times faster than a CPU, which was why nobody ever bothered trying to make / optimize a GPU miner for it.

We then see the BlackMiner F1 Mini first of all adding support, which was several times faster than a DE10-Nano, but similar up-front price and power consumption (extrapolated). Then we have the BlackMiner F1, further optimized still, then the next generation of F1-Mini+... But there is still no indicatoin of ""compromised"", both at an individual algorithm or overall level. It does show an interest and a rapid improvement, which was expected, and no doubt somebody is going to be the first to do that. You recall the early ASICs on Bitcoin how they were originally Butterfly Labs, CoinTerra and the likes? They got in early, but where are they today? They're not here because somebody has to be the first, and then people iterate and improve and beat them out of the market.

But your comments of ""It shouldn't be a way for one company to print money, it should be to secure the network"", despite me disagreeing with it, I'll humor you and carry on with that train of thought, looking at how Bitmain dominate most of the market here. What company manufactures most of the hardware for SHA256 and Scrypt? Bitmain! Sure there's a few others like innosilicon coming out with their miners, but you get what I mean, there's always waves of innovation from different companies. Those companies mine with their hardware first, it makes sense if they have a competitive advantage, it's just good business sense to do-so. They then on-sell them usually after the profitability isn't as high, or as they get sufficient stock etc and so we may well also see this play out with the Qubit / Skein hardware.

We simply don't know!

What we do know however is that we have absolutely nothing going on right now that's malicious. We have no indication anything malicious would be attempted. We have no indication that even IF we had the collusion of the top 3x miners that those miners would even be successful at anything more than a few blocks.

Kucoin has only 6 confirmations? Cool, great, that's on their head. If they're confident enough in the network that 6 is all they want, then fucking sweet. Good for Kucoin. They're welcome to set it to whatever they want, low or high. I think Bittrex have theirs set to 40, that seems reasonable enough, and is still only 10 minutes -- Which puts it faster than Bitcoin still if you're waiting for it to be on-chain + 1x additional block.

So yes, let's talk about the weak points here.

Yes, let's address mining centralization, that is happening on FAR far worse on other top 5 market cap coins, but can still be improved upon for DigiByte.

Let's also look at what we're doing replacing SHA256 with ProgPoW and other such things.

Let's not stick our head in the sand though, I've done many videos etc on this before looking at these weak points. I literally made a fucking table on Medium and posted it.

But finally, let's not just use DigiByte as a scape-goat for misinformation when the scenarios you're describing of collusion between entities is FAR easier to pull off on other places.",fovxanc,2020-04-29 06:25:47,6

Tricky_Troll,"The recent price action has had me feeling very bullish and lately we have been slowly becoming less correlated to traditional markets again. However, I’m going to play devils advocate today. I’m a permabull on ETH and you’ll always find me buying at almost any price whenever I am able to. But sometimes it’s worth arguing against your own beliefs to prevent yourself from becoming stuck in a bubble or an echo chamber. So here we go, here is my bearish argument for the short term.

**Stonks:** In my opinion the stock market is one big bear flag right now. Just like in the great depression, the fast drop down was followed by a recovery which lasted a few months before falling for multiple years. However, I believe that in the modern day, we could recover much faster, just as we fell much faster than in 1929.

So what might be the straw which breaks the camels back? I don’t think it will be a single event. Rather it could just be record low earnings reports and defaults from companies which are heavily indebted or run on thin margins having lost economic viability such as airlines and US oil producers.

***Oh shit, what’s that sound?***

Oh yeah, I may be wrong about this. JPow and the gang may save the day with unlimited QE. However, this would of course be at the expense of inflation among other things. But the good news is that this would probably be a great thing for the whole crypto space.

**Technical Analysis:** We have a few factors working against us right now. These are:

Bearish divergence: Notice the rising price and falling volume. Admittedly the volume doesn’t fit the trendline perfectly, but TA is rarely precise.

https://i.imgur.com/yeOfxCt.jpg

Rising Wedge: Rising wedges *usually* break out to the downside and we’re in a pretty clear rising wedge. Also, the recent jump above 200 hasn’t been enough to break out of the wedge (yet!).

https://i.imgur.com/Vq0CmQm.jpg

**Bitcoin Halving**: Historically there has been a dump post-halving before a stratospheric rise in the following months and years. It wouldn’t surprise me if post halving ETH outperforms BTC due to staking hype.

**Conclusion:** I’m expecting a pull-back in the short to mid term (probably after the halving), but after that I’m full bull mode to 10K since we all know about the stunning fundamentals of ETH. 🚀 HODL strong ETHFam.

ahorner,"Some back of the napkin math...

A modern ASIC Bitcoin miner calculating 16 TH/s and consuming 1480W of power running 24/7 will generate on average 0.0035 BTC or **about $31 per month.**

Given this device plugs into your car's 12V outlet (typically a max of 15A) we can extrapolate that it would consume up to 180W of power which, if it was mining bitcoin, would be **just under $4/month if it was running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week** which your car does not.

Now they claim it's not mining Bitcoin but some other crypto but this begs the question: if they have a device that can efficiently generate some crypto, why not build a bunch of them and power the devices themselves?

Seems obvious to me they are mining user data and selling it, likely GPS position, accelerometer acceleration, and who knows what else.",fp09zoo,2020-04-30 09:07:50,18

luwst,"I have a warehouse of 50 computational servers that at any moment, I can instantly activate. They will send so many DDoS attacks to your internet, that you will be unable to use the internet at all. They run on a continuous circuit, and my main use for them is to mine bitcoin. The network effects of my DDos are strong enough that if I leave them running long enough, I can permanently disable someone's internet... If it's a high profile target, like the government or a popular corporation, I can shut it down completely and keep it from working. It would be incredibly easy to sabotage these servers with malware. They run in the background, and can't be stopped. During my 10 year career in electronic warfare, I've shut down over 100 hundred websites, and kept them completely shut down. It's fairly accurate and much more convenient than your average DDoS attacks. I could also issue arbitrary updates to web servers, turn flash players on and off, lock and unlock servers and so on. In addition, my power has granted me the ability to render entire computer networks completely offline. I have sent tens of thousands of DDoS attacks for three weeks using my IRC and Web Chat clients (CrackMyDNS, Argus, ZNC, etc), I've zapped multiple ISPs in two countries, and I was responsible for multiple data leaks.

gotamd,"This is not a bug in the code.  This is a fundamental issue with the design of LN.  Based on [this article](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2020/04/29/), the preferred solution to the problem will clog the main chain even more and therefore hurt the usability and trustlessness of BTC and LN further:

&gt; **Settlement transaction anchor outputs:** Onchain settlement transactions could be redesigned to spend their value to anchor outputs that could be CPFP fee bumped using CPFP carve-out. This would require those transactions to be larger (increasing onchain fees) and presigned (reducing flexibility). This would only directly affect channels which are unilaterally closed while payments are pending, which is already a situation that can significantly increase onchain costs and so is something users try to avoid. However, raising the cost of onchain enforcement also raises the minimum practical value of payments that can be sent trustlessly through LN. Despite these challenges, as of this writing, this appears to be the most preferred solution.

Another workaround to this problem would be to--wait for it--raise the blocksize cap.

rebro1,"I still don't get people being happy when ETH prices in fiat ($) are going up and they don't care about the ratio going down. Yeah, I know people see $ only, especially the newbies who entered the crypto market in the past 2 years. BUT, do you even realize that it's better to HODL Bitcoin in a Bitcoin upwards moments than Ethereum if your goal is to make more fiat ($) money? Percentage wise you get more fiat. So, consider ratio when trading, don't blindly follow fiat ($).

Do you realize that big players, whales, mostly early adopters with shitload of coins are moving markets with ""ratios"" (altcoin/BTC)? And don't start with ""bhut bhut, exchange fiat volume braahh"" - fake and gay. And they move all markets together in sync. There is no real global crypto FOMO. Like the stock market, crypto market is also rigged and manipulated, but more volatile. They can make huge price swings up and down with little or no new money inflow to the market itself, just to fake market activity (wash trading is still a thing in crypto). And huge price swings are often made on purpose to rekt overleveraged newbies (short or long, doesn't matter, it will wick up and down in a matter of a second, *paaaf*, say goodbye to your wife).

**Want to make real money long term?**

- Trade in ratio pairs (ALT/BTC): We are somehow/somewhat at the bottom of this crypto cycle, looking at the previous ATHs and ATLs. There is much more gain potential trading ALT/BTC than ALT/fiat or fiat/BTC, I dare to say 10-100x more.
- If you want to trade in fiat, just buy Bitcoin, don't buy alts
- If you buy, don't panic sell when things go a little bit south, we are near or at the bottom but prices can still go down 2x from now, or even 3x (ratio wise), but that's nothing compared to possible 10-100x future gains on ratio. Just fucking HODL
- DO NOT over leverage, as mentioned above, violent swings aka ""flash crashes"" will rekt you, even stop losses won't always save you because **[insert some crypto exchange bug here]**. I wouldn't recommend going over 2x leverage, but I'm no expert
- Don't trade against the trend and don't daily trade. Shorting ALTs now in this market is a receipe for disaster - not a lot of downward potential, but a lot of upgoing potential, leaving you behind with your open short position, rekting you like a boss.
- Do not listen to ""pro traders and whales"" advices on twitter, youtube and other social media. They are just promoting their market positions, they are not future tellers.
- Book orders (support and resistance, buy/sell walls) are fake as **[insert your favourite dirty word here]** and looking at them, even counting on them is futile. Bots are making instant changes based on the strategy market makers make. Buy and sell walls are there to confuse you. In the old days, especially on low volume coins, they just instantly pulled the support (like 80% of the whole book) and rekted the market for **TeH PhuN aNd tEh GiGgLez**.
- Technical analysis, graph charting and all the magic stuff and buzzwords ""pro traders"" use and draw in crypto is a major bullshit. I can draw you a ""jumping cat"" chart and it will be as credible and real as a text book charts and analysis. Market makers are deceiving you, they ""paint"" the charts for you with their lovely bots. They paint what you want to see, it's not ""organic"". It goes the opposite way of what you think is happening.
- Sell when your grandma or your lost redneck friend suddenly calls you and starts talking about crypto and how he is going to become rich overnight. Sell the FOMO, there will be many more bull/bear cycles to take advantage off. People dragged into FOMO are thinking like modern economists who think Earth resources are unlimited and profit will only go up each year, towards infinity. Don't be a modern economist please, be a ""common sense peasant"" instead.
- Coin price on the ticker is not a real value of the coin, it's just the last trade. So your logic of thinking: ""OMFG brooo, jizz in pants, If I had 10.000 Bitcoins I would have {10.000 x last_ticker_price } moneyzz"" is wrong. Why? You shouldn't be trading if you ask that question, just HODL.
- Your long term trading goal should be making as much ETH or BTC as possible, not fiat.

**TL;DR:**

- Trade in ALT/BTC pair, more gainz ahead
- Don't day trade
- Don't over leverage
- Don't ever go against the trend
- Don't panic sell
- Buy when the whole market is near the bottom and HODL for a year, two, three.
- Sell the FOMO
- **Think RATIO not FIAT**",fp483e3,2020-05-01 09:39:40,14

yojoots,"The article makes the case that the respective dominant narratives for Bitcoin and Ethereum have evolved over time (for BTC, from ""digital cash"" to ""digital gold"" and for ETH, from ""payment for computation"" to ""DeFi backing asset""). This is somewhat misleading, though, in that Bitcoin's core value proposition has always been as a digital gold-like asset; the original whitepaper mentions that Bitcoin mining and issuance was modeled after gold mining, Satoshi [called Bitcoin an implementation of Szabo's Bitgold proposal](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=342.msg4508#msg4508), described Bitcoin as [a digital analogue to gold](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=583.msg11405#msg11405) on multiple occasions, and even in the very earliest days, [pitched Bitcoin as a type of precious metal in digital form](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/p2pfoundation/threads/1/#7). In other words, from the beginning, Bitcoin has been designed (and marketed) as digital gold. Incidentally, for what it's worth, this isn't at odds with it being e-cash; the concept of e-cash is actually surprisingly old and historically speaking it basically means a cryptographically authenticated, practically private bearer instrument. In other words, *most* cryptocurrency qualifies as e-cash on etymological grounds, and Bitcoin is certainly no exception.

The reason I point all of this out is because the idea that ""Bitcoin was originally supposed to be digital cash but then pivoted to be digital gold"" seems to be a misunderstanding of remarkable prevalence, and unfortunately this is often weaponized by Bitcoin's detractors, and spun in the manner of ""Bitcoin lost its way,"" which in light of the above, is very far off-the-mark.

It's more enlightening to **contrast** Ethereum against Bitcoin in this respect, then, because it is certainly true that Ethereum's dominant narrative(s) have radically evolved over time, from computation-payments to fundraising-platform to decentralized-finance-backbone. This makes sense; the Ethereum mantra has been to [""move fast and break things""](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/01what-is.asciidoc#ethereums-development-culture) since inception, and this has always been one of the core differentiators of the project from Bitcoin's much-more-conservative ethos. As [I've said before](https://twitter.com/yojoots/status/1191770542875054081?s=19):

&gt;Ethereum, as a more generalized project, has a community looking for purpose and promise wherever it might be found. Bitcoin is hyper-focused and specialized, and the community fixates instead on protecting that idealized kernel of inviolability at layer-1 as much as possible.

UsernameIWontRegret,"&gt; If PoS would be better, then bitcoins would start with it.

This is flawed reasoning. You're making the assumption that Bitcoin is perfect and that tech doesn't evolve. Let me rephrase it this way. If electric engines would be better for cars then cars would have started with them. That's the same logic you're using. 

&gt;Why would PoS be good? It would lead to more centralization 

It's actually the exact opposite. PoS lowers the barriers to entry, and assures that the people running the network are the actual users of the network. Bitcoin isn't nearly as decentralized as you think. In fact it keeps getting more and more centralized with every halving. With each halving the profitability of miners does down due to less rewards. This means that increasingly only the largest miners will be able to stay in business. So fewer and larger miners end up controlling the network over time.",fpavjtj,2020-05-03 06:56:37,1

I do understand supply and demand. But what happens when miner incentive is taken away (BTC rewards are gone). Fewer miners will stick around just to verify transactions.

Longer verification times means users will be pissed, especially if the only remedy is paying a large expedited processing fee. Users will stop using Bitcoin for purchases aka there won't be demand, and Bitcoin's value plummets.

DamonAndTheSea,"So I [posted this chart a month ago](https://www.tradingview.com/x/LQribfGm/)... this is simple analysis but it's something I'm still siting with.  We've seen a classic V shaped recovery from the lows with price retracing the entire dump and with the largest volume signature in Coinbase history.  This signals to me that the low is in... it's rare we see this kind of signature and generally they're bankable in the long term.

Traditional market weakness and uncertainty about the pandemic still gives me trepidation.  I don't think I'm alone in this feeling despite the recent bounce... it seems like the sane majority sentiment right now is ""Yes price has recovered but we're gonna tank again eventually once equities get a reality check"".  What do you guys think?  How are global circumstances going to affect the crypto markets?

I'm in a 'hodl' position with Bitcoin and have been recently interested in alts given the multi year consolidation phase around the lows (unpopular opinion I think) ... but I really don't know what's going to happen.  The contrarian part of me thinks that this down market in crypto is providing cheap and opportunistic prices when compared against cash and traditional markets which are beginning to look fragile in the current climate.  My practical intuition says crypto is still a bitch to traditional markets and isn't yet mature enough to follow it's own unique price timeline.  

If price manages to push above $10k and hold, my ambivalence will change to bullishness.. until then I'm feeling unclear.

Resistance – BTC had problems in the zone $ 9000 – $ 9150 here is the first test for bulls, the second is waiting for us in the area of $ 9500 and then there will be a magic limit of $ 10000 which has always had strong support for bears.


Trading tips:

Open long in area $ 8400$ – $ 8250$, next round $ 7500,
Open short in area $ 9000$ – $ 9150$, next round $ 9500, $10000,

nullc,"I've been beta testing this the last few weeks. The software is still pretty new but it's great.

One of the exciting new technical features in it is that it has an alternative serialization of Bitcoin transactions which is more bandwidth efficient.  Any bitcoin transaction can be losslessly converted, one transaction at a time, into this alternative serialization and applied across the whole Bitcoin history it reduces transaction sizes by about 25%.

It saves a little more on older blocks, in part because their transactions have a lot more uncompressed pubkeys and compressing pubkeys is one of the things it does to shrink transactions. Newer blocks are more like 20% smaller using this serialization.

Similar, but somewhat less reduction in size can be achieved by using standard compression tools like xz or zstd on groups of blocks.  But because the new serialization in blocksat works a single transaction at a time it's compatible with both transaction relay and fibre's-mempool-powered-reconstruction. (if you do want to work whole-block-at-a-time it can also be combined with traditional compression to get a little more savings).

If a Bitcoin nodes were to use this generally, they could drop their on-disk storage requirement for the full block data by about 25%, they could also negotiate using it with supporting peers and lower their bandwidth used for initial sync and transaction relay. Post erlay, this would give a 15% reduction in the total ongoing bandwidth usage of a node (pre-erlay the bandwidth used by INVs would diminish the gains a lot for anything except history sync).

The cool thing about it is that it's not a consensus change: How you store a block locally, or how two consenting peers share transactions data is no one else's business.  This is why blocksat 2.0 can use the new format without anything changing in the rest of the Bitcoin network.  Right now the blocksat software only uses this new serialization over the satellite-- where space savings is also critical--, but using it on disk or with other peers wouldn't be a huge addition.

The downsides of the new serialization is that it's more computationally expensive to decode than the traditional one, and of course the implementation has a bit of complexity. I've been pushing for this [sort of idea since 2016](https://people.xiph.org/~greg/compacted_txn.txt) (note: the design I described in that link is only morally similar, their bitstream is different-- I'd link to docs on it but I don't think there are any yet), so I'm super excited to see it actually implemented!

The history download is pretty neat: Every block is broken into ~1152 byte packets and redundantly coded with 5% + 60 extra packets.  A rolling window of about ~6500 blocks is transmitted in interleave, resulting in about one packet from each block in the window per minute.  With this setup, which can be adjusted on the sending side,  you can take an hour long outage per day or so plus 5% packet loss and not suffer any additional delays in initial sync. If it does lose sync it saves the blocks it completely received--even if it doesn't have their ancestors yet-- and will continue once the history loops back around again. If you have internet access (potentially expensive or unreliable; or maybe even sneaker net!), you could also connect temporarily and just get the chunk of blocks you missed instead of waiting for it to loop around again.

The software was also rebased on 0.19-- their prior stuff had been falling behind a bit.

The satellite signal is doing some neat stuff:  They time division multiple two different bitrate streams  (one about 100kbit/sec like the original blocksat stream, and one about 1mbit/sec) on the same frequency.  The low rate stream can be reliably received with a smaller dish and under worse weather, and only carries new blocks, and transactions.  The high rate stream also carries new blocks and transactions (when they show up), but in addition carries the block history. When new blocks come in the data from both streams contribute to how fast you receive the block.

I believe they're recommending an 80cm dish now, mine are 76cm and the signal on both streams is very strong and robust against poor weather. YMMV based on location and weather conditions. The low rate stream should be reliable on pretty small dishes.

This new high rate stream also significantly reduces the latency for transmitting blocks, making it more realistic to mine using blocksat as your primary block feed (and then using $$$ two-way sat to upload blocks when you find one).  Right now 4 second latencies are typical though there is some opportunity for software running that should get it consistently closer to 1 second.  The updated stream also handles multiple sat feeds more seamlessly-- in some regions you can see two different blocksat feeds, such as in California where I live, and if you have two receivers it'll half the latency to receive blocks (and obviously increase the robustness).

The new setup makes it easier to separate the modem from the bitcoin node.  You can have a modem left closer to the dish(es) connected to ethernet (directly w/ their ethernet attached modems, or w/ a usb modem and a rpi) have it send udp multicast across a network to feed one more receiving bitcoin nodes.  This can help eliminate long annoying coax runs.

Finally, they also preserved the ability to get the stream with a pure SDR receiver *and* added the ability to use an off the shelf USB DVB-S2 modem, and the DVB modems are more flexible in what LNBs you use... so if you're in a location where getting more blocksat specific hardware is inconvenient or might erode your privacy-- they've got you covered.

All in all, I think this is pretty exciting.",fpif0ni,2020-05-05 09:46:00,12

Terrible place to start a new margin position (keep accumulating instead).  Bitcoin needs to hold the 1hr 100MA.


That having been said, after that pivotal scam/cool off move now we can go higher.  This would happen very soon with the halving one week from right now.  Any drops will be much weaker until then.


Eth however has clearly lost its independent momentum and it's all about grandpa Bitcoin right now.  After the post halving drop (if any), all eyes will be on Eth.

- A realtime control program running in a variant of linux known as ""RTLinux"".  It drove sensors and digital lines and it had to do it basically with interrupts off to provide hard realtime timing guarantees.. IN KERNEL SPACE.  It was pain.  Couldn't even use kmalloc(). Had to be C because no C++ in the kernel.

- Various drivers I also had to write for Linux for esoteric hardware that nobody supported at the time (this was in the early-to-mid 2000's)

- Matlab native code.  I used C because the people that hired me to do it didn't really know C++.. so I figured I'd leave them with some code they could at least maintain and change going forward.

- Python-&gt;C native code to optimize a few things that were slow.  I could have used C++ for this but -- the Python interop to C is more straightforward and I figured the code itself was easier to undertand by even noobies if C. (Again, it had to remain maintainable by people that weren't necessarily C++ people -- C is more readable in general for people coming from other languages owing to it being a simpler language).

- I got commissioned to take this Bitcoin mining pool software called ""ckpool"" and modernize it and adapt it to Bitcoin Cash.  It's written in C.. so. Yeah.

- I had to write some sound drivers for MacOS a few years ago and the sound API on Mac is C (or was back then).  Not even objective C.  It had to interop with existing code that was all C.  So I just did it in C...

So someone that daytrades or invests in altcoins may be forced to use specialized software or hire an accountant for thousands of dollars and someone that just makes an occasional purchase of Bitcoin and withdraws it has a much easier task of calculated any taxes especially if they don't make large purchases giving them an excuse to simply not report. Not the same if you are daytrading on exchanges , especially if you have made over 200 trades in a year.

Also there is a distinction between short term and long term capital gains taxes so its much wiser to not sell your BTC for at least 1 year so at worst you have to pay the much lower long term capital gains -

Look at this chart -

https://www.fool.com/taxes/2020/01/02/capital-gains-tax-rates-in-2020-a-comprehensive-gu.aspx

TL;DR - most people will need to pay 15% in the USA for selling BTC after a year.

**Buy Bitcoin , record the price you bought it for and the date in a spreadsheet and wait at least 1 year before selling it or taking profits so if you do decide to pay taxes on profits you are at least in the lower tax category of long term capital gains.**

Many people do not pay taxes when they spend BTC or sell it in person for cash but if you sell on any exchange like coinbase in the future , buy a car, boat, atv, house , land with Bitcoin , you better pay your taxes

Examples - 

**Example 1 legal**: Say you bought 10 BTC for 1k USD each and want to sell them over a year later. Those BTC are now worth 10k each so you have a realized profit of 90k USD, thus your taxable income is now 90k if you have no other income. This would means you are in the 15% tax bracket thus are subject to 13,500 USD in taxes on the profit - deductions and writeoffs. So lets say with your writeoffs and deductions you now have to pay 6.5k in taxes , leaving you with 83,500 USD to put a down payment on a home.

**Example 2 legal** - You have 10 BTC purchased or mined at 1k each when you received them. This is now worth 100k USD. You wait a year to sell them and never sell more than the amount where your total income exceeds 39,375 usd per year and than file your taxes where you pay none due to being in the first capital gains bracket **if you have no other sources of income as you state** . This will take several years or much longer(as btc continues to appreciate) to slowly sell off your bitcoin


**Example 3 technically illegal**  - You have 10 BTC purchased or mined at 1k each when you received them. This is now worth 100k USD. You decide to use your reported income from your occupation to buy a home and keep the BTC spending separate on other items. You slowly spend your BTC on amazon, plane trips, hotels, selling small amounts in person or in atms without ID , restaurants in a private manner(personal wallet that you control private keys and you have done the minimum to wash the BTC). Technically you need to report taxes on every tx , but since you are not day trading the exchange you bought the BTC from does not report you and it is unenforceable for the IRS to even know you are spending those BTC. Since you are not buying large items registered to your identity you are also not targeted as well.",fplr2bl,2020-05-06 07:30:44,6

Zectro,"&gt;I doubt the unis will make an annoucement of this

They won't because of GDPR.

CSU though might make an announcement. This has to be really embarassing for them. The guy relabelled a graph on ornithology and presented it as information security research. That alone (without even taking into account all the other plagiarism) is a punch line. The school is ""for the birds"" until they publicly make that right.

&gt;only question is: how would anyone know if those uni kicked him out of the programs or revoke his doctorate? 

Not sure. Part of me kind of hopes that this will come up in court in some capacity, and Craig will have to risk perjuring himself (again) or admit he's no longer a student at these institutions. Maybe u/mccormack555 could bring up Craig's history of academic fraud and get him to make a statement under oath one way or the other about whether he's been expelled? 

It could come up in the Kleiman case too, because one avenue of attack Craig has been using against Dave is claiming Dave didn't have the credentials to create Bitcoin whereas Craig does. The plaintiffs finding that Craig had been expelled from at least 2 institutions for academic fraud and/or had his PhD rescinded would totally undercut that argument.

Not sure how likely this is, or whether Craig will even balk at the idea of perjuring himself once again, especially when it will let him save face before his followers.",fpm4ikl,2020-05-06 09:36:37,5
puff_paff,"they are quanto futures (just like the quanto swaps); this means #eth long/short varies whenever bitcoin value changes; this implies additional risk for market makers. One cannot just go ""100 eth spot long + 100 quanto short"" and earn funding because if bitcoin increases 20% your position has become ""100 eth spot long + 120 quanto short."" The size of your position changing might not seem a big deal for retail speculators, but it probably is pretty important for market makers taking on very large position (and need to keep their books in check/neutral)

see also: 

https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/understanding-quanto-risk-and-opportunity/

In the past I tried to run various arbitrage strategies on the quanto swap; it seems the funding on the quanto swap is actually fairly priced at an average of 3.5% per month (or 0.1% per day), this was my average cost of dynamically adjusting my positions, in the end I was running breakeven and I could not outperform the ""easy money funding"" on the ethusd swaps; probably somebody smarter has running some algorithm to price this stuff accurately. 



the ethusd quanto future should have an average premium of 10% per quarter, which seems insane, but is the ""fair price."" My estimate of 10% is because ""long quanto swap at 0.1% average for 90 days"" should equal ""short 10% quanto future premium."" 

If your portfolio does not need to stay neutral and one thinks ethusd is going to zero, then the quanto future offers a nice 10% bonus.",fpm6b47,2020-05-06 09:54:06,8

yeahdave4,"Everyone is expecting this all to breakdown and fall apart.  Every other comment is ""see you at 150"" or ""I am going to sell now and buy back in later"".

Y'all are in my way.  

That is not what I am seeing.  [My outlook](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/gd67fs/daily_general_discussion_may_4_2020/fpin38u/) is different pre-halving.  

I am no magician or some fortuneteller.  I'm not cool enough to use [magical triangles](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/gdsczp/daily_general_discussion_may_5_2020/fpmhqie/).  But I am going to put my thoughts out there as a contrary view.  

The tug of war is indeed grinding the ratio down.  It is Bitcoin's time right now.  200 is now irrelevant and paper thin.  Eth was 216 at this level on the way up.  Now it is slithering around 204.  Any dip in Bitcoin is going to send Eth below 200 due to the ratio.  All this means is that stops should be planned accordingly.  190 is the new 200.  Margin positions that would liquidate at 192 or above are very high risk.

I can't predict what will happen on the day of/day after the halving.  I am not going to try.  There is so little data, it would be silly to try to be firm on anything.  I will just be ready for whatever happens.

As for me, I will be patient.  If I am wrong, so be it.  But this is [why I take profits and wait](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/gc1lnx/daily_general_discussion_may_2_2020/fpals77/) for the right entry.  People were looking back at my [$153 and below longs](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/g0dbc4/daily_general_discussion_april_13_2020/fnbec1v/) and were saying how ""lucky"" I was.  It was really choppy then too.  It is choppy now.  [Just as before at 170](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/g59vps/daily_general_discussion_april_21_2020/fo42dxl/), I'd be sweating bullets shorting here at 204.  

In anycase, my money is where my mouth is and I will pay the price for being wrong. [Still long at 202 and nauseatingly long at 194 on that last breakdown attempt](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/gclrom/daily_general_discussion_may_3_2020/fpew9ar/).  Either way I'll just get to buy cheaper Eth and accumulate longer.

[This post](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/gdsczp/daily_general_discussion_may_5_2020/fpmhvb4/) was made with Bitcoin/Eth at 8975/204.  Got a lot of love (sarcasm) for the post.  The lovely PMs were great thanks (again sarcasm).  People apparently added to their shorts in spite.  Well within 2 hours the current move up started and now we are back at the top of the original run with bitcoin hitting 9400 again.  Yes Eth is $20 short but that was expected.  Yes this is not going to be a clean freight train up.

This is probably going to be my last post on the market for a while.  I am not interested in petty triangle squabbles.  I don't really care what one indicator is saying.

In any case, I don't think I am proved right yet, but I caution against the heavy negative and dour bias.  You are shorting a coiled spring.  This market has been beaten to death for several years.  The black swan global pandemic drop to the 3000's/90's was a pivot point.

I brought this up [last week](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/ga43kl/daily_general_discussion_april_29_2020/foz8pns/), but I want to restate a few things again simply as a counter to the heavy negative bias.  My position/perspective is built on several factors and I am not going to go through them all, but I see some assumptions being made that I think are incorrect so I will focus on those.

With the insane monetary policy around the world, eyes are on gold and crypto.  This is real. 

GBTC and ETHE are making massive purchases of Bitcoin/Eth and are now even going in the opposite direction of the price of Bitcoin/Eth.

Economies are starting to open up. 

ETH hash rate is up

ETH transactions are up

ETH exchanging hands is up

ETH accumulation is up

ETH number of addresses is up

Exchange activity/accounts are up

Miners are hoarding

BTC halving is coming

EIP 1559 is coming

ETH2 is nearly here

Yes we could wake up to 150 again. Yes FOMO (using money you shouldn't or leverage that is reckless) is bad. But last time we were here, we suddenly showed up at $1400 in ~4 months. That is an increase in $300 a month. An increase of more than the current value

every

month.

It is far too slow, too resource-heavy, too insecure, and too volatile to be useful as a form of exchange for every day commerce.

It was designed to be highly deflationary, which makes it a terrible currency. 

It has no intrinsic value, which makes it useless as a commodity.

It does not contribute to the production of any product or service. There is no form of value creation anywhere in the entire Bitcoin ecosystem, which makes it a worthless investment vehicle.

In or around June 2016, the Conspirators used the Malaysian server to host the dcleaks.com website. On or about July 6, 2016, the Conspirators used the VPN to log into the @Guccifer_2 Twitter account. The Conspirators opened that VPN account from the same server that was also used to register malicious domains for the hacking of the DCCC and DNC networks. b. On or about June 27, 2016, the Conspirators, posing as Guccifer 2.0, contacted a U.S. reporter with an offer to provide stolen emails from “Hillary Clinton’s staff.” The Conspirators then sent the reporter the password to access a nonpublic, password-protected portion of dcleaks.com containing emails stolen from Victim 1 by LUKASHEV, YERMAKOV, and their co-conspirators in or around March 2016.""

fan_of_hakiksexydays,"You have do understand the fundamentals of the halving. This is not something that happens overnight. And it's also not based solely on some wall street speculation and buying the news type of deal.

A lot of people don't understand that the halving is a built in inherent deflationary function of Bitcoin. That's the part that increases the value of Bitcoin. The effects take months and years. After the halving the value of Bitcoin starts to slowly increase with each new Bitcoin mined, while slowly increasing the rate of rarity of Bitcoin.

The historical data typically shows the start of a bull market in the months after the halving day. Which would be typical for an instrument that deflates.

If the halving fomo price was already priced in, we would be at least above 20K by now. There's never been a cycle where the ATH is lower than the previous cycle's.

But if you take a second to look at the history of each halving cycles, you will see that we're not even at that phase yet, the fomo period typically happens around a year later when the market starts to realize the effect of the deflation, and the big masses jump in when things start to look ripe and the headlines are filled with crazy price jumps.

I've worked for the gentleman before so its a welcome job.  Doing odd jobs, lifting/cleaning, building out stuff he need, light carpentry work etc.  I'll never not do manual labor.

Also making a porch swing for my wife from plans I made up in my head.  It's a fat mans cradle. The ""seat"" on it is actually the size of a baby crib mattress and the back cushion will be a body pillow.  The whole thing is suspended with 600lb rope and stained/poly.

It doesn't make any sense to actually try and use it as an actual currency when you can just use a credit card and get points for doing it.

As far as an investment the price of bitcoin is extremely manipulated and the average investor can easily lose almost all of their investment.

lightfair,"The problem for scammers is always to turn money from compromised bank accounts into something that can't be traced back to them (for obvious reasons). For equally obvious reasons the typical ""money laundering"" doesn't work here as well: Once the first victim (the one with the compromised account) notices that something is wrong he'll have the transfer reversed (this will become important in a sec).

Enter the sugar baby. The scammer uses the compromised account to pay off the CC debt, usually by attaching the account to the CC. This seems to work great, and now for a variety of reasons (personal emergency, gift for a different sugar baby, show of gratitude...) the scammer needs the sugar baby to send him gift card codes (or buy Bitcoin). The sugar baby does so and hence supplies the scammer with a non-traceable quasi-currency. Next thing is of course that the first victim notices something is wrong with his account and consequently reverses the transfer. Sugar baby has the old CC debt back plus the money she sent to the scammer (and possibly an investigation into the whole situation).

TheGreatMuffin,"For the newcomers: 

A node is a software that verifies your bitcoin transactions for you (implicitly it also verifies the overall supply of bitcoin, protects you from fraud from third parties, from ""fake"" bitcoin etc) and gives you a higher level of privacy (you don't leak sensitive information to your wallet's nodes, f.ex).  

Here's a great explainer by P. Wuille (it doesn't include the privacy part though, which I deem as important as the rest of that explanation):  

&gt; One of Bitcoin's strengths - the most important in my opinion even - is the low degree of trust you need in others.   
&gt;  
&gt;    
&gt; If you use a full node for your incoming transactions, you know that there was no cheating anytime in the history of your coins:  
&gt;  
&gt; * Nobody ever created money out of nothing (except for mimers, and only according to a well-defined schedule).  
&gt; 
&gt; * Nobody ever spent coins without holder their private key.  
&gt; 
&gt; * Nobody spent the same coins twice (but see further).  
&gt; 
&gt; * Nobody violated any of the other tricky rules that are needed to keep the system in check (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, ...).  
&gt; 
&gt; ... with one exception: because there is a need to pick a winner in presence of multiple competing valid versions of the ledger, (a majority of) miners have the authority to pick the version of the block chain that wins. This means their power is limited to choosing the order in which otherwise valid transactions occur, up to and including the right to delay them indefinitely. But they cannot make invalid transaction look valid to a full node.  
&gt;  
&gt; If you are not running a full node, the amount of trust you're placing in others increases.  
&gt; 
&gt; SPV nodes (such as some mobile clients, and Multibit) place a blind trust in the majority of miners, without checking validity of the blockchain they produce. It still requires a majority of miners to mislead an SPV node, but they can make it believe anything (including ""You received 10000000 BTC!""). The reason why this does not happen is because full nodes would not accept such blocks, and assuming a large portion of the ecosystem does rely on full nodes, miners who do this would not see their blocks accepted by the larger economy, resulting in them wasting money.  
&gt;  
&gt; Centralized services (most webwallets) make the user trust whatever the site says. They can claim anything.
&gt;  
&gt; So I hope you now see the importance of full nodes in this model. If you run a full node somewhere on the network, and nobody looks at the transactions it validates, it is indeed contributing to the network, but it is not helping with the reduction of trust.  
&gt;  
&gt; Look at it another way: if only a few large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem were running full nodes, it only requires a malicious intent, or an attack/threat against them, to change the system's rules, as nobody else is validating.  
&gt;  
&gt; Doing transactions in the Bitcoin ecosystem helps the Bitcoin currency. Running a full node helps the network. Using a full node helps you and the ecosystem reduce the need for trust.

It’s like rolling dice. If you roll a die once per minute, how long on average is it till you roll a 6? 

Turns out to be 6 minutes. But you could roll successfully on the first try, or it could take 60 tries.

Bitcoin will adjust its “rolling difficulty” to have the average roll time be 10 minutes. Say if you start being able to roll faster, you will get more 6s per minute so the game changes to require you to roll 2 dice and have both get 6s. Bitcoin has a similar process.",fq89sok,2020-05-11 10:43:38,5

Nice to see my favorite sub on reddit again and I hope everyone is  enjoying the wild ride of 2020. Volatility is your friend, especially on a scarce asset at the early stages of price discovery.  Don't let anyone convince you volatility is a problem, there are no crazy gains without it.

My outlook on bitcoin hasn't chanced, still a long-term bull, still holding my coins and steadily collecting. I fully expect another bubble by 2023, would even say that price discovery can't happen without these bubbles. 

The Paul Tudor Jones story is also pretty damn bullish, not that I needed any more reasons. People in denial are like ""*he's just trading cash settled FUTURES bro*""...man shut the fuck up. He wants exposure to bitcoin because he's fucking bullish on the price, his letter and interview basically validating many of the reasons bitcoiners have been bullish for years. The entire macro backdrop of the world also validates many reasons people have been bullish for years. When the big swinging dick of hedge fund gets in, others will follow or else when they under perform, because they still think bitcoin is a ponzi, they're gonna look like idiots. Bitcoin has been here for 11 years, it's not cute anymore to compare it with tulips, you're a fucking idiot.

yeahdave4,"There's a fair bit of back channel discussion and nervousness going on in the BTC mining industry that many might not be aware of.

With the block rewards taking a 50% cut, more and more mining operations are going to be depending on transaction fees unless the price of BTC goes up.  Bitcoin is however relatively unused in terms of true transaction volume and so transaction income is expected to be insufficient after the next difficult adjustment.  Also now with batched transactions/Segwit there's even less net transaction fees to earn.

The hope then becomes that if the price of 1 BTC goes up but your fixed electricity costs don't change, then less efficient (non-Chinese) miners might survive.  However the difference between this halving and prior ones is that mining is now much more centralised in China and China has built significant mining infrastructure that give it a huge advantage.  There is concern that the Chinese miners that have been hoarding BTC recently will open shorts and use their large BTC pools to nuke the BTC price to put non-Chinese miners out of business (kind of like what happened with oil).  It will be interesting to see how things play out.

The scenario: Bitcoin after the halving has cut it's reward per block in half, a lot of miners are now mining at a loss and are forced to sell bitcoin as soon as they get it and then some. Their reserves slowly dwindling hoping for better prices in the future.

Large OTC desks who get their supply of bitcoin from miners essentially get their supply cut in half and need to sustain their business with more liquidity. Where do you think they'll get that from? Eventually all roads point to a increase in spot buying.

Unfortunately, a US court stopped TON from happening. How? Imagine that several people put their money together to build a gold mine – and to later split the gold that comes out of it. Then a judge comes and tells the mine builders: ""Many people invested in the gold mine because they were looking for profits. And they didn't want that gold for themselves, they wanted to sell it to other people. Because of this, you are not allowed to give them the gold.""

If this doesn't make sense to you, you are not alone – but this is exactly what happened with TON (the mine), its investors, and Grams (the gold). A judge used this reasoning to rule that people should not be allowed to buy or sell Grams like they can buy or sell Bitcoins. 

Perhaps even more paradoxically, the US court declared that Grams couldn't be distributed not only in the United States, but globally. Why? Because, it said, a US citizen might find some way of accessing the TON platform after it launched. So, to prevent this, Grams shouldn’t be allowed to be distributed anywhere in the world – even if every other country on the planet seemed to be perfectly fine with TON.

This court decision implies that other countries don’t have the sovereignty to decide what is good and what is bad for their own citizens. If the US suddenly decided to ban coffee and demanded coffee shops in Italy be closed because some American might come there – we doubt anyone would agree.
And yet, despite that, we have made the difficult decision not to proceed with TON.

Sadly, the US judge is right about one thing: we, the people outside the US, can vote for our presidents and elect our parliaments, but we are still dependent on the United States when it comes to finance and technology (luckily not coffee). The US can use its control over the dollar and the global financial system to shut down any bank or bank account in the world. It can use its control over Apple and Google to remove apps from the App Store and Google Play. So yes, it is true that other countries do not have full sovereignty over what to allow on their territory. Unfortunately, we – the 96% of the world’s population living elsewhere – are dependent on decision makers elected by the 4% living in the US.

This may change in the future. But today, we are in a vicious circle: you can’t bring more balance to an overly centralized world exactly because it’s so centralized. We did try though. We're leaving it to the the next generations of entrepreneurs and developers to pick up the banner and learn from our mistakes.

I am writing this post to officially announce that Telegram’s active involvement with TON is over. You may see – or may have already seen – sites using my name or the Telegram brand or the ""TON"" abbreviation to promote their projects. Don’t trust them with your money or data. No present or past member of our team is involved with any of these projects. While networks based on the technology we built for TON may appear, we won’t have any affiliation with them and are unlikely to ever support them in any way. So be careful, and don’t let anyone mislead you.

I want to conclude this post by wishing luck to all those striving for decentralization, balance and equality in the world. You are fighting the right battle. This battle may well be the most important battle of our generation. We hope that you succeed where we have failed.",fqef7a7,2020-05-13 03:02:29,8

throwmeabone86,"Totally fair to fixate on the 500k I’m the first to admit that it is absolutely dumb luck. Like “life is like a box of chocolates” level silly. Prepare yourself for a story of luck and undeserved compensation. 

Started 2010/11, sophomore year of high school, I was the new turbo nerd AP Comp Sci TA and I’d been hearing about this worthless ($0.50/BTC) fake internet money called bitcoin. As a hopelessly over aspirational TA/total brown nosing teachers’ pet I decided that as a demo for the class I should reappropriate 6 used off lease dell optiplex into a cluster to mine, and kind of explain the mechanism as best I understood at the time. 

Mining the then nearly worthless ($0.50/BTC) bitcoin on a cluster of very not optimal off lease dell business machines 3yo at the time from like 2009 (remember that plastic cover on the optiplexes with the swooping curve that snapped shut over the one USB port on the whole thing? Yeah me too.) Mining was obviously not profitable at the time, but it was a beautiful demo of trustless transactions so it didn’t really matter. BTC was basically worthless so at the end of the semester the students obviously didn’t want the hassle of even one more task than was mandated by the state, so they didn’t take it.  I asked my boss, the classes real teacher, what to do with the coin we’d mined. She let me buy it at cost, cash. She said the money would go to the school’s party fund. I’ve always hoped and assumed it really went to her personal party fund, lol. So, $10 cash poorer and 20BTC richer, I proceeded to do nothing more for like 7 years.

In Fall 2017, I started to hear news about bitcoin being worth tons. “Gee whiz!” Thought I, at the time living my best life out of my fraternity house basement while slowly getting myself pushed out of school due to generally being a degenerate and not applying myself to graded work like I really should have been. “I wonder how many 30 racks of Hamms I can get for 20 BTC?” 

As it turns out, 20BTC (worth ~$100k oct 2017) affords you a lot of beer. So, like a month-ish later and after returning from Vegas with my roommate, I took went to the older and more responsible brothers of the chapter with 18 BTC and asked them what to do. 

“Pay of your dues!” One said.
“Hire an actual professional to look at the mold/broken wall/whatever” they had recently broken.

“Have you been following Tesla?” The vet science grad student chimed in from the back. “Bitcoin is too volatile. Sure it’s worth a lot now, but it’s not real. You have enough that you need in something tangible”

My whole contribution in effort or finance to this massive profit being $10 7 years ago, I opted to agree that I should act now and get into TSLA as soon as possible. So I made haste, and a few weeks later and not just a few more cases of beer I took just under 18 BTC and (through proper and legal channels, don’t worry) spent what had started as a $10 bill in the science lab on like ~200k of ~$350/share TSLA.
If I hadn’t been as drunk as I was at the time, I would have been sane and just taken the win and the huge pile of cash.

So now: that $200k at $350/share sat and it grew for a couple years. Recently, considering myself to be a more sober and sane person than in the past, I opted for the win. I took the cash, and got out. Which brings me to where I am today, asking for your advice!",fqev997,2020-05-13 05:09:24,12

Shinigamisama0,"Impulse:  Great menu, it's my favorite out of the ones i own.  It has great protections and great trolling features, but its recoveries are detected right now. Unlike most mod menus, it has controller support so i dont need to switch between controller and keyboard to use it. Impulse has a built in ScriptHookV Loader, meaning it can inject script mods such as Menyoo and Angry Planes into your game, and you can even use them online.  Impulse is the most feature packed of the menus.  Imp has a fleshed out player and vehicle blacklist system called Overseer, which is very useful for keeping track of certain players and making sure they are never in your session, or if you want to really mess with someone in particular and want to know whenever he's online so you can quickly join his session.  Imp does not have an official discord server, but there is a fan run server at impcord.xyz.  Impulse.one is their mainwebsite, but to buy it you need either bitcoin or cryptovoucher.  Many resellers also sell it, the reseller i bought my key from is resellerss.weebly.com

Phantom X:  Another fantastic menu.  It currently does not have controller support, but that is confirmed by the devs to be coming.  Phantom X's recoveries are also detected right now.  Phantom X is the best menu to get for coloading, as you can coload it with any other menu available, meaning you can use it at the same time as another menu.  I always coload it with Impulse.  Phantom X has great trolling features, and there is no menu that can defend against Pain In The Ass.  Phantom X also has two unique features that no other menu that i know of has:  A fully functional The Flash mod and Ghost Rider mod.  The Flash mod is the exact same one you can download from JulioNIB's Patreon, and while many other menus have a Ghost Rider mod, Phantom X is the only one where it ignites your vehicle as well as yourself, and it's the only one where you can actually burn someone from standing on them or punching them.  All the other menu's flash mods are just particle fx.  PX recently recieved a huge update adding a lot of protections.  PX has a great launcher that lets you see the menu's status as well as rockstar server's status, and it lets you view all of the available custom cars and outfits and download them straight from the launcher.  PX does not have a website, but they do have a vk page at vk.com/phantomcommunity.  PX also has a discord server.  I bought my PX account from recoverygods.com

Disturbed:  Disturbed is also good.  It is my least favorite out of the three menus that i own.  It lacks controller support and its menu design is ugly.  Its recoveries are currently detected, but they are the best method of recovery available.  Disturbed is the easiest and fastest menu to inject.  Its protections don't always work though.  Disturbed's black hole is very fun to use.  Disturbed doesn't really have unique features.  Disturbed's website is w1tch.pro.  you can find disturbed's discord server at their website, and you can also buy disturbed directly from their website.  If you need a reseller, i bought my disturbed from Voidshaman.com.  

Paragon is also hailed as a great menu, and while i can vouch for its rock solid protections, i cant vouch for anything else because i do not own Paragon.  Paragon's website is paragoncheats.com",fqfde0g,2020-05-13 07:35:09,14

Quite the opposite. Tail emission is one of the most important features of Monero, and would definitely help Bitcoin too. Relying entirely on tx fees is a very risky plan to say the least. 

Tail emission is so small, it won't even cover lost coins. On the other hand it gives a significant boost to stability / security / miner incentive.

Gets further manipulated into having to choose between quitting the black that he thought was grey and continuing the black that he’d yet to be paid for. Eventually gives out personal info to a friend and later admits to friend that he does black hat work.

Quits black hat work and gets relatively clean. Starts a ~~grey Jedi~~ morally neutral hacker blog and gradually begins working full time in CyberSec unraveling and tracking digital locust plagues.

One day, a hospital worker can’t log into email and eventually all his appointments are cancelled. Later he realizes that this isn’t just his computer, or hospital, or hospital network. One locust plague took down all the computers and is charging lots of bitcoin to get them back.

Savant hacker dissects the code of a locust and finds a question that must never be answered or the locust dies. He answers the question and gets help from all of his hacker coworkers and friends to continue answering the question. This is a sinkhole. After a week of answering questions and warding off those who want him to stop answering questions, he is paid thousands of dollars to sleep.

Three months later, he parties during a hacker convention then gets arrested by the FBI for thhat black hat stuff he did a while back. What sorts of awful things does the Nevada prison system do to their inmates? Well, they did some of that to him.

Other hackers begin to help him and pay for insane legal fees. The community rallies and some people think he’s guilty, some people think he’s not, some people think he knew how to stop the really bad locust plague from earlier because it was secretly *him* all along. It wasn’t. It was North Korea. More than a year later, an old judge uses his experience to see that he’d be chaining down a super hero if he was “fair” with his sentencing.

Savant hacker doesn’t see himself as a super hero and is really eaten up (not by a locust plague) that lots of people helped him even though he knew he was guilty. Now he surfs and tracks locust for a living. And he wants to move back to California.

Pilebsa,"I'm a software engineer.  As well as a DBA.

Blockchain as a concept is just that: a concept.   It's an idea that revolves around taking information and distributing it among a random group of systems/servers.

The other half of the concept is the idea of how to motivate people to run servers to maintain/store the blockchain, using some kind of reward system like mining tokens or transaction fees.

In theory, it's an interesting, creative idea.

Whether it makes sense comes down to one simple question:  Is it an improvement?    Does it do something explicitly better than existing methods and resources in place?

This is the question crypto enthusiasts avoid honestly answering, or else they delude themselves into thinking it does do something better/faster/easier/more securely, etc.   In practice it doesn't, and if this isn't obvious to you that it does, you know why: It doesn't.

When you question adherents about the value of blockchain, one of the most common answers is not an answer, but a rhetorical question like, ""Do you know how many people thought the early Internet was useless?""   Or ""When fax machines came out, nobody thought they'd have much use.""    All these types of examples don't work.  E-mail and Internet services were instantly obvious as being an improvement over traditional mail.   The Fax machine was also an obvious improvement.  You didn't need to sit down and watch a 45 minute lecture in order to see this new technology did something better/faster.   

The fact that you are asking this question: ""Why is blockchain flawed?"" is another distraction. 

It's not that blockchain is ""flawed.""   It's just not really any ""solution.""  

Ask anybody to explain what blockchain does better than any other existing system?  You can't get a simple answer, because there is nothing.  It's an interesting technology that has not found a practical use.

I could go into the technical details of why blockchain is less efficient than traditional monetary management systems, but we don't really need to.   I can use a credit card and execute a transaction in one second.  To do the same using Bitcoin could take anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour or more.  And that's because of the design of the technology.

So why is blockchain popular?

It's not really popular in any significant sense.  It became a bit of a novelty and gained enough ground to have a certain critical mass of people adopt its use, and then became a platform primarily fueled by criminal activity and money laundering.  So there's a lot of dirty money in the industry, and where there's money, there's going to be hype and opportunists looking to exploit that market.   People involved in this industry have not invented a better mousetrap.  They just see a lot of money floating around in what is basically a Ponzi scheme, and they hope to get a piece of it before it implodes.",fqjewte,2020-05-14 07:29:36,8

Once the crypto-hype train has reached your ears and it sounds like it's all going nuts and that you think you're going to make a crazy profit, you most likely (99%) missed this carriage. 

Be patient and wait again. I knew about Bitcoin since it was created, then when it went Parabolic 2017 I FOMO'd in with $12K and lost 90% of my portfolio's value... It still hurts to this day, but I have never learnt a more greater lesson than that one... Since then I have traded carefully, taken small profits, reinvested profits and slightly diversified into ""more reliable"" cryptocurrencies and finally starting to recover.

Think with your head! If you feel this sense of anxiety and RUSH when clicking the BUY/SELL button, sleep on it and talk it over with someone and they will help show you if you are thinking logically, or if you're just being a Impulsive Greedy Bastard.

Then the next year I was at the park with my daughter and met another dad who asked if I had heard about bitcoin.  He was adamant about buying told me to check out his new website localbitcoin. I was living paycheck to paycheck and the price was volatile so I was a little hesitant. I had 1k in my savings and said fuck it, why not put that in bitcoin, so I got 10 at $100. 

In February of 2017 my wife was laid off and she had medical debt from 2 failed back surgeries. The price had been steady for a couple years and we needed money so I cashed it all out the next month for 14k. We used it to pay medical debt and move to a new city.

I was ready to cash out however I wasn’t really familiar with bitcoin back then so I had to do the check option that came with a $100 fee. 

So I’m sitting there about to go grocery shopping and I see the tigers vs the San Diego Padres live money line. Tigers up by 2 runs I believe in the 9th inning. -1000 odds. I figure shit I’ll just throw the $1000 on there win the $100 and just cash out. Get a full $1000 after fees instead of $900. 

Head out to the grocery store and yep, while I’m following on my phone and driving, Padres come back and win. 

I pulled over, threw up, and went back home to go to bed at 5:30pm

Edit : my wife was super pissed at the time since she had that money allocated towards bills, I told her I cashed out and the $900 was on the way before I placed that bet. At least she’s [cool now ](https://imgur.com/a/ckYWySw)",fqmvpv9,2020-05-15 04:25:22,32

OverlordQ,"Your bitcoin balance isn't a simple ledger entry saying ""You have $x BTC"", it's a bucket of things called UTXOs or Unspent Transaction Outputs. 

When you send any amount of Bitcoin to anyone (even yourself), you must reference which UTXOs you're sending. To simpify, I'll ignore fees for now.

If a business receives transactions of .1 BTC, .2 BTC, .5 BTC while they'll have a total of .8 BTC, it's split across multiple UTXOs. 

If they then need to send, for example, .3 BTC there's numerous ways to do that. They could either send both the .1 and .2 UTXOs, or they could send the .5 UTXO with .3 BTC going to the recipient and .2 BTC coming back to themselves as change. 

With the first example, we started with 3 UTXOs and ended up with 2 UTXOs. In the second, we started with 3 UTXOs, and ended up with 4. 

Bitcoin transaction fees are based on how big they are. The more UTXO Inputs you use, the larger the transaction will be. So you generally want to trend to a smaller number of UTXOs so you're spending less on fees.

In this case, the user had thousands of thousands of UTXOs of small amounts. They consolidated them from 600 smaller UTXOs to 1 larger UTXO. This means if they ever need to send a larger amount of BTC, they'll have to spend less on fees to only use 1 Input vs tens or hundreds.

Unfortunately since BTC has a constrained blocksize they're paying *a lot* in fees to do this. For one example to send $7,193.39, they're paying $984.94 in fees so they're only getting $6208.45 out. This is nearly 14% in fees. 

Another example they're sending $3124.01, paying $829.48 in fees, or **26%**

Blockstream/Core/et all have been saying this is a good thing for years so they can push  users to their custodial solutions.",fqnok5o,2020-05-15 08:23:22,14
mkgll,"I keep both and don’t assume unnecessary risk. Earn or buy more of the coin you think has the better future prospects but if you’ve got a position in both you’re in a better place than many. Most early BCHers would have more BCH today if they had waited to trade. 

The truth is, nobody knows the future. BTC could hard fork to bigger blocks and take a lot of BCH’s value prop. BCH could suffer a crippling community split over, oh, I don’t know, a funding proposal... BTC could crash and burn in spectacular fashion due to mempool backlogs Craig could finally make good on just one of his many threats and mega dump a ton of coins! I don’t know, but I prefer to position myself to win regardless even if I think that the model big-block Bitcoin has is superior to small blocks.

And selling all your coins in the opposing fork often has the effect of making people a little crazy. When your income depends on the other person being wrong, it can be hard to be charitable towards certain types of information.

Big picture question: Can bitcoin hit a new ATH in the midst of a global recession? depression? 

For every 1% decrease in US GDP (annualized) how much of a headwind does that create for BTC? 

Is there any strong evidence that bitcoin has transitioned to a flight to safety asset? If not, then is bitcoin still dependent on the macro environment (SP500) being positive?

nullc,"Some number of months back J.K. Rowling was the target of a social media drama-mob because she [tweeted support](https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1207646162813100033) of a researcher who made a comment which was considered by some to be insufficiently sensitive with respect to trangendered persons.

The firestorm died down after a while. But it could have continued.  J.K. could have found herself severed from her banking relationships and unable to receive payments for her publications-- just like Visa and Mastercard instituted a blockade against donations to Wikileaks years ago. Not because she broke any law, but because she was accused by an angry mob of supporting someone who was accused of being politically incorrect.

Isolated from her funding she might have found it much harder to endure the other negative consequences of being the target of a social media lynch-mob.

Bitcoin fixes this. Bitcoin is money that has minimal to no dependency on the whims of third parties. With Bitcoin you can't have your access to your coins or your ability to transfer them cut of just because someone has decided they don't like you or that you're a political liability.

Bitcoin protects your right to believe right things and your right to believe wrong things. It doesn't free you from the consequences of your actions, but it helps narrow the consequences to ones appropriate according to the rule of law rather than popular sentiment.

Of course, just having your money and your ability to pay and be paid protected from third party whim isn't enough-- but it's a good start and way to have some piece of mind. As the saying goes, good fences make for good neighbours. Keeping other people out of your finances is a ""good fence"". How you manage, earn, or spend your money is none of my business and vice versa.

Part of the reason we have money in the first place is specifically separate our judgement of people from our ability to transact with them. Once money was invented we could use it sell someone an apple without having to judge if they're a good person or not and without being to worried that our money would be dishonored by others because we accepted it from a person of the wrong politics, religion, or race. Money was just money: Fungible and equal. 

But prior to Bitcoin all electronic money systems relied heavily on trusting a third parties. This trust also implies intrusive regulation and surveillance just to keep the whole thing working.

2. You start a crypto project and make some money, then you take parts of this money to establish a non-profit foundation to further support the project. Why is it not enough to donate parts of your funds? Why would it be ""morally correct"" to hand over all of the profits you made with the company that developed IOTA?
3. Bitcoin is slow and inefficient - that is exactly what IOTA is trying to solve. Why on earth would we use a more than 10 year old project as a benchmark for choosing a good and fast crypto primitive?

the # of places you can actually spend Bitcoin has been dropping with every day. The transaction fees to move Bitcoin have been rising with every day.

Higher transaction fees = people will start looking for alternatives, higher transaction fees = you lose the small time holders who waste $20 here or there to prop up the price .

and sure BTC right now can be used to buy other crypto...but what do you think will happen to the price of Bitcoin when exchanges switch from using BTC pairs to stablecoin pairs?  And make no mistake, that move is absolutely coming as the cost of doing business in BTC increases and the high BTC transaction cost drive people away from trading.

However I must say it seems you don't understand bitcoin. It is designed to have high fees because that is what will pay for security.

Bitcoin is stuck with this issue because of how it was designed by satoshi and its impossible to have a **consensual** hard fork to fix it. Bitcoin can only change via hardfork with near 100% consensus. Otherwise you just split your network in half and eventually half again and you go the way of the romans via constant civil wars and dictators. You already see this playing out with the pretenders, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV.

Ethereum gets around this by being pseudo decentralized which is of great benefit for solving problems now, however could turn into real chaos as politics starts to creep its way into development.

&gt;The platform is simple. When elected, I will swear in, walk to the White House, and sign one executive order. This executive order will lay out the process for dissolving the federal government in a peaceful, orderly manner. 

#

&gt;Some agencies will be very easy to do away with, like those that perform only regulatory functions like the Department of Education, or those that perform completely illegitimate functions, like the IRS.

#

&gt;Upon winning the election, our transition team will immediately begin the rollout of a new, decentralized monetary system by which we can pay back the American people and fund the bankruptcy process of the federal government. Every American will be issued 1,000 Americoins by social security number. Americoin will be a cryptocurrency that functions similar to Bitcoin. 

#

&gt;More important than the politics of this campaign, is the education about the nature of government and how we can apply it to live more free NOW! This campaign is about encouraging people to minimize the role of government in their lives and their role in empowering government. When you understand government properly, you relate to it properly. One of the most important ways to disempower government is to stop paying taxes (legally or illegally.) One of the most effective ways to do this is to stop using government money, and with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, this is easier than ever.

baconcheeseburgarian,"&gt; If I wanted to ""store wealth"" I wouldn't use something as incredibly volatile as Bitcoin. I'd use something like actual gold.

Gold is just as volatile within it's price band because currencies themselves are volatile and are swayed by macro-economic factors.

The difference with storing value in actual gold vs bitcoin is you have to defend that gold.  You have to transport that gold.  You gotta sell it for less than its market rate to convert it back to cash you can buy things with.

I dont have those issues with Bitcoin.  It's monetary policy makes it a better long term investment than gold despite the short term price volatility.

romannumbers96,"First, I'm not a lawyer, nor am I in California.  However, I am pretty decently versed in general ADA issues (I've been working on a lot of ADA advocacy in my field, which includes a lot of places with MUCH more clear violations for the last year or so).  This is a HUGE post OP.  The Tl;Dr is that you aren't going to make this go away unless some very specific circumstances apply to you (again, with my limited understanding of CA law in particular, they might not apply, but they would be worth bringing to your lawyer), but there are some ways to mitigate this and to keep an eye on it in the future.

The problem is, in this sort of case, the onus is on you to prove it's not an issue.  Others saying that ""if you have video of other people with disabilities not having an issue they have no case"" is absolutely wrong.  The way these laws work, is that a violation is a violation when it comes to something in the letter of it in these cases, which is unfortunate because it weaponizes assholery like this against small business owners.  It's just like if you, say, didn't have proper refrigeration for health code or didn't have proper fire alarms or your building was made entirely out of plywood; it's a part of the building code.

That doesn't mean that there aren't some other options.  Nobody's mentioned anything about your landlord.  Look at your lease; something tells me there's something there on where the responsibility for property maintenance falls (which keeping up to code falls under).  If you find that it says your landlord's responsible?  Great!  Their problem now.  If not?  Well, you've got another potential avenue to make this go away.

While I'm not sure about California code specifically (and your lawyer that you have might be able to find this in particular), many states have built in ""grandfathering"" of buildings that were in place before the ADA.  When we're talking renovations, we're talking major structural changes; putting in a new freezer, for example, or some other change in your building that occurred since the ADA was passed.  If your building hasn't been renovated beyond a fresh coat of paint and bringing in some fancy bitcoin machines since the California ADA passed, and they have that clause?  Congratulations!  You tell this person to pound sand, and prepare all the permits to show that since you haven't renovated, you're in the clear.

In addition, does your store have any sort of wheelchair ramp or the like?  If not, then this case is even more in their favor.  If so, and if they could have taken an alternate route to avoid said step? 
 You could likely take it to a judge and have a good chance of getting it thrown out.  Not a perfect one, mind you; even their case of having the letter of the law on their side is very much one that isn't airtight.  But you'd have a good chance of being able to point out that the suit is frivolous.

Also, were you only given a demand letter, or actually served?  There's a good chance they just wanted to send a scary demand letter, since they know a lot of small business (and keep in mind, this PREYS on small businesses) will pay the smaller sum because they could never afford the larger one.  If you're served, always pay attention to it (and you have a lawyer already, which is a step above a lot of people) but until then, there's a non-zero chance that ignoring it would help.  I would advise against this because with this sort of ambulance-chaser they might still come after you to get any cash they can.  In addition, you said that this lawyer was well known for this.  I remember reading that a lawyer had been disbarred for this exact action.  Might be worth looking into that a bit further.

Now, some practical advice, especially if you don't have the wheelchair ramp: I'd look into getting one or cutting that step down if at all possible.  The thing is, while this suit is VERY much an asshole move, many of these accommodations end up being good for many people.  For example, it'll be far easier for vendors to get into the gas station to deliver goods if you have a ramp instead of a step, and they're likely going to visit far more often than someone in a wheelchair, even if that sort of cut is intended for people in wheelchairs.  

I'd also make as another commenter said and hire a CASP inspector to give your whole building a once-over.  If they decide to go to court it will look REALLY good on your end to say ""hey, we went to make the proper changes.""  There's no world where, for a one-time visit, 2 million dollars, or even 13k, is a reasonable penalty for your business, especially if they did their due diligence.  But they could refer you to be fined by the government for the violation, and taking steps to ensure compliance is important.  I would also go a step further; if there are any disability groups local to you that you have contact with, or even don't have contact with (ARC is my personal go-to, and any self-advocacy organizations are great as well if you need one), ask them to come out and start supporting them.  The idea of ""possession being 9/10ths of the law"" also goes for branding.  There's a reason people play their most sympathetic traits up on the court room.  If it goes that far, they'll paint you as a hater of the disabled (which, as someone who IS disabled and advocated for the disabled, is patently false 95% of the time when there are these violations).  You likely won't go this far.  But for a small business like yours, goodwill pays in other ways.

Lastly: it might be worth it to pay the 13k.  There's a non-zero chance of the lawyer ""discovering another client who happened to find another violation,"" and coming back for another 13k.  But if the options for the case being bs don't pan out, or you don't have the strength to go through all the rigmarole to risk the case in court or fight back before court, 13k could very much be a good way to end it.

I know there's a LOT here.  I hope at least SOME of it helps, and if any actual lawyers with more than my advocate's understanding of the ADA want to chime in and correct me on things I might misunderstand, I would appreciate it.  Though the last thing I want you to leave with: OP, your business did NOTHING wrong morally.  Sometimes, the letter of the law errs on the side of caution in comparison to the spirit.",fqyghdw,2020-05-18 05:43:17,7

RetardIdiotTrader,"There's a certain psychology to wanting to own altcoins. I'll break it down for you.

For the vast majority of people, they don't have the available capital to buy more than a couple of Bitcoins right now because who's going to spend five figures on speculative, magic internet money in the midst of a recession?

When BTC is at $20k+, there will be few people able to afford that much, but people will want in on the hype train. Owning less than one of a Bitcoin isn't that attractive. .3? .6? That's no fun. They want to own **lots**. It's also one of the reasons why I first bought lots of Litecoin instead of a few Bitcoins.

So, what do they resort to buying? Altcoins, and lots of it, because they want to feel like they own a lot of something instead of a fraction of a single coin. For this simple fact (along with some others), there will always be variety of different coins that will do better than BTC percentage wise, will have superior technology and people will be buying them no matter the underlying fundamentals because who cares about fundamentals when they're making money?

This psychology creates bubbles and was one of the primary reasons for our last bull run. If you take a look at the dominance chart, you will notice that the BTC dominance went down sharply during the height of our last bull run.

The same thing will happen the next bull run. I expect the dominance to retrace sharply to the 40% range and certain altcoins to gain their ratios back.

I do agree that the majority of the alts will not see their light of day again. I do expect new alts to arise however.",fqzyen3,2020-05-18 14:09:38,7

well folks, the whole world is mooning. 

Up. 
It's the only thing on the menu. Everywhere. 

I can't shake the feeling that this is a set up for an ugly retrace. Can it really be this easy? Just the possibility of a vaccine sets off a global orgasm. 

And yes, the economic data _is_ starting to rebound. But there was nowhere to go but up for a lot of these metrics. Let's take restaurants (OpenTable data): If we go from 0% to 60% of normal from mid-April to mid-June, how much should we be celebrating? 

A lot of indicators are still 90% from normal. TSA travel. Movie box office. Mobility is one that's bouncing back. And, relatedly, gasoline sales. 

But I just wonder if the depth of the downturn is priced in. And the fact that the economy isn't just some on/off switch. Flip it off. And then, with a flick of Trump's magical finger, it's on! 

Anyway, I'm definitely expecting a period of reckoning, where the hoped for V simply doesn't materialize. And people start worrying it'll actually be an ugly L.

And what's any of this have to do with bitcoin? Maybe a lot. If this ""Mission Accomplished"" narrative doesn't hold, then maybe we return to the volatility of March. Probably not quite that bad. But those shifts in perspective can come quickly. It takes just takes one punch to the face to knock off the rose colored glasses. 

Open interest is coming off its lows too. Not where we were in March, but approaching the May 9 number. What's the bitmex funding story? If longs have been paying for their leverage for a while, that could be another sign. 

Blah blah blah... I guess my point boils down to this: Don't get too comfortable.

In terms of cryptocurrency as an ""investment"", I'm not terribly bullish.  However, as a technology, I find it fascinating and I think it will eventually find its place in mainstream commerce.

The two biggest arenas in crypto that **interest** (*pun intended*) me are DeFi and stablecoins, because they really help to bridge some gaps between the fiat and crypto world.  I've always been interested in crypto arbitrage, however, it's too competitive for me to ever really make any money in it.  Frontrunners, transaction fees, withdrawal fees, etc. make it too difficult.

I think the future for cryptocurrency is bright, and I think Ethereum 1.0 has paved the way for many great things to come (and of course, none of it would have been possible if Bitcoin hadn't come along).  As new solutions emerge to help solve issues with transaction costs, speed, and total throughput, things can only get better from here.

SwagtimusPrime,"I love DeFi. It's probably the most useful use case of crypto so far. You can lend money to anyone in the world and earn interest on it, higher than a traditional savings account in your bank allows. There is no middleman, no fees besides transaction fees. No office hours, no time limits (you can pull out your money at anytime). Decentralized, trustless, feeless finance. Absolutely bonkers.

Stablecoins allow you to send money to anyone - at a stable price. No volatility involved. Worth mentioning: DAI, because it is actually decentralized as opposed to USDT or USDC.

And the whole loan/lend thing is just the tip of the iceberg of DeFi - want to own a house on the blockchain and get rent payments? [RealT](https://realt.co/) got you covered (not really decentralized, but it still enables the average joe to participate in the housing market). Want to insure the smart contract that holds your tokenized house? Use Nexus.mutual to insure against smart contract risk.

Want to participate in a no-loss lottery? Yes, you heard that right. A lottery that doesn't cost you anything. The stablecoins of the participants get loaned out and the pooled interest of all participants is collected and goes to one lucky winner: pooltogether.com

You can buy calls and puts on Ethereum using Opyn. Then there's Bitcoin on Ethereum - wBTC or tBTC, or soon RenBTC - that you can use to earn interest on your Bitcoin, decentralized.

If you want to learn more, here's a nice list with brief explainers about different projects: https://defipulse.com/defi-list/

It is nice to finally trade into strength.  Even as Bitcoin dips lower the ratio acts as a shock absorber pushing us back to 210.  While there's only so much punishment it can take, if it holds and BTC gets back above the 1hr 100MA (9560 right now) I am expecting our next leg higher into $230- $240 and a move for BTC to break 10,000.  Approaching 280-290 by the end of the month becomes more realistic if BTC taps into ~10,500.

Miners are starting to drop off, but at a slow pace due to the price increase.  The next BTC difficulty adjustment hits in ~26hrs with a -7.2% change (and rising).  How BTC handles that will be key because come ~June 1st we may be looking at a massive (possibly -28%) adjustment.  It would be a miner bloodbath if the price wasn't significantly higher.

So some of my parameters roughly summarized:

1. BTC back over 1hr 100MA (9560 right now) before market open Tuesday

2. Making attempts at 10k or over 10k before next bitcoin difficulty adjustment in ~26hrs

3. BTC at or above 10500 by around ~June 1st (whenever the actual difficulty bomb is)


If any of these steps do not happen (or don't look like they will) then I will be opening a hedge short at that point.  Depending on how far away we are from the goal, I will be potentially closing longs.  Dates are based on estimated block# so they can shift.",fr3q9c4,2020-05-19 13:42:49,9

mushroomsarefriends,"When it comes to Bitcoin in particular, the system was never designed with the idea of operating off transaction fees. The idea was that initially the block reward would keep people mining, then eventually as that reward declines, some other solution would need to be found.

/u/Nullc aka Greg Maxwell was aware of this problem, so he sought a solution in the form of a limit on transaction capacity. This would require people to add a fee to their transactions, to be included in a block. As the block reward goes down, transactions would start paying for the system.

There are a number of problems with this idea. As has been pointed out to Maxwell by people, the idea of a fee market doesn't work, because it requires you to have a reliable and stable level of congestion. That simply doesn't happen. The median transaction fee has varied from 30 dollar during the height of the bubble, to a low of 10 cents when people lose interest in the system. What we see instead is that when transaction fees start paying for the system, the system implodes, as people move to alternatives (LTC/BCH, or they simply buy their drugs from the guy they used to know in college).

The second problem is that it doesn't work from a game theoretic perspective. Transaction fees screw up the economic incentives. Imagine there's no block reward. Some other dude just mined a block with 1 BTC worth of transactions. Now there are no transactions left with any fee. What's the rational move? Mine a worthless block? No, you're going to ignore his block, mine your own block with those transactions and hope that you find another block so that his block is orphaned.

So that's a big risk, but right now the most likely outcome appears to be that miners will simply turn off their rigs when there are not enough transaction fees. This decreases the rate at which blocks are found and forces users to overbid each other to get included in a block. In other words, they start throttling throughput. That's what we're seeing now: [Weird periods during which there are hardly any blocks and transaction fees jump up, followed by a return to normal.](https://fork.lol/pow/hashrate)

The big problem with that of course is that for a while users will overbid each other, but in practice it merely means a bad user experience: It now becomes expensive to use the system and unpredictable to tell when your transaction will be confirmed. Those users will move to alternatives (LTC/BCH, the guy they knew in college, etc). When that happens the price will probably collapse, which merely makes the problem worse, as the miners will now have even less incentive to mine.",fr60lck,2020-05-20 04:50:14,13

I still believe the real bullrun is later. That's why I'm out of position and not trading. And that's why I have all these unnecessary aggressive conversations here.

Of course it's possible that the hype echo from the halving gives us prices north of 10k, but we will never see a new ATH under these circumstances.  


The log chart of the bitcoin price from 2010 until now shows clearly that the bullrun usually starts months after a halving.  
We have corona and a very threatening and possible second wave that pressures the economy even further, and also summer is coming.  


The halving itself didn't create green needles and I personally doubt it that we just go up from here, break ATH and go happily home. I just don't.At this point I usually would bring up the memqueue and the scalability trilemma but trader don't care since they have money on exchanges and they just buy and sell apart from memqueue problems.  


Still, in the future it will be a huge problem. If they make lightning less centralized it's even better. There can be a great future for BTC and crypto, but I don't buy the bullish sentiment in the middle of a crisis.

Obv plus 200ema will show you the overall trend. As far as other things. 

You can use Trend indicators: trend flex (look for price divergence, look this up if you need to) TDST sequence works on 3m candles pretty well even though it was intended for bitcoin. Bollinger bands are for volatility, use a Bollinger cloud and change it to 3 standard deviations in place of 2 (lots of reasons for this) Also TTM trends and/or harmonic patterns, you could learn candlestick patterns or trust a script like this one:


https://usethinkscript.com/threads/harmonic-patterns-indicator-for-thinkorswim-zigzag-bat-butterfly-abcd.69/

It will label almost every pattern in real time, not much repainting either. The thing to remember with using patterns is.... most people don’t know many patterns so the code may show patterns appearing and because humans don’t have them memorized they’ll be no price reaction. 

However the Strong Henry pattern almost always gets a big move.

Also, if Visa didn't want you to donate to Edward Snowden or Chelsea Manning, they wouldn't have a say because they never touch your money.

Prince_Farquatt,"Always interesting times in the world of Bitcoin. My hope is that regardless of what Technical Analysis you use, either you were positioned short or sold at the top before the 3% correction earlier today.

For about the last 16 hours or so, the 4H Intraday chart has been reflecting a price pinned beneath the upper trendline on increasing volume, while the lows have been pinned around $9,600 indicating a strong move was imminent. The failure to break the $9,840 price level on heavy volume signaled insufficient buyers in the market to push the Bitcoin price higher into breakout, sparking the first leg of the Wyckoff Distribution. Sometimes those bags can just get too heavy.

[4H Intraday Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ddfDH3AU/)

The Intraday chart reflects a low price target of $9,260 *should* have been realized \[$9,860 - ((($9,860 - $9,560)\*3)\*2/3)\]. In the end the bottom part of the new trade range was discovered at $9,300 or $40 above the target price, which is well within the delta I’ve experienced using the Vertical Count Method in Point and Figure. Also, $9,300 is a significant psychological support level.

Once the breakdown went beyond $9,500 (three boxes below the prior low), a Low Pole Warning was signaled. A Low Pole Reversal generally results in a 50% retrace in the breakdown range from the prior low ($9,560) to the bottom of the breakdown ($9,300), which would have targeted a retrace to the $9,440 level. The Low Pole Reversal realized the $9,440 price target, stalled, and then pushed higher as shorts covered their positions.

We are currently seeking the upper end of the new Intraday trade range. I speculate it will be around the $9,540 level.

If we look at a higher timeframe (1D), the most recent high topped out at $9,940 which was the same level as the Secondary Test of the upper range of this Wyckoff Distribution. A double top (which is Bullish in Point and Figure) was formed which broke the upper trendline of the formation, suggesting bullish bias and the Parabolic SAR flipped bullish as well. 

[1D Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/0wjxkKnl/)

While the signals all reflect bullish sentiment, I feel we will more likely test the lower end of the trading range ($8,120) and establish a Sign of Weakness (SOW) somewhere between $8,120 and $7,700 before retracing to the upper end of the trading range ($10,060) and possibly hitting $10,300 in a final Upward Thrust before completing the Wyckoff Distribution Phase.

&amp;nbsp;

As of this writing, it's 12c USD for 2 minute confirmation, which *isn't even possible on bitcoin*, and it's 9c USD for a confirmation in under 5 minutes. *Which is still faster than bitcoin.*

&amp;nbsp;

When comparing fees between ETH and BTC, people who attempt to misrepresent the situation like to do one of two things:

* They will conceal or ignore how much faster ETH is confirming transactions - not comparing like-for-like confirmation timeframes such as 10 minutes, 30 minutes, or

* They will include contract execution transaction fees on ETH when comparing to BTCs value-transfer-only fees.

To explain that second point, similar to BTC the ETH fees scale with the amount of data/work, and calling and executing a smart contract will always take more data/work than just sending money. As a result, **a contract execution will always cost more than a plain value transfer** - and that's reasonable, and makes sense. But BTC *can't do contract executions at all*, so people trying to distort facts to support their positions inflate the stated amount being spent on fees on ETH by including those more-expensive transactions that *can't even exist* on BTC. ""The average fee per transaction on the ETH network right now is X!"" they will say - never mentioning that many of the transactions were complex contract executions, and that if those are removed for comparison, the average spent for pure value transfer is far lower.

CombustibleBitcoiner,"There's some misinformation in this post.

First, Craig Wright did not claim to own this particular address specifically, as far as we know. The list of addresses you linked to was provided by Steve Shadders, CTO of nChain. Since Mr. Wright said he could not provide an accurate list of the bitcoin he mined, he offered to ""narrow down"" the list by giving six criteria to Shadders and asking him to generate a list from it. (Unspent outputs, least significant byte of the nonce in a certain range, etc.) The list was meant to be a superset (ie - over-inclusive) of the blocks Mr. Wright mined. 

Shadders delivered the list, but he screwed it up badly and included thousands of blocks he should not have. [Read more about the ""Shadders Bug"" here](https://np.reddit.com/r/bitcoinsv/comments/cr94sd/steve_shadders_lied_in_court_or_is_a_moron_or/). 

This particular block (3654) was not one of the erroneous blocks, but that doesn't mean Mr. Wright actively claimed it. In fact, [73 blocks](https://np.reddit.com/r/bsv/comments/gneg0n/of_course_the_cult_is_up_up_and_away_by_such_an/fr9t83x/) have already been spent from the ""Shadders List"".

Wright has since submitted what he says is an accurate list of the blocks he mined, but that list is not public, though there are numerous problems with it, including the fact that a few of the blocks have already been spent. Read more about the problems with it [here](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.521536/gov.uscourts.flsd.521536.500.5.pdf) starting on page 20.

Bottom line: Wright didn't **necessarily** claim this address. However, he is undoubtedly a fraud and not Satoshi.",fr9zf8w,2020-05-21 05:22:34,9

UsernameIWontRegret,"&gt;Bitcoin is exactly what it set out to be. 

1,000% wrong. Go back and read the Bitcoin white paper. 

Here’s the thing about Bitcoin. The main arguments for it aren’t unique to Bitcoin, they apply to cryptocurrency as a whole. 

Most people see disinflation is a good thing, it’s not. A steady inflation rate is necessary for the growth of a currency. The number 1 way to create wealth inequality is to have 0% inflation. The population will keep growing but the money supply won’t, and the rich get richer by holding on and the poor get poorer as they need to fight over decreasing scraps.",fradb99,2020-05-21 08:21:11,14
concernedcustomer33,"You raise some valid points, but the bullish case for ETH doesn't depend on people thinking the way you describe.  The bullish case depends on crypto having tremendous growth potential as a flexible global settlement layer with countless as yet unimagined applications.  As a candidate to fill that role, Ethereum's superiority over Bitcoin isn't an assumption in need of further investigation; it's an objective fact.  Could another chain end up being the backbone of general purpose distributed economic interaction?  Of course, but it won't be Bitcoin.  

BTC may indeed have a durable foothold as a digital reserve asset, and I encourage everyone in the crypto world to own some.  Both coins can succeed together; there's no need for one of them to dominate every use case.  That said, I find it hard to convince myself of BTC's inherent value, even if I consider it prudent to own some.  I have no such concerns about ETH.",fradfkl,2020-05-21 08:22:25,7

bitvote,"Quick thoughts: Feels like the energy and emotion behind the bitcoin rally have faded. 

Pre-halving excitement/fomo is done. We've had a few of big name mainstream investors say positive things about bitcoin.  And bitcoin plugs nicely into the BRRrrr meme-field. 

Some of that stuff is positive long term, but my sense is that the short term (next 1-3mos) energy may have peaked. And that leaves us vulnerable to a retest of some price level. Maybe it's $9k and we bounce between 9-10k for a while. Or maybe it's $8k and we bounce between 8-10k for a couple months. 

But the longer we spend at the lower end of one of those price levels, the lower the FOMO energy. And the more likely that we might drop down into a new zone. 

Overall I think there's a good chance we revisit $6k by July. Given how much is happening each week, there's a lot that could go down between now and July. And max pain feels like it's down. 

I've been rebuying here and there. And I just set up a daily buy on the Cash app. But I've got a lot of cash right now and it's waiting for $6k. Which also makes my bias explicit: Hoping for lower prices to rebuy :)",frcz2o5,2020-05-22 02:08:10,9

TheGreatMuffin,"A node is a software that verifies your bitcoin transactions for you (implicitly it also verifies the overall supply of bitcoin, protects you from fraud from third parties, from ""fake"" bitcoin etc) and gives you a higher level of privacy (you don't leak sensitive information to your wallet's nodes, f.ex).  

Here's a great explainer by P. Wuille (although it doesn't even mention the privacy benefits):  

&gt; One of Bitcoin's strengths - the most important in my opinion even - is the low degree of trust you need in others.   
&gt;  
&gt;    
&gt; If you use a full node for your incoming transactions, you know that there was no cheating anytime in the history of your coins:  
&gt;  
&gt; * Nobody ever created money out of nothing (except for mimers, and only according to a well-defined schedule).  
&gt; 
&gt; * Nobody ever spent coins without holder their private key.  
&gt; 
&gt; * Nobody spent the same coins twice (but see further).  
&gt; 
&gt; * Nobody violated any of the other tricky rules that are needed to keep the system in check (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, ...).  
&gt; 
&gt; ... with one exception: because there is a need to pick a winner in presence of multiple competing valid versions of the ledger, (a majority of) miners have the authority to pick the version of the block chain that wins. This means their power is limited to choosing the order in which otherwise valid transactions occur, up to and including the right to delay them indefinitely. But they cannot make invalid transaction look valid to a full node.  
&gt;  
&gt; If you are not running a full node, the amount of trust you're placing in others increases.  
&gt; 
&gt; SPV nodes (such as some mobile clients, and Multibit) place a blind trust in the majority of miners, without checking validity of the blockchain they produce. It still requires a majority of miners to mislead an SPV node, but they can make it believe anything (including ""You received 10000000 BTC!""). The reason why this does not happen is because full nodes would not accept such blocks, and assuming a large portion of the ecosystem does rely on full nodes, miners who do this would not see their blocks accepted by the larger economy, resulting in them wasting money.  
&gt;  
&gt; Centralized services (most webwallets) make the user trust whatever the site says. They can claim anything.
&gt;  
&gt; So I hope you now see the importance of full nodes in this model. If you run a full node somewhere on the network, and nobody looks at the transactions it validates, it is indeed contributing to the network, but it is not helping with the reduction of trust.  
&gt;  
&gt; Look at it another way: if only a few large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem were running full nodes, it only requires a malicious intent, or an attack/threat against them, to change the system's rules, as nobody else is validating.  
&gt;  
&gt; Doing transactions in the Bitcoin ecosystem helps the Bitcoin currency. Running a full node helps the network. Using a full node helps you and the ecosystem reduce the need for trust.

The year is 2140 and the last BTC halving has just happened.  The block reward is now 0 and the final miner has converted their BTC to WBTC on the ETH blockchain.

Without a block reward, Bitcoin miners only have transaction fees to rely on. But since there are no more transactions, there are no more fees, and no incentives for miners to keep validating blocks. The Bitcoin blockchain is now a dying wasteland.  The last bastion of survival for its tokens are now on another Planet -- Ethereum.

True to the sacred accords of EIP1559, transaction fees are still paid in ETH.  Each time a WBTC transfer happens, a small portion of it is converted to ETH to pay for the transaction fee.  The relentless march of slow and steady WTBC&lt;&gt; ETH conversion continues....

The year is now 2240, and there is only a single satoshi of WBTC left.  It has become a curiosity, to be sold in an auction held outside the steps at the Temple of Vitalik.  Its buyer then ceremonially burns it - sending it to the genesis address, from which all tokens were spawned.

-lightfoot,"I think wbtc might be a massive milestone in crypto history. 

As I understand it, Ethereum is eating bitcoin’s traffic and tx fees by bringing btc onto the ethereum chain and making that btc cheaper and faster to move and also more interoperable as wbtc (*edit: or some similar (decentralised?) alternative)*. When POS is in action, an ETH tx will be vastly cheaper than a BTC one; there’ll be no competition. It’ll be preferable for anyone looking to buy or sell bitcoin (including exchanges?) to use wrapped bitcoin WBTC. 

I find this idea really exciting and I think it’s creeping up on people. 

Sounds crazy but ETH might flip BTC much more quickly than expected if wrapping BTC becomes common, as it’ll render the BTC blockchain redundant. It makes financial sense to wrap BTC as tx are cheaper and faster and you can use dexes, so surely wrapping btc is only going to accelerate... Am i missing something here?

Is ethereum going to eat bitcoin??",frhxyp9,2020-05-23 08:07:10,15
decibels42,"It makes BTC more useful, but you’re taking on more risk to use it in Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem than you would be if you just used/held ETH. 

And as we all have been saying, ETH does everything BTC does and more. Even the store of value argument for BTC will diminish over time as ETH’s increases.

BTCs SOV argument is that it’s a SOV because it’s a SOV. It’s circular. At best, it’s based on the fact that it was the first crypto + it has the most hash power/liquidity. But (1) it being first doesn’t necessarily mean it’ll always be first and (2) hash power/liquidity can change/decrease.

Meanwhile, with ETH, it’s SOV argument is strong, and will only get stronger over time. 

-	For starters, you always have the option to use your ETH to stake and earn interest, like a bond (can BTC do that without depending on the ponzi narrative?). 
-	In terms of issuance relative to BTC (which is a common FUD argument against BTC right now), ETHs issuance is going to be lower than BTCs for about a decade when we switch to POS (0.5% or less for ETH; BTCs is around 2% until 2024, and then 1% until 2028). ETHs issuance may even go negative by then. 
-	Also, the SOV case for ETH is stronger than BTCs because there is actual demand for ETH in hundreds of different use cases. ETH is actually being used for something other than being a digital paperweight. Meaning, there’s “insurance” about ETHs price simply by the fact that it’s now become the internet of value  and tons and tons of use cases require ETH (compare this to the circular arguments for BTC, which is based on a house of cards).

These points are very underrated right now, but will become more clear as time goes on. Particularly, the last bullet is *highly* underrated and rarely talked about.

—

Bonus: for example purposes, here’s a non-exhaustive list of use cases for ETH that’ll partly act as it’s “insurance”/justification for its SOV argument (as well as a very rough estimate for how ETH will be used amongst those use cases), 

see /u/argbargman2’s recent post, here:

https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/godvib/_/frguhfu/?context=1

&gt;\~30% to be on exchanges, liquidity pools, or cold wallet hodl's is normal I think. The rest will be spread among various other use cases. So far, the ones I can see are: 

&gt;* Staking - 1 million validators (\~30 million ETH staked) is a good target for security at full scale
* DeFi - borrowing against ETH or loaning to short sellers (\~3 million ETH locked right now)
* Interop-as-a-service - e.g. tBTC. Bitcoin isn't the only chain that it's useful to build a bridge to. Other chains will want to bridge to ETH. Private ETH forks will likely use the public chain as common infrastructure to interact with each other. All of these bridges will be collateralized by ETH
* Layer 2 - I would not be surprised to see plenty of L2 implementations require aggregators to be bonded with ETH.

&gt;ETH will probably flow between various use cases like this, depending on the yield offered by each. In the future, I could see the breakdown looking something like this:

&gt;* \~30% staked securing the PoS chain
* \~5-15% in DeFi (depends on DEX adoption)
* \~10% in IaaS
* \~15% in L2
* \~10-20% on CEX's
* \~20% in cold wallets or other",frhzkvm,2020-05-23 08:22:34,5

FredCWilson,"5 Billion? Those are rookie numbers we need to get those numbers Up Up Up..5 Trillion..10 Trillion Come on now we can do it..

&gt;Based on 5 cents per kWh, the Bitcoin network needs to spend roughly $335,000 every hour, Alex de Vries, a blockchain specialist at Big Four accounting firm PwC, told Decrypt. **That means someone has to be on hand to buy nearly $8 million worth of new Bitcoin a day for cash**—just to secure the system. 

&gt;Those costs are putting the squeeze on miners right now. 

&gt;They earn 6.25 BTC every 10 minutes in block rewards. At $9,000 per BTC, that equates to $340,000 an hour. At the moment, they have to sell every BTC they mine to pay electricity costs. (Previous to the halving event on May 12, it was 12.5 BTC, so they were earning more.) The average costs will drop to 2 to 3 cents per kWh between May and September, de Vrie said.

Everyone keeps posting his non-explained TA that is nothing more than an assumption, literally based on nothing.   
In the march-crash bitcoin followed.   
There was a nice bounce and a good run towards the halving but since then, there is no reason for a pump left, hence it's going down since then. And Bitcoin is no Gold, nor safe haven for the world. Just a tiny fraction of people know how to use it, can or want to use it as a hedge.   


The following months are probably worse than what we've seen economy wise and unemployed people are not so reckless to put the rest of their money in a highly volatile asset like BTC.   


Also, there are millions of bitcoins in the hands of whales and even crypto funds from grayscale (and other big VC's)  are on the table and arguably against a bull in the future because they also own other assets and to cover the losses in the foreseeable future, what do you think they will do with all the crypto assets if a depression kicks in?   


a) sell with reasonable ROI, rather sooner than later    


b) keep it until they can't afford their rent in their expensive buildings, yachts and running costs?

The estimated cost to mine BTC is averaging around $15k per BTC post halving.  With optimistic costs and transaction income it goes down to ~$12k at best.  For China the advantage is huge and it may be as low as 6-8k per BTC.  For them they don't care if they ruin BTC and make it a ""China coin"".  They will keep selling and bringing the price down to try to bankrupt all of the other miners.  And it's working.


Hash rate is dropping like a rock and we keep getting unheard of difficulty drops as miners shut down.  We are about to get the first back to back difficulty drop in Bitcoin's history.

ArticMine,"There is a huge misconception that all electricity is created equal implicit in the environmental / global warming argument against proof of work mining. This is the case for Bitcoin and even more pronounced for Monero. https://www.newscientist.com/article/2224037-bitcoins-climate-change-impact-may-be-much-smaller-than-we-thought/

The key point is that POW mining by seeking the lowest cost electricity tends to seek sources of electricity that have no or very lower economic value for example over capacity in remote hydro installations, off peak power etc.  The growth in renewable energy sources in particular solar and wind will increase these over capacity issues. For example: 

Consider a house that has enough solar capacity to meet its winter needs. In the summer there will be significant excess capacity. Furthermore if there is wide adoption of solar there will also be a very poor market to sell the excess power during the summer months. Mining Monero becomes a very attractive option of the this excess solar electricity capacity.  

A different but related example is the value of the heat produced by POW mining. If one heats say an apartment with electric resistive heating, then one can mine Monero at an effective zero electricity cost, since dissipating 1 kWh in an electric restive heater produces the same amount of heat as running Monero miners that consume 1 kW for one hour. 

Monero has in addition very significant advantages over Bitcoin here because Monero can be mined with CPUs. This makes opportunistic mining to take advantage of seasonal electricity and heat pricing much more attractive. 

I have mined Monero with the primary object of producing heat as opposed to producing Monero on many occasions. Any Monero produced as a by product of heat generation becomes a bonus. Think a rebate on your heating bill payable in XMR.",frspn06,2020-05-26 04:33:25,7

The court would probably first order Craig to hand over the coins or some form of security for them so the court can distribute them. If he fails or refuses, it'll make the monetary judgment. But it depends.

I think a lack of understanding on jurisdiction is part of why some people don't understand what crypto can and can't do. It's true that a judge may have no way to actually compel the transfer of cryptocurrency. He can order and a sherrif or bailiff can try but without the passwords they simply will not succeed. But that isn't to say a judge can't make a finding of fact that the funds are yours and order a money judgment against you if you don't transfer the crypto yourself. Consequences if you fail to follow the order.

Really though the problem is they are here at all and they do not belong. We do not need more low skill immigrants to keep some businesses wages low.

I was a very very good kitchen employee. I could with 1 other person handle the orders that they used to have 4-5 low quality minimum wage people stand around doing before my time. You'd have 1 person on the grill, 1 person making burger buns, 1 person working fryers 1 person doing prep work and 1 person doing dishes.

I convinced my manager to get rid of those people and pay me more money. Or rather when people quit to not replace them.

I was making the most money in that restaurant by the time I left aside from my actual manager but the business was saving money, food quality and service times were UP and everyone was happy.

Gavin was the one Satoshi put in charge of the Bitcoin project when he left. Gavin also started the conversation about raising the block size in 2012, and started really pushing for it in 2013. I spoke with him in May 2013 about some threats I saw coming down the pipe for Bitcoin, and he told me quite frankly that the only threat he was worried about was people trying to stall the block size increase. At the time I thought that was the craziest thing, because **EVERYONE** wanted the block size to go up, people just had different ideas on how aggressive or conservative it should be. I am still in shock about how everything went down, and how accurate his fears were.

Through some of the shadiest political maneuvering I've ever seen, he was ousted from the project in 2016. He had spent years trying to gather support for the Bitcoin Foundation to ensure Bitcoin developers could get paid from sources free from conflict of interest, attempting to prevent exactly the kind of hostile takeover that was performed by Blockstream.

He was probably the most honest, pure, true believer in the crypto-utopia that Bitcoin could create, and got run out on a rail by a bunch of shithead VCs and crypto kiddies looking to get rich quick at the expense of the rest of us. Absolutely fucking shameful.",frtqurg,2020-05-26 10:19:55,8

I don't have the vanilla Coinbase app installed but I'm pretty sure (and correct me if I'm wrong) this is what it says when you buy bitcoin:

* Here's how much fees you're going to pay

If you don't agree with their price, you shouldn't use their service. Comparing their bitcoin price to the market price, or using that as some kind of divine default, is ridiculous: when you buy on Coinbase Pro you're buying from other traders and that determines the price of bitcoin. When you buy from Coinbase you buy from Coinbase, and they can set whatever price they want on it.

My plan for today is simple: If we close a daily above 9150, I am holding this, because I am still almost certain that we start and continue a huge move. If we don't I will severely reduce the position since that would indicate it's just a temporary rally in a seemingly never ending range. A close above would confirm a higher low and put us back into the old consolidation range. Consolidation ranges in a bull flag are almost always bullish. Since the pole of the flag is about 2-3k long, I am expecting the move to be that amount. Again, zoom out, and you can see that it so far looks like a bull flag.

P.S. Last time I commented, there were people who kept attacking me for being bearish at 7K. Yes, I was bearish then and I was wrong. I did long from 8k to 10K and shorted at 10k with proof on this sub and that made up for my mistake. This is similar to how Wardser was right about this bull move but was wrong tons of times before. So what if I'm right and wrong many times, or really anyone else? Traders change their minds and that's how people make money. You just have to be right more times than you're wrong.

puck2,"**Bitcoin’s Bounce Back Over $9,000 Masks a Potential Downtrend**
*By Vildana Hajric*

Bitcoin’s trading above $9,000 once again, but technical indicators suggest the largest cryptocurrency is stuck in a funk.

Though the price level may provide support, Bitcoin needs to break out of the downtrend it formed when its May high failed to take out the one reached in February. Any further rally that withers before overcoming a previous high may signal Bitcoin entered a potential downtrend, further indicating bearish sentiment.

The token is facing bearish sentiment and “a healthy pullback might be needed before it can break above the $10,000 level again,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, wrote in a note.

Technicals suggest Bitcoin could be mired in a downtrend
Bitcoin rose as much as 3.7% to $9,190 in New York trading on Wednesday. Peer coins including Dash and Litecoin also advanced.

Since its historic halving event earlier this month, which reduced the rewards miners receive, Bitcoin has been stuck in narrow range. Despite predictions the event would help push up its price, the world’s largest digital token has thus far failed to meaningfully climb above $10,000 -- though many enthusiasts forecast that a significant rally is still in the cards.

A number of high-profile investors, including Paul Tudor Jones, have in recent days voiced their preference for the token amid colossal interventions by central banks around the globe. Many argue Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could benefit in an inflationary environment.

ICYMI: Crypto Die-Hards Turn Back to Origins With Anti-Inflation Push

For Bloomberg Intelligence’s Mike McGlone, low global bond yields, increased equity market volatility and rising debt-to-GDP levels are positives for Bitcoin.

“We view the benchmark crypto as a resting bull that likely needs something to change significantly in its 10-or-so-year history to not just resume doing what it was doing: Appreciating,” he wrote in a note. Should the stock market sell off dramatically again, Bitcoin could stand to benefit.

Bitcoin is leverage. Fiat or fiat-like coins / government-issued crypto is inevitable and BTC itself will likely be a backbone and not a day-to-day payment network (maybe on lightning and 3rd layer it can be, and will be, but that will not be its primary use-case).

You're absolutely right. Leverage bitcoin into debt. Debt, today's fiat price, and interest rates are based on today. In 10 years, you'll be able to pay off that Audi, or Lambo, with a fraction of coin. Better yet, DONT pay it off because if you can hold that debt for 10 more years, every year a smaller amount of coin pays that year's payments. Maybe this year it's 0.1BTC to cover your car payment every month,, but in 10?

Especially in season of covid, you're absolutely right. Acquire hard assets via debt. Acquire means of production, land, housing, etc. Those things appreciate while debt at best remains the same.

TheGreatMuffin,"The Electrum wallet (one of the most popular desktop wallets in the space) needs to connect to a full node in order to work (which is not different from any other wallet btw). Either the user's own full node or a more or less random node on the network somewhere. In any case, in order to be able to ""talk"" to that node (to ask for balances, transactions etc), Electrum needs something like a bridge software (between the wallet and the full node).  

ElectrumX is one of such bridges (besides others like Electrums, Electrum Personal Server etc). The maintainer of the Github repo of ElectrumX seems to take the approach of ""Bitcoin = BitcoinSV"" now.  

That's not much to worry about, the original code will be maintained and developed in a fork repository, as it already happened: https://twitter.com/orionwl/status/1266045381143597057  

Nothing changes for people who currently run the ElectrumX code (remember, in order to update, you need to proactively download and install software, there is no ""push"" updates). Just that they need to go to a different Github repository for updates from now on.  

edit: also a good example that a maintainer of any Github repository has more of a janitor role than anything else...

It's mostly worth a lot because it's shiny, and we all agreed that it was worth a lot. I think bitcoin will be the same way. Bitcoin is a payment network, but that will only contribute a small fraction to it's value.

Also bitcoin has a fixed monetary policy. It is a hedge against inflation and government debt. Our dollars are becoming worth less because of this stimulus (I'm not saying that the stimulus shouldn't happen) and Bitcoin will benefit from that. It's value compared to USD will go up, even if the buying power of bitcoin doesn't go up.

GameDaw,"I've gone into it on here a few times, but basically, I had a sizeable amount of BTC on Gox, mainly as backup for daytrading if Bitfinex went down.  Exchanges went down a lot back then, so you wanted to be able to countertrade your other position on an out of commission exchange if it came to that.

However, I wasn't even trading on Mt Gox much and heard the warnings about it, so really should not have had that BTC on there. I take the blame for that. I was able to withdraw some of it, but then they just stopped processing withdrawls.  

When shit started to hit the fan, the BTC price started tanking on the Gox exchange, while was still normal on other exchanges, so I did make the smart move to sell my BTC and then just buy back even more a few minutes later at a much lower price.   I think it got down to $100 at the end, when the price on the other exchanges was $400.  I doubled the amount I had on there in a few hours. 

It was clear that it would be shut down soon and the big question was did you want to have a BTC balance or a fiat balance when it did. I went with BTC.

So then the exchange did shut down officially, and when that news hit, I was in chatroom and heard it quickly.  I shorted the market pretty hard (but not nearly aggressively enough) and in a few minutes, I made even more BTC profit on that trade than I had lost on Gox.

Then Bitcoinbuilder.com allowed one to buy and sell Goxcoins at a discount.  At one point, you could pay 5% of the value and get a full Goxcoin, which was likely going to be worthless, so it was a risky play.   I like to gamble, so I bought up a bunch of them.  I had about 100 at one time, but then I heard that Gox had zero assets, so I sold most of them (got a little real BTC back out).  The fact that I didn't sell all of them is surprising to me now, but I like to make a low risk/super high reward plays and that was certainly one of them.

Bitcoinbuilder owner said that he would leave the Goxcoin trading open indefinitely, but then he shut it without warning a few weeks later.  So I have funds locked up in there as well.

Soon after that, Karpeles announced that he ""found"" a couple hundred million dollars of BTC in some cold wallet that he had forgotten about.  So that meant that they did have some assets.   

Then there was going to be bankruptcy where you just got a small portion $, based on your BTC that was valued at $400 when it shut down.  However, the price of BTC shot up in 2017 and then last year it was changed to a civil rehabilitation proposal where you get something like 15-20% of the BTC that you had on the exchange.

I am not a holder, and otherwise, I would have sold/hedged what I had on there, so it will be a sizeable lottery win if there is a distribution and I get those funds.  Plus I have even more on Bitcoinbuilder, so if that guy comes through, it will be a double lottery win.  Not life changing money, but living expenses for a few years money.

Of course there's a good chance I will get nothing.  And lately, when I have some of my goxcoins hedged, and BTC goes up in price, I am just losing real money in my Bitmex acct, and that's it.

So that has been the 6 years (and counting) long drama of Mt Gox.  People like to say it turned me off to Bitcoin, but I already came out way ahead with it, and could be a major score, and win, in the end.  T

The later Bitfinex hack and did hurt and that definitely turned me off to the corrupt crypto infrastructure that largely remains to this day. Plus multiple other exchanges stealing my money, etc, etc. You have to be a good enough trader to generate profits that more than make up for all the money that will inevitable be stolen from you.",fs8k1rf,2020-05-30 05:25:09,8

bitusher,"**Review of the ""differences"" with current fiat**

&gt;1) Tokenization

this already exists with regular fiat today from online payment , to apply pay , to samsung pay . Perhaps they mean this new currency will not support what many people use to make payments like traditional credit and debit cards

&gt;2) Third format of currency: A digital dollar will
operate alongside existing fiat currency and
commercial bank money.

This is excellent new for Bitcoin as it means that if the USA adopts this they will downgrade themselves to the likes of a third world country whose local fiat is so poor that they need to barter between USD + their fiat. An extra currency creates more friction and inefficiencies. I doubt this will add friction from bartering different rates as they both  will be pegged but  mainly friction from technical and regulatory differences between the old and new where both will now need to be supported

&gt;Privacy

Nothing in the whitepaper discusses the details. It looks more like a marketing brochure lacking any specifics. I can guarantee it will not be private however.  

&gt;Monetary policy neutral + Maintenance of the two-tiered
banking system


So how is this different than current fiat?

&gt;To verify the transaction, you only need to verify
the authenticity of the bill (the token), and because each bill is unique, it is impossible to spend
the same bill more than once at the same time.

Ok, This is indeed unique and very scary. It means a total lack of privacy because every digital transaction you make  will uniquely identify the source of the digital fiat and history directly to the federal issuer and not a private bank

&gt;might be lower than the costs of hosting a traditional bank account, 

This is highly doubtful 

&gt;The wallet could be readily
registered through a regulated hosting intermediaryb performing requisite Know Your
Customer/Anti-Money Laundering (KYC/AML) checks. 

AML/KYC with per penny tracking of every tx you make from the federal level instead of private banks gathering this info and sometimes sharing it with regulators.

Great news for BTC!

&gt;In a token-based system, the token contains all information necessary for the recipient to verify the
legitimacy of the transaction, and the recipient can verify the object transferred

Well no, that isn't how it will work in practice. Perhaps private banks and certain intermediary will be cut out of authentication but this information will also be shared with the issuer and central bank to allow for censorship and reversibility. There is no way they are creating a digital bearer asset like Bitcoin. 

&gt; distributed ledger technology (DLT)-based or -inspired 

They learned from r3s mistake and not using the term ""blockchain"" with a non proof of work currency. 

&gt; Key to this model is its ability to automate—and
thereby enhance the efficiency of—transactions.

There is no way they are going to be able to remove human auditors and regulators from their Proof of stake coin. No efficiency is going to be found here. 

&gt;Account-based systems rely on authentication to authorize an instruction

So ""state"" or account instead of more efficient UTXO model that Bitcoin has. Basically , what digital fiat already does. 

&gt;...compliance and regulatory processes (e.g.,
AML/KYC) are properly enabled...Fourth Amendment protections 

vague talk of the 4th amendment with no details or proposals 

&gt;A user would have the
ability and choice to hold their digital dollar in
their digital wallets, or deposit it into a bank
account,

this is new. So they are giving fiat owners an opportunity to lose their fiat when they lose their phone and backup like Bitcoin users ? They are undermining one of the few advantages of registered value here. 

&gt;National Security:CBDC should be configured to provide effective infrastructure to support
transactional security standards such as KYC, AML, Anti-Terrorist Financing (ATF), and anti-fraud

More effective means to shutoff funding to journalists , political groups and all sorts of businesses(operation chokepoint)

&gt;Interest-Bearing

like fiat in a savings account?

&gt;Transaction Security: Transaction security across multiple dimensions like KYC,
AML, counterfeit, and fraud must be considered. The maintenance of the US
two-tiered banking system allows existing financial institutions to maintain and
deploy their KYC/AML policies wh

Business as usual than here

&gt;Validation and Governance... model of public-private partnership.

So the fascistic private banking relationship model with the government remains. Understood.

&gt; digital dollar would also enhance payment transparency, thereby supporting the Fed’s
objective to promote safe

The fed isn't willing to be audited so I doubt the transparency will be with politicians and banks who are highly private. The transparency will be with citizens who now lack privacy.

Tricky_Troll,"Today is my 3 year anniversary of owning cryptocurrency! I’d love to share with you all some of the things I have learned in the past few years and some general thoughts. This ended up being longer than I expected so I will break my thoughts down into multiple posts over the next few days.

&amp;#x200B;

* Remember we were all crypto-noobs once. Be kind and helpful to the influx of newcomers who will be asking seemingly dumb questions in the upcoming bull-run.

&amp;#x200B;

Here’s my embarrassing crypto-noob story. I was introduced to Ethereum by a friend I used to game with. He told me he was crypto mining and recommended I should do so too. I had an RX480 in my gaming PC and I had free electricity in my university dorm so I was in the perfect situation to mine. It was literally $5 per day of free money. I quickly realised why mine this stuff while the price is shooting through the roof when I could just buy it?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, so here come the stupid parts. I signed up to a local crypto exchange and I bought 0.1 BTC for a couple hundred dollars. Having seen posts from newly made Ethereum millionaires from r/ETHTrader, I quickly thought 0.1 BTC is never going make me rich. I got full FOMO and sold it for ETH, thinking that 1.5 ETH would be a better bet because at least then I own a whole ETH. I didn’t take into account market cap, circulating supply or any of the important economics behind token valuation. Hell, for 4 months I didn’t really know the difference between a token and a coin, I didn’t know that ETH is called Ether and the network was Ethereum. In my mind I ""owned 1.5 Ethereum”. I kept seeing people in the r/ETHTrader daily complaining about ICOs and whales dumping all the while I was being called a gentleman. \*\*\*I was confused but I was excited for this thing I couldn't understand.\*\*\* For about 4 months I was clueless. I would buy OMG at $6 just because members of the subreddit told me to. I kept my ETH on an exchange and I told all my friends how this thing I couldn’t come close to explaining was the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Slowly but surely, thanks to my excitement, I persisted and learned all the terms, I learned what a smart contract was and why Ethereum is more than just a Bitcoin 2.0 (yes I bought Ether and held it for months before I knew that Ethereum was more than just a currency 🤦‍♂️). I learned how to distinguish a scam from genuine project and I learned how to securely store my crypto. The important thing to note here is that I learned almost all of this from r/ETHTrader and the daily discussion there. Had r/EthFinance been around back then, I’m sure this helpful community would have helped me to understand this space even faster. What I’m saying is that it is important to welcome noobs and their noob questions. It will be frustrating to see new people every day asking “What’s a DeFi?” and “Can someone help me Dai?”. But if were able to persist in learning about the fascinating world of Ethereum ourselves, I’m sure we can persist in helping to educate the newcomers.",fsdio8e,2020-05-31 09:54:08,19

pcvcolin,"This, though everyone's understood this is Democratic policy in a nutshell since 2009-2010, if you weren't already aware of it, it should be obvious now.

Also, just by the way, the S&amp;P 500 has been net increasing since mid February. Exactly what the Free Shit Army will do once most states reopen is beyond me, besides try to get more free TVs.  Or maybe they'll beg Pres. Trump, who they are now trying to overrun by crashing the gates on the White House lawn (that won't end well), that they deserve more endless money printing and free USD dumped in their bank accounts so they can pay for more bus tickets to new locations to burn and pillage?

We saw this in 1992 (in a Maxine Waters ""led"" area in Los Angeles), it is the same thing all over again now, but this time the people looting have a more obviously pro-Democratic slant:  they don't care about solving problems of systemic racism, they just want free shit, and a monopoly on violence (taking away all means of self defense, and only allowing government or a political party the ability to have use of firearms).  The timing is interesting too, just days after many businesses were given relief from the COVID orders, now we see them targeted and burnt to the ground - kind of like that church that recently opened in defiance of a COVID order, and got burned down by an arsonist in response.

The great effort of the Dems now is to decrease the growth of the economy just before the election in hopes that Pres. Trump won't be re-elected. They've pulled everything out of their toolkit: China, Newsom and other governors inclined to shutdown things forever, then when states reopen as they are now, Dems' last gasp and really last weapon in their toolkit is basically the same as what Maxine Waters tried out in LA in 92: encourage looting, call it ""peaceful protest,"" and keep business destruction going as long as possible.

Interestingly though, many market participants appear to interpret this as a more short term impact as you can see from looking at S&amp;P 500 (net increase since mid-February), as well as growing confidence in bitcoin and gold. In other words, ""we've seen it before, we're still investing, not a big thing, moving along.""

Keep stealing TVs, looters. Ought to get you in jail or maybe you can exchange that for several loaves of bread and a few packs of waters. When that's gone, what do you have? A destroyed city - markets continue to grow and rebound - and Pres. Trump is re-elected. Go back to work.

-----

Note:  in full disclosure, I consider myself something of a hybrid of crypto-anarchist and Constitutionalist, because I believe forms of economic interaction (like System D off-the-books participation and counter-economics, which is seen across most of the world, and typical government, which people also commonly participate in) will continue to coexist albeit with obvious tensions.  I personally chose to support Pres. Trump in the last election and see it as logical for 2020 also though I despair of there not being third party inclusion in USA political process.  

People should be defending Constitutional rights for all persons. We don't give them up because of a Seattle mayor or a California governor... or a Minneapolis cop.

**After 3 seconds**, 0-conf transaction is already **final**: assuming miners follow first-seen-first-included rule [which they do on BCH network], you can be almost certain that your transaction is safe and will be included in a block.

3 seconds enough to make shopping experience comparable with credit cards, as BCH network has no downtimes unlike banks.

 So now we have a bunch of layer 2 solutions on ethereum which seem to be working pretty well already(?). Lightning on bitcoin seem very cumbersome compared to these (?).

So is this mostly because:

1.Ethereum is easier to build on?

2.There's a lot more and possibly better development on ethereum?

3.I'm comparing apples and oranges and lightning is more secure or something like that?

If 2, wouldn't this mean that these solutions can be applied to bitcoin too with some tweaking?

Thanks",fsk4gis,2020-06-02 04:49:28,14
DrupeDave,"1 - Ethereum is easier to build on.

It's not that it's easier to build on, it's that it's the only one of your two choices that is possible to build on at any meaningful rate.  Bitcoin was pioneering but Vitalik brought blockchain to the next level by making it general purpose and programmable.

Think of Bitcoin as an arcade machine in the early 90's, people could play cool games on it but if you wanted a new game you had to build a lot of low level hardware / circuits to make the next game. This was just not scaleable from a productivity point of view so people made consoles where you could make a new game just by writing some code and sending it out on a tape / disk to someone. Ethereum is the programmable tape machine, Bitcoin is the arcade machine.

2 -  There's a lot more and possibly better development on ethereum?

Yes, developers imaginations have been sparked by Ethereum and they will build everything you can possibly imagine, just like when the first programmable computer came out everybody built everything they could imagine on it even tho it was a limited machine, people used to build insane programs and even flew people to the moon on them. Etheruem is that machine. It's the Amiga computer of the 90's.

3.I'm comparing apples and oranges and lightning is more secure or something like that?

You are comparing apples and oranges unfortunately, Bitcoin and the lightning network are not very interesting to anyone that knows how to develop and that's a lot of people in todays world. It's kinda like setting a simple simon machine or a scientific calculator down beside a child, sure simple simon and flashing lights (and knows what order transactions were in) are cool but they won't hold attention for long especially once the child realises they can spell BoobLess in numbers on the calculator.

4 -  If 2, wouldn't this mean that these solutions can be applied to bitcoin too with some tweaking?

Nope, this one is a bit technical but it's a UTXO model with no concept of state other than adding transactions inputs and outputs to work out a balance. There is no programmable aspect to it at all, it's pretty much a technical antique. Antiques are cool tho and it will defo still haev value in the future :)",fsk6yp4,2020-06-02 05:09:40,13

BobsBarker12,"Identity Evropa were some of the MAGA hats involved in the Unite the Right nazi rally. They specifically served as a conduit for individual fundraisers for people attending using a right wing fund raising platform called Rootbocks. This was not apparent though immediately as the website they used posed as a neutral ""free speech"" alternative to sites like Patreon.

After the terrorist ramming attack of Heather Heyer by some Trump loving Assad fanboy I kinda lost my nerve and spent a few days detailing the website, it's users and their social media presence. I contacted the domain registrars and hosts they used, their financial presence on Paypal and other ""mainstream"" services. Systematically they were purged from major services and providers.

Their howls of pain on Twitter were delicious, [I archived them](https://web.archive.org/web/20170818023844/https:/twitter.com/RootbocksDotCom). 

After some time they resorted to Bitcoin, this was great since donations were now visible and could be traced. Eventually the admin of the site showed himself to be the founder of Identity Evropa Nathan Damigo.  Nathan, using the fundraising site's Twitter, linked to the P.O. box used by Identity Evropa. [Here is a leaked log from the group with one of them touting P.O. box usage for OPSEC](https://unicornriot.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AmIM_5_15_19_weekly_address.pdf), whoops that didn't work out huh?

There was never any doubt of who was behind the rally, but actually proving it in detail matters. What with people like Trump trying their best to disguise these elements as just random people and not regular attendants of his campaign rallies, like Matthew Heimbach. 

After the site was obliterated they moved onto ""goyfundme"" a short lived replacement with the same shtick but more blatant. Finally they moved to Hatreon, which was publicly organized by Andrew Anglin. These names should ring some bells for those tracking the hilarious merging of 4chan/gamergate/pepe meme/incel/white nationalist/Nazi/Putin fanboy communities into one giant MAGA hat wearing clusterfuck. Remember weev? Remember 'oops didn't mean to be so racist it's just a joke' racist humor being pumped into the right before 2016? 

All that was funded and organized on purpose and current right wing Nazi groups literally marching through the streets are the product of it. OK I'm done ranting now.

edit: While I'm digging through my trash for logs, [here is an archive of the founder's Twitter profile before it's suspension](https://web.archive.org/web/20170222131156/https:/twitter.com/NathanDamigo).

But on a more serious note, you're partially right. Apart from the price being artificially inflated by fake pegged tokens, miners needed to have some backbone at the split - there were multiple miners who just layed down and said 'well I'll keep mining the ticker symbol and hope Core change the code one day'.

I think it largely comes from Chinese miners who are quick to accept authority over them, they're taught not to disagree by the CCP, so they just rolled over when it was obviously time to make a stand.

All I know is that if I'm repeatedly purposefully deceived, lied to, bait and switched, etc etc, then I'd personally take a stand. But I'm not a miner, so I can only stop using/holding Core and remain hopeful that bitcoin can eventually succeed regardless.",fsllesi,2020-06-02 12:44:08,7

1. It never mentions the name of the supposed dead millionaire, even though the letter assures you that you have the same last name. It also doesn't mention which country the millionaire or you reside in, just that you're a citizen of the same country. These specific details are not mentioned because it's a generic scam letter sent to thousands of people in different countries, it's not tailored specifically to you.
2. The letter is basically proposing that you help commit multi-million dollar fraud, so that you won't contact the bank to verify any of this. Also so that when you get scammed out of a couple thousand dollars, you won't try to contact the authorities or dispute the fraud.
3. This is a pretty standard [Advance-Fee Scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). If you actually contacted the email address listed in the letter, you would be asked to provide an up-front payment of a few hundred to a few thousand dollars, telling you that they need that money to prepare the legal documents so that they can get you the millions of dollars. They'll ask you to send the money in some way that is hard to track and impossible to reverse, like a Western Union wire transfer or a Bitcoin payment or something. If you were dumb enough to make that payment, the scammer might try to string you along with a story of how well the deal is progressing, or an unforeseen complication, and ask for further advance fees.

uniVocity,"How decentralized? Check out the node map [here](https://staking.cardano.org/en/shelley-node-map/). Note that this shows the active testnet nodes. Expect the mainnet to be more decentralized than this. Running a node requires some technical skill but not that much. You don't have to commit a single ADA to run one, and you or anyone can start 1000 at any time.

If Charles goes RIGHT NOW the project will have a PR problem, however note that he is not actively developing and researching. That's the job of the PHDs and almost 300 people that work for him. 

The idea is that by the end of the year voting will be working, which will enable the community to vote on who develops what and when.

From an investment standpoint, ADA has a real chance to return you 10x your investment in the short term (one year). A 10x on bitcoin would mean BTC market cap would be almost 2 trillion dollars - which is really really hard as there's nothing in it to attract new money to come in. A 10X on ADA would mean the token reaching $0.80 and becoming the Top 3 crypto currency around. It's not inconceivable after everything is released until the end of the year.

If the community votes to make IELE happen and allow Ethereum smart contracts to be simply copied over to cardano, expect it to overtake ETH and the token price to go over 2 bucks at least (also note it could probably be used to import contracts from other platforms such as tezos). If ADA were to have the same market cap as Bitcoin today, one ADA would be worth 10 dollars. We can't know how much ""new"" money will be attracted into this crypto, but once Hydra is ready (allowing 1M TPS which is more throughput than VISA/Mastercard have) Cardano will be very ready to actually become the ""financial operating system of the world"" and it won't be inconceivable for its market cap to reach 1 trillion dollars (1 ADA = 50 dollars).

Elean0rZ,"The idea originated with proof of work coins (like BTC, LTC, etc.) that are mined. At the start of the chain of blocks (= the blockchain) that is mined, there's a genesis block, which, pretty much by definition, gets mined by the developers of the coin (because they're the only ones that know when they're going to press the 'on' switch, so to speak).

* In a true pre-mine, the developers might have coded things so that that first block just happens to offer a much larger reward than all the subsequent blocks, resulting in a nice little bonus for themselves. 
* There are also 'effective' pre-mines, where a developer might just neglect to tell anyone they're starting the chain, so that they (or their cronies) mine by themselves for a while 'for free' before anyone else starts to compete for blocks. Just like the previous case, this results in an unfair advantage for a small group of people, and also in a poor distribution of tokens in general.
* Things changed when ICOs became common. In that model, proof of work became less popular, and regardless, the ICO model required that many/all of the tokens had to exist in order to be sold in the ICO (as opposed to being mined slowly over time). So, you just code 100 million tokens (or whatever number) into existence, and sell them for $X each, and that's your ICO. This is often also called a 'premine', even though it occurs quite differently vs. old-school premines.

The whole 'scam' thing is often framed in black and white by certain people, especially Bitcoin maximalists, but it really isn't. Basically, premines in the original sense were often associated with scams, because developers would hide the fact that they were doing this, when in fact their plan all along was to pump the price and then dump their premined bags on the market. However, there are also legitimate reasons for premining--for example, the project might premine a certain number of coins to create a development fund that can only be used to advance the project.

Meanwhile, many ICOs were crappy ideas (not actually scams, but a lot of folks here like calling things scams), and some were indeed scams that took the money from the ICO and ran. It's certainly a risky thing for investors, in that you're throwing a bunch of money at an idea with no guarantees. But, again, there is no intrinsic reason why a coin that used an ICO 'premine' model is definitely a scam\*. Some were just 'honestly shitty', if that makes sense--like, the idea just failed or the team made poor decisions with the money or whatever. And there are plenty of totally not-scammy, successful projects that emerged from that model too.

The bottom line is that there's nothing inherently wrong with a premine if it's clearly advertised in advance and investors know what they're getting into. That honesty/transparency piece is pretty much the key here.

\*  We're getting into the weeds a little now, but this issue also gets intertwined in the proof-of-work vs. other consensus mechanisms debate. The argument (oversimplified) is that a blockchain is only as secure, and therefore only as valuable, as the extent and distribution of hashpower on the network. Most ICO projects rely on consensus mechanisms other than PoW, which are much more power efficient, and often more efficient at achieving consensus, but they also tend to be more centralized and don't create the same 'arms race' found in PoW, which (PoW enthusiasts argue) means there isn't the same incentive to protect the network. The argument--again, mostly from PoW enthusiasts which in practice shares a lot of overlap in the Venn diagram with Bitcoin maximalists--is that any project using such a system is selling something intrinsically inferior and less valuable to naive investors, and is thus a scam by definition. They cite as evidence the fact that most coins that ICO'd have since failed or lost value (never mind that the same was true about the huge explosion of non-ICO's PoW coins in 2013/2014).

We're not going to settle that debate here, but suffice to say that it's not that simple. PoW has advantages and disadvantages; non-PoW options have different advantages and disadvantages; and there are various defensible concepts of what a blockchain 'should' be, depending on its intended use and the tradeoffs you are willing to make between speed and decentralization. In practice, what makes a project a scam or not is based on factors unrelated to the consensus mechanism. Correlation doesn't equal causation.

So, TL;DR, many pre-mined coins are crap; some are scams; but being premined doesn't equal 'scam' by definition.",fssgoet,2020-06-04 06:17:37,13

IdrinkandIknwothings,"Le coût de l'immobilier est relié au nombre de gens qui cherchent à acheter, évidemment, le problème c'est qu'une bonne partie de gens qui cherchent à acheter le font pour investir, pas pour habiter dedans.

La raison principale pourquoi l'immobilier part ne fou c'est que c'est à peu près le seul type d'investissement qui est assez gros pour absorber toute l'argent qui se cherche un investissement. Le but c'est de protéger la valeur de l'argent en cas de crise économique et de la mettre à l'abris de l'inflation.

**Quand le pétrole est monté à $150 US le baril**

La fois que le pétrole est parti en fou, ça avait rien à voir avec la demande sur le marché, c'est juste qu'un paquet d'investisseurs ont acheté la ""commodité""... Donc ça avait aucun autre rapport que l'achat de commodité en bourse.

**Le problème de l'investissement**

Si on comptabilise toutes les actions de compagnies disponibles avec toute les commodités (Or, pétrole, cuivre, uranium, blé, bananes) et tous les obligations, le montant de ces chose n'est pas aussi grand que le montant d'argent qui se cherche un investissement.

Ça a résulté dans la surévaluation de compagnies ([La Bulle des .Com](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulle_sp%C3%A9culative_(Internet))), à la surévaluation du pétrole (Baril à $150), à la bulle du Bitcoin et à toute sorte d'augmentation de prix à la consommation.

Mais comme il y a toujours plus d'argent que de choses à acheter, à un moment donné les investisseurs réalisent que le marché est surévalué et ils arrêtent d'acheter... Ce qui fait tomber le prix de ces choses comme durant le crash des .Com (Dot com), le crash du Bitcoin et le crash actuel du pétrole.

C'est la raison pourquoi les investisseurs se tournent vers l'immobilier car, différemment pour le pétrole ou le bitcoin, le marché de l'immobilier est spécial car c'est un produit absolument nécessaire, les gens ont besoin d'un endroit pour vivre et dormir.

**Comment régler le problème?**

Facile, il faut multiplier la construction d'habitation... Sauf que les entrepreneurs ne vont pas construire si'ils ne sont pas certain de pouvoir vendre.

Il faut donc se tourner vers le gouvernement pour qu'il aide les gens à se construire une nouvelle demeure...

**L'autre problème c'est les terrains**

Plus il va y avoir du monde pour bâtir une maison neuve, plus ça va prendre des terrains et plus les terrains vont coûter cher... Ensuite personne ne veut vivre à 2 heures de route du travail ce qui veut dire que certains terrains vont devenir hors de prix... **La solution?** Bâtir en hauteur comme des tours à condos ou à appartement à haute densité.

**Le problème avec la haute densité**

Deux choses: Qualité de vie et les promoteurs ne veulent bâtir que des condos pour riches parce-que c'est plus payant. Il va donc falloir que les gouvernements des villes et le provincial subventionnent ou qu'ils deviennent carrément des promoteurs pour bâtir des logement abordables (on parle pas de logements sociaux) pour les gens de la classe moyenne en prenant soin de mélanger quelques riches, beaucoup de classe moyenne et une quantité moindre de logements sociaux pour bien balancer les choses. Certains pourront être vendus, d'autre mis en location.

**Mais il y a une autre composante**

Pour gérer le prix des terrains, il faut permettre l'étalement urbain, mais l'étalement urbain est mauvais car il occupe des terres agricoles et force les gens à utiliser leur voitures, demandant plus de routes...

La solution c'est un transport en commun rapide, confortable, à passage fréquents et abordable... Le REM, l'extension du métro et l'achat de trains de banlieue plus modernes et plus rapides.

**Donc les prix montent car il y a moins d'habitations que d'acheteurs. L'immobilier est le nouveau refuge des investisseurs. Pour régler le cas il faut bâtir des centaines de milliers de nouvelles demeures mais ça cause l'étalement urbain. Il faut donc augmenter la densité et si les promoteurs ne s'intéressent qu'aux riches acheteurs, il faut que le gouvernement s'en mêle et en même temps, augmenter l'offre de transport en commun efficaces.**",fst7xl8,2020-06-04 10:11:14,12

LargeSnorlax,"This'll sound really dumb:

______________________________________________________________________________________

When I first got into Crypto ""seriously"" was back in April 2017. I bought some Bitcoin, I was mining with 2 antminers for a while.

I got some altcoins with my mined Bitcoin. Now, I had zero idea what I was doing back then, so I put some Bitcoin into some... interesting picks.

One was [Pepecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/memetic/).  (Now called MEME) I also used to do a bunch of trading with the ""Potcoins"", my first alt exchange was Bittrex. 

So, I put a decent chunk of change into Pepecoin at like, $0.02, along with a whole bunch of other weird shit (POT Coin, all those janky things on Bittrex you'd laugh at now). Went back to my Bitcoin mining, started discovering ETH, so on and so forth.


Got into trading BCH for a long time when it started to exist and had these HUGE fluctuations - Discovered Binance and a couple of other alt exchanges up until September, when I remembered I had originally bought some garbage on Bittrex. I wondered if it was worth anything.

Pepecoin was worth like, $0.14. I was amazed, but didn't really want to sell it as I was seeing huge fluctuations in Crypto's price, so I resolved to watch it. One day, it was all the way up to $0.24, which was **ten times** my original price, so I turned it all into BTC and bought some stuff on other exchanges with the profits. 

One of these things was IOTA - Which when I sold Pepecoin, was $0.50.  It looked cool, and while still watching the Crypto markets, got into a bunch of other things. IOTA in the madness period went up to **$5.00**. So, in keeping with my original plan, I sold half of my IOTA in the beginning of December and looked into other things. Some of that became LINK, some became XRB, some became BNB.

**However**:

Some of that also became utter trash that was pure speculation.  Stuff like [Publica](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/publica/) which no longer exists, or [RVR](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/revolutionvr/) which used to be VOX - Some of those ""investments"" are just $0 sums now.



______________________________________________________________________________________

So, Crypto is a funny place. As long as you treat it as entirely speculative, and understand your money can either explode or disappear, you should be fine.

But if I look back, a lot of the fun I had in Crypto was betting on totally unknown horses - I'd say the vast majority of the original gains I had was from trading a fucking meme coin into random other things and getting lucky on some others afterwards. :)",fsw84jc,2020-06-05 04:49:39,7

Just look at the US fed printer going brrrr.  Nano has no miners dumping their coins to pay for operational costs.  If you ask anyone who knows anything what the best purely transactional coin is, they will say Nano.  It’s not even a debate because you can’t beat instant and free.  People also underestimate the different between a very small fee, like .01 cents, and free.  It is a world of a difference.  

Nano’s community is VERY strong and it’s thriving.  

Nano is the least scammy coin out of them all, including bitcoin.  It was distributed via free faucet, is decentralized, and is transparent.  

Nano’s dev team and it’s founder are first class geniuses.

__heimdall,"Well I was curious.  I haven't kept up with changes in real time over the last 5 years, and as a dev I figured I might as well dig through their change log and see what bubbles up.

I see 29 released going back 5 years, starting with 0.11.0 on July 12, 2015.  My notes from reviewing all the changes:

\- There's honestly a worrying series of versions (especially recently) that add then later remove features, APIs, parameters, etc.  Though I'm only going off changelogs and don't have  full details, it reads like the devs are shooting from the hip and aren't thinking far enough ahead.

\- BIP 174 added partially signed bitcoin transactions (PSBT) in version 0.17.0.  I'd count that as a big improvement, very much needed for security enhancements on hardware wallets

\- BIP 173 added full segwit support in 0.16.0 (after the softfork in 0.13.1).  Contentious feature for sure, but it is a big feature none the less.  Questionable for a scaling solution long term, but BCH does have basically the same feature

\-  BIP 32 added Hierarchical Deterministic wallets - another one that's really beneficial for security and privacy, especially combined with PSBT and hardware wallets

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure there's some I missed, but it was a bit disappointing to not find more!  There's plenty of bug fixes, security patches, etc. but over the scale of 5 years, or roughly half of bitcoin's existence, that's a bit disappointing to see for sure",ft3t06k,2020-06-06 20:28:28,8
Happy_Pizza_,"So, a long time ago, in 2018, [I made a prediction that bitcoin would break down from the 6k meme](https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/9ix8ct/prediction_bitcoin_will_break_its_long_term/) triangle.  The logic behind that (correct) prediction, was that bitcoin was unlikely to rise as fast as the long term trendline was predicting, therefore we would break down from the descending triangle.

What if we use that logic for today's situation?

Weekly chart:  https://www.tradingview.com/x/mp8jjqtC/

Daily chart:  https://www.tradingview.com/x/77ZBLMSf/

As you can see, we are currently at a **very** pivotal point.  The current uptrend we are in is bumping up against the macro descending trendline.  We either break down from our current uptrend or we break up in a big way.  

We should also note how steep the uptrend is.  If we continue the current rate of growth, we'll see 15k by end of 3rd quarter and **at minimum** breach our all time high by December.

So, does that mean our current uptrend is unsustainable?  Well..... I'm not so sure.  We shouldn't be intimated by the steepness of the slope on the weekly chart.  The previous expansions also had extremely steep growth rates relative to what came before them (EDIT: I didn't use lograthimic numbers for those charts.  That was a mistake.).  The growth rate implied by our current trend could still be unsustainable but the fundmentals for a massive run are here unlike in 2018.

This isn't a prediction post.  I'm not sure if we're going to break up or down and I don't think anyone else knows either.  

The more interesting observation is that this is a really big test for [Plan B's Stock to Flow model](https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor).  His model predicts an end of year price of 30k **which is actually in line with our current trendline holding.**  So if our current trendline holds, that would provide some early validation for his model and vice versa if it breaks down.

The two trends intersect around June 16th.  In a week and a half, we'll know.",ft3whe3,2020-06-06 20:53:16,10
NilacTheGrim,"Yeah their disregard for performance is stunning.  Here are two gems I came across recently:

- This adds 10ms latency to the background task scheduler every minute,  spinning the CPU uselessly in a busy loop for 10ms every minute.  There are better ways to strengthen the entropy pool than this garbage: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15224 . This 10ms busy loop is claimed to be harmless by sipa, but he's wrong.  The scheduler is used everywhere and this commit affects mining, potentially adding 10ms lag to block validation when mining.

- This one throws away slightly faster usage in favor of doing the absolutely dumb thing: double-copying a potentially large data structure (a tx).  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14588/files#diff-01aa7d1d32f1b9e5a836c9c411978918R1558.

A good comparison for Bitcoin's monetary policy is the the US Constitution. It's supposed to be difficult to change. Imagine criticizing the constitution by saying, ""It's only been amended 33 times since 1789!""

By having a stable and consistent monetary policy, we can imagine exactly what Bitcoin will look like decades into the future. Coins that radically change their code ever couple years are unpredictable... and unpredictable is the last thing you want from a currency or a monetary policy.

Value-form,"&gt; The Zbellion plot was a small part of JLASS 2018, which also featured scenarios involving Islamist militants in Africa, anti-capitalist extremists, and ISIS successors. The war game was conducted by students and faculty from the U.S. military’s war colleges, the training grounds for prospective generals and admirals. While it is explicitly not a national intelligence estimate, the war game, which covers the future through early 2028, is “intended to reflect a plausible depiction of major trends and influences in the world regions,” according to the more than 200 pages of documents.

&gt; According to the scenario, many members of Gen Z — psychologically scarred in their youth by 9/11 and the Great Recession, crushed by college debt, and disenchanted with their employment options — have given up on their hopes for a good life and believe the system is rigged against them. Here’s how the origins of the uprising are described:

&gt; Both the September 11 terrorist attacks and the Great Recession greatly influenced the attitudes of this generation in the United states, and resulted in a feeling of unsettlement and insecurity among Gen Z. Although Millennials experienced these events during their coming of age, Gen Z lived through them as part of their childhood, affecting their realism and world view … many found themselves stuck with excessive college debt when they discovered employment options did not meet their expectations. Gen Z are often described as seeking independence and opportunity but are also among the least likely to believe there is such a thing as the “American Dream,” and that the “system is rigged” against them. Frequently seeing themselves as agents for social change, they crave fulfillment and excitement in their job to help “move the world forward.” Despite the technological proficiency they possess, Gen Z actually prefer person-to-person contact as opposed to online interaction. They describe themselves as being involved in their virtual and physical communities, and as having rejected excessive consumerism.

&gt; In early 2025, a cadre of these disaffected Zoomers launch a protest movement. Beginning in “parks, rallies, protests, and coffee shops” — first in Seattle; then New York City; Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles; Las Vegas; and Austin — a group known as Zbellion begins a “global cyber campaign to expose injustice and corruption and to support causes it deem[s] beneficial.”

&gt; During face-to-face recruitment, would-be members of Zbellion are given instructions for going to sites on the dark web that allow them to access sophisticated malware to siphon funds from corporations, financial institutions, and nonprofits that support “the establishment.” The gains are then converted to Bitcoin and distributed to “worthy recipients” including fellow Zbellion members who claim financial need. Zbellion leadership, says the scenario, assures its members that their Robin Hood-esque wealth redistribution is not only untraceable by law enforcement but “ultimately justifiable,” as targets are selected based on “secure polling” of “network delegates.” Although its origins are American, by the latter 2020s, Zbellion activities are also occurring across Europe and cities throughout Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, including Nairobi, Kenya; Hanoi, Vietnam; and Amman, Jordan.

Edit : Did a little digging. This is where it started :

#### 1. https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/9302 : **Brave suggested sites for crypto wallets #9302**

CTO of brave commented : 
&gt; Similar to top site suggestions, we'd like to add Crypto Widgets and Binance related suggestions based on what a user types in the URL bar. This is mostly an experiment to see if it's useful. It could be expanded in the future to involve BAT or even be used if the user has Brave ads turned on.

Then they tested, verified and added that in.


#### 2. https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/9782 : **Add top site and brave suggested site suggestion settings on Android #9782**

&gt; It is needed for 1.9.x, Basically there are some new suggestions that we populate for brave suggested sites like ""Bitcoin"" to give a link to buy bitcoin on Binance with a referral code.

This is where it was added to Android.


#### 3. https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/5567 : **Added new autocomplete options to privacy settings #5567**

This is where the toggle was added to settings. Note that it was left enabled by default.

Honestly it is way more likely that we would not give a damn about school at all, I would be super bored in school, not having any friends since they are all dumb 12 year olds, my grades would be good for a couple of years without me even trying, I would not care about anything other than trying to make money. Work as much part time as possible to save as much money as possible so I can invest in the right things, like apple stocks or even wait until bitcoin is introduced and invest in that, I would probably try to convince my father that Im actually a 35year old in the body of a 12 year old, but I need to be smart about it so that he doesn't think Im insane. But if I can convince him my knowledge could make our family very wealthy. So normal education will be a waste of time. But what do I do to not go insane in my spare time?

stinkbutt55555,"Fixed it:

""The major issue here is high risk speculation. The internet is full of people who talk up the value of a company to raise its price and then sell to reap profit before others. If you haven’t bought stock in a company early before it has risen significantly in value (through careful research) it is almost not worth investing in a stock that is running up like crazy.

You might get lucky and see your money swell, but the more it gets into overbought territory the bigger the chances profit takers take money off the table. 

Other things to consider are that a company like genius with no healthy revenue - their only way of funding themselves is via methods that decrease the value of existing shares. This includes: dilution, secondary offerings, warrants, shelf offerings, Gypsy swaps.

This has bitcoin written all over it. 20 people make a ton of money, 200 people lose it. Don’t buy a stock because someone inflated its value. At least pull up the financials and pretend to read it or go to a reputable financial information site and look up things like filings, insiders, institutional ownership etc.""",ft9nzui,2020-06-07 22:55:34,21

nullc,"Liquid isn't particularly censorship resistant. If someone tells you it is they're confused.

Back when I worked at blockstream there was thought in the design to mitigate some of the risks: make transactions difficult to identify, even the peg outs use a ring signature to authorize them, and blockstream should have no ability to change the software in use (instead, they'd have to convince each of the functionaries to run replacement software if they wanted it deployed-- and the software is open source). At some point engineering made a tool that would analyze a proposed membership and work out the implications of geopolitical correlated failures. The system was designed to hide the operating locations from the functionaries from each other. But like other multiparty system's its still centralized even though the centralization is distributed, so countermeasures can only go so far.  The reason it has them is because the centralization makes them all the more important, but it doesn't make it non-centeralized.  [To be clear, I have absolutely no operating knowledge about Liquid-- I left blockstream before it was in production and things could have changed after I left.]

For Bitcoin liquid is an alternative to straight up exchange custody and has some potentially useful security trade-offs compared to that.  But if you wouldn't leave bitcoins with an exchange then they probably shouldn't be in liquid either, because even though there are probably countermeasures it's probably impossible for any of us to validate that they're actually in place and working or reason about their implications.

One of the things that frustrates me about this space though is that some of the same people who go on about liquid not being censorship resistant are happy to promote extremely centralized altcoins or single point exchanges which are no better.",ftcllcm,2020-06-08 16:50:48,11

NateNate60,"Granted.

The United Nations adopts Security Council Resolution No. 86-1949, establishing a new regulatory body with absolute authority over the Internet, known simply as the Internet Authority. The IA has the authority to order the deletion or censorship of any content on the Internet, using vast server farms and computer botnets located in six continents to knock non-compliant websites offline. Anyone under the age of 18 may submit a Purge Request to the IA to have any pictures of or references to them permanently removed from the Internet.

For the first few years, the IA works tirelessly to fight cybercrime, terrorism, and human trafficking by scouring the Internet for evidence and serving hundreds of digital search warrants a month from its office in the Hague.

Eventually, they are frustrated with how encryption is hindering their efforts and keeping their targets' communications secret. The IA issues an order for all encryption to include a backdoor that IA investigators can access to read the encrypted information. Politicians across the world praise this as a great step towards ensuring public security.

Despite this, people are still building their own encryption programs that ignore IA rules and ensure perfect privacy in communications. The IA responds by setting up firewall servers in every country to filter out and block all encrypted data that's not compliant with IA rules. Countries that don't cooperate are disconnected from the global Internet.

To combat money laundering, all cryptocurrencies are now hereby prohibited and their packets will be filtered. Without a reliable way to broadcast blocks and transactions, the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains grind to a halt, slowly being abandoned, much to the detriment of Internet libertarians everywhere.

In addition, on the request of several undisclosed heads of government, any communication that threatens the national security of a state will be filtered out and blocked. Any government may simply submit a Request to Suppress to the IA to block any information they deem to be detrimental to state security. Within weeks, the websites of several prominent Russian opposition political groups all mysteriously go offline.

The Government of China, seeing a tremendous opportunity, uses this as a chance to further tighten their grip over the flow of information. The websites of pan-democratic political parties in Hong Kong are taken offline, as is the entire Taiwanese Government's computer system, as fhs UN recognises the Peoples' Republic of China as the legitimate government of all of China, including Taiwan. With government programs all being reset to 70s technology in Taiwan, internal unrest ensues and the island's government quickly implodes, allowing Beijing to realise their 100 year-long dream of reunifying China. 

Without any voice in traditional media not any way to connect with voters, the pan-democrats in Hong Kong lose almost all their seats in the legislature, and the new strongly pro-Beijing majority immediately proposes dissolving the devolved Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in favour of letting the central Chinese government directly administer the city ""for efficiency's sake"".

In the United States, the NSA secret submits Orders to Suppress against several news agencies because fake news is harmful to national security and public discourse. The IA honours these requests, declaring that it is not their place to interpret the US Constitution. Now, only Government-approved news agencies will be able to stay online.

Several large tech companies manage to avoid this fate through multi-million dollar campaign donations.

Also for some insight into why I think Bitcoin is useful - 

1) **Save money** -  I like to save money with various services like lolli.com, ln.pizza ,foldapp.com,purse.io, or bitrefill.com

2) **Digital Gold** - Bitcoin is very desirable and scarce and since it is an uncorrelated asset class your portfolio is better hedged to be a safer way of finding alpha

3) **Timestamping** - Tweetstamp, and opentimestamps are useful timestamping tools 

4) **Insurance** - If my bank account or credit cards get lost or stolen or account is frozen Bitcoin is a great alternative to store value

5) **Censorship Resistance**- I can make donations to organizations like defense distributed or wikileaks even if their payment processors and banks are shutoff due to unethical political pressure

6) **Soverignty** - As a Business I can accept value even if I am deplatformed or banned from banking 

7) **Micro txs** microtxs are simply not possible with fiat , where I  can do so with my BTC lightning wallet

8) **Security** SSS and multisig with CLTV and other scripts allow for novel methods to secure ones wealth

9) **Privacy** with electronic fiat I have no privacy unlike with Bitcoin transactions where I am given a choice between privacy or transparency with each wallet

11)	**Global** I can travel the world , rent hotels and buy plane tickets and withdraw local currency easily without fears of credit card fraud. I can send payments to employees in foreign countries easily

11) **Interesting and fun** It is fascinating mixture of technology, game theory, security, mathematics, politics, and economics that never bores me


If you want an investment viewpoint of Bitcoin - 

I believe Bitcoin is going to be over 1 million USD per BTC in value in the future. When this will occur , I have no idea.  Around 2-4 million BTC have been permanently lost or burnt. This means that you have around 14 million to 16 million BTC will be fought over in the next few years , but many Bitcoin users are long term hodlers so at least half of those BTC are trapped in their savings. Thus you have a situation where 7-8 million BTC could potentially be purchased with ~2100 Billionaires in the world and at least ~36 million millionaires. If even a small percentage of these wealthy investors wanted to hedge 1-5% of their portfolio in Bitcoin they couldn't without dramatically increasing the value of Bitcoin. These days it is actually dangerous not to have at least 5% exposure to Bitcoin because it is an uncorrelated asset class and one needs a balanced portfolio. This is how scarce Bitcoin is. 
 
 
I have no plans on taking any profits(I am just going to spend and replace while keep increasing my BTC savings every year) for at least 8 years due to this. -
 
Why?
 
There is a generational change occurring with not only investing but preference in banking and currency usage. 
 
millennial's and Generation Z grew up in the digital world and have little interest in investing in gold or silver and don't trust banks. People investing in gold and silver(or gold mining companies) I meet are typically in their late 40s or older. What is interesting about this shift is the key aspect of gold that these older gold bugs appreciate about their investment , being tangible and physical commodity that can be used and held physically , is the same thing that these 2 last generations reject and see as a burden or something that takes up space or inconvenient to store or secure.
 
Generation Y or Millennial's (born ~1982 to 2002) are now 37 to 17 and will begin to replace generation X as the new group with the greatest investing and spending capital (ages 45-54). This means in as little as 8 years you are going to start to see the transition of millennial into peak spending/investing ages and start to push out gen X who is more ambivalent/mixed to digital era. Baby boomers will be well into retirement and not be investing/spending and more living off their IRAs and pensions and their lack of familiarity and confidence of cryptocurrency will have little consequence. Thus in 8 years you will have gen Y enter their peak spending and investing and gen Z fill the next greatest category of spenders/investors(early career).
 
The other key takeaway is that these age groups also shift from not only spending more but investing more which is critical. Let’s look at the breakdown averages in the USA-
 
1) Less than 25 Years Old – $31,102 in spending (94.6%% of total income)
 
2) Between 25-34 Years – $48,928 in spending (**70.8%** of total income)
 
3) Between 45-54 Years – $64,781 in spending (**64.6%** of total income)
 
4) Over 75 Years Old – $40,211 in spending (95.6% of total income)

These numbers represent spending and investing habits of different age demographics in the USA from the Bureau of Labor Statistics

https://www.visualcapitalist.com/how-americans-make-and-spend-their-money-by-age-group/


 
Notice from 25 to 54 these individuals have the most money not only to spend but also to invest. Baby boomers retiring are spending almost all their income surviving (healthcare) and/or vacationing and no longer investing as much. Once gen Y and gen Z dominate these 2 age brackets than a heavy bias towards Bitcoin will occur.
 
Another issue is people and countries will start to transition away from gold in the future as a hedge 
 
In 2026 Psyche will start reporting back to NASA the expected reality that there will a sudden hyper-inflationary spike in the volume of gold being mined in the near future
https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/psyche/
Since psyche 16 asteroid represents an example of an asteroid that is a core of an early planet thus metallic and estimated to contain around $700 quintillion dollars of precious metals (gold, platinum, etc..) or 93 billion dollars of precious metals per person.
While mining will not start immediately, the markets will start pricing in the expectation of mining and nation states will start to slowly sell their gold reserves if they are wise enough flooding the market with cheap gold.
Nation states will need an alternative asset to hedge against.

Fundamentals are going to prove they are solid and crypto market is stabilizing until next bull run. 

I’m staking ADA from November 2019 and I will keep on until 2030 or more if everything go well. 

About prices, i believe BTC will reach previous ATH in the next 6 to 12 months and trigger a massive alt season. At this point I believe ADA will also come back to previous ATH or more and then enter a multi month consolidation. My prediction is that the next Bitcoin super cycle is going to last until 2023 where we will witness 6 digit BTC and ADA may reach 2 digit right before a huge crash and then a similar 2018’s market purge. So I believe we will see 2 maybe 3 major price swings for Cardano until the next major bear market in 3/4 years.

I've spent countless hours looking for and assessing alternatives/competitors to what the Ethereum community is achieving. There simply isn't anything like it out there.


The first thing I look for in any whitepaper is how it differentiates itself from what Ethereum is doing. If it ignores Ethereum it's safe to say it's a scam. Ethereum isn't the first to showcase blockchain technology. It's currently still in the shadow of Bitcoin which was the first blockchain technology. It's only a matter of time before enough people realize the use of Ethereum vs Bitcoin. 

I would without a shred of doubt bet my life on what the prevailing blockchain technology will be in 50 years from now. It will not be bitcoin.

yazmataz_,"Starting to think, did vechain need to wait to break long term VET/BTC MA’s in order to finally get where it should be in relation to other tokens/coins with its market cap?

It feels like it’s been suppressed strictly because of MA’s.. now that it has broken through some critical ones, it seems like it will rise to where it should be. 

I think the only logical price comparison you can do in the world of crypto is compare projects to each other. If we do that, there is no way that vet should be worth less than tron, cardano, Leo, ethereum classic, and tezos, at the very least. 

There’s an argument for top 10 based on transactions, especially with growth of partnerships, and expected growth rate of tx’s. I’ll leave this as a reference — [coinstats](https://coinstats.network) . I think if vet continues at the rate it is, especially with upcoming projects going live, it may climb this list of tx’s to around Binance/bitcoin level. If that’s the case, I can’t really see why it would be outside the top 10, especially with the rally behind it.

AJ-Smiles,"Hey man, few thoughts from someone who knows his IT pretty well..  
  
The article says there is a 'server' farm in the basement and attaches a photo. I am pretty certain it is actually a bitcoin/cryto-coin farm:  
  
https://scontent-lht6-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/fr/cp0/e15/q65/15675674_583537358503424_902927555886293395_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&amp;_nc_sid=dd9801&amp;_nc_ohc=JJrZphG3rOoAX_KvQ1F&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-lht6-1.xx&amp;_nc_tp=14&amp;oh=db79af6b6a60a7dd1c4c5dd3f65f0a92&amp;oe=5F04CA90  
  
All those racks are graphics cards. Notice the giant fans against the racks in the back room in the photo in the article, cryto mining farms require a ton of airflow because the gfx cards are essentially running at 100% 24/7, getting ridiculously hot and would literally melt the boards if there was no cooling.    
  
Take a look also at the fake roof where they apparently found 'the evidence'. Those components are clearly routers and USB hubs. Not hard drives. If they were running a server farm there would be a LOT more ethernet cables.

This is an incredibly messy server rack, but you get the idea.  
  
I think you might be on to something with the connection to the German Maddy guy though, and now apparently the prosecutor has evidence that proves she's dead, but not one single reason why they think that, or even a clue to where a body would be.  
  
I think she is alive, these stories are seeds for what's to come, plant seeds in people's head that she is dead but never actually confirm it with any evidence. In about a month or 2, when it has been cemented as fact in the minds of the masses that she's dead, and when the masses need to be distracted from some other shady bullshit, she will return. It will blow people's minds.  
  
She will be a teenager and she will be the biggest celebrity in the world for a while, interviews left right and center, constantly on TV, a best selling book will come out, probably a film too, everyone's attention and focus will be on her, while some other shady bullshit is going on elsewhere in the world.",ftfcxcy,2020-06-09 09:26:30,19

When Bitcoin started to go crazy, the conversation became solely about meme's, Lamborghini's, and the price going to the moon.

decibels42,"10k *is* unlikely, as you say. I don’t think most of the jokes about it, and more serious discussion about it, are betting on us definitely seeing 10k. 

BUT, with that said, 10k is still a possibility, both from the POV of irrationality during a bull + what we know about where this tech is (and is going) fundamentally. What exactly that possibility is, no one really knows. It’ll hit that, if ever, based on too many factors to know, quantify, and weigh right now.

I think the talk stems from things like 10k (a 1T market cap) not being *that* crazy of a valuation when compared to other multi-trillion dollar asset classes like metals, real estate, bonds, derivatives, etc. (and when considering how influential and useful Ethereum can be)—heck even some individual stocks have gotten to the elusive 1T market cap, and stocks just give you a dividend, at best (the equivalent of ETH staking rewards), while ETH has oh so much more utility.

Will it be justified during the next bull? Maybe not, but that doesn’t mean speculation can’t take us there once we start moving (look at Tesla—twice this year—and so many other examples including Bitcoin from 2014-5 to 2017). Even if we don’t hit 10k during the next bull (if and when it comes), it still could get hit during a future cycle—we are still very very early in all of this.",ftlmsoc,2020-06-11 01:54:04,12

decibels42,"My counter to this is that if you think eth2 will arrive over the next 1-3 years, now is the absolute best time to bet on it.

Imo, ETH enters the SOV market/narrative once eth2 arrives, which will have about a 0.5% issuance rate + gas fee burning + a 5% return/bond-like function (for conservative returns if you participate as a staker; though in the beginning this can be closer to 20%). 

If BTC does succeed with its SOV narrative pitch (it’s only remaining use case), it will have 100% of that market share. With eth2, Ethereum will begin to attract some of the people who own crypto for the SOV purpose. After factoring in ETHs more diverse and versatile use cases (that create real demand for ETH and act as insurance for ETHs SOV argument), it’s pretty fair to say that ETH will have a strong narrative for taking at least some of BTCs SOV market share.

Looking at the hard numbers, Bitcoin’s issuance is 2% today, 1% in 2024, 0.5% in 2028, while Ethereum’s will drop from 4% today to 0.5% as soon as 2021, and could be potentially negative when gas fees are burned. This would ensure ETHs issuance to be less than Bitcoin’s for at least two halvings (potentially until 2032), and the security mechanism to ensure the chain is based on a model that’s more sustainable (POS as opposed to Bitcoin which relies on decreasing block rewards/increasing fees).",ftmaq7p,2020-06-11 04:58:11,14

yeahdave4,"The same thing that happened just before the last run to $1400 is about to start.  It is an essential and critical indicator:  The complaining.  

Here's a relatively shallow post meant to illustrate a point:

.




**Background:**

Eth is doing what it did last run: the price is starting to lag and become even more absurdly detached from underlying fundamentals (the impatient 
 will call it ""under performing"").  It is stuck waiting for BTC while ""everything else goes up"".  There is no fundamental reason for Eth to stick around under 250.  Everything else with far less potential and fundamental value is in ""risk on"" mode.  I anticipate the complaining will start soon.

**Data:**

Let's use some examples from the current flavors of the month to illustrate this gap.

From the Black Thursday low (lets say $100), Eth has gone up 250% (lets say its $250 right now).

However if Eth kept up with:

Kyber it would be $314

Nano it would be $353

Cardano it would be $354

Vechain it would be $423 

That's a pretty big difference.

**Conclusion:**

Either:

Eth sucks and ""those lazy devs keep delaying making me rich"" and ""waa where my moon"" 


or 

Eth hasn't even **remotely** begun to move.  

Choose now and plan accordingly because I promise you this lag will happen again (is already happening).  Choose which project has more potential, provides more value to the human race, and is more likely to exist years from now (or you know... diversify).  



Oh and don't give me that ""but look at the market cap"" nonsense.  We all know that's a pretty meaningless metric when XRP, Bitcoin cash, Bitcoin SV, and EOS are ""the top 10"".

Pentagon Documents Reveal The U.S. Has Planned For A Bitcoin Rebellion

BILLY BAMBROUGH JUNE 11, 2020

Bitcoin has struggled to find support in the U.S. government, with president Donald Trump, along with Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, leading the criticism.

Now, it's been revealed the U.S. Department of Defense has wargamed scenarios involving a Generation Z rebellion that uses bitcoin to undermine and evade ""the establishment.""

In the Pentagon war game, young people born between the mid-1990s and early 2010s use cyber attacks to steal money and convert it to bitcoin, documents published by investigative news site The Intercept revealed.

Called the 2018 Joint Land, Air and Sea Strategic Special Program (JLASS), the war game is set in 2025 and is ""intended to reflect a plausible depiction of major trends and influences in the world regions.""

The scenario, which echoes recent protests in the U.S. and around the world against racial injustice, involves some members of Gen Z, who see themselves ""as agents for social change"" and believe the ""system is rigged"" against them, begin a ""global cyber campaign to expose injustice and corruption and to support causes it deem[s] beneficial.""

The group, called Zbellion, encourages cyber attacks against organizations that support ""the establishment,"" funnelling stolen cash into bitcoin to make ""small, below the threshold donations"" to ""worthy recipients"" and Zbellion members.

The program, which also reportedly wargamed scenarios involving Islamist militants and anti-capitalist extremists, was conducted by students and faculty from the U.S. military’s war colleges, the training ground for prospective generals and admirals.

Bitcoin has increasingly been adopted by Wall Street and the world's biggest financial institutions since its 2017 price explosion but remains a tool to fight government control.

The Pentagon war game documents have been revealed after Florida Republican Representative Matt Gaetz called for the government to ""freeze"" the money of demonstrators after country-wide protests over the killing of George Floyd turned violent this month.

""One of the most important tools in the authoritarian toolkit is the ability to freeze the funding of legitimate political dissent,"" Nathaniel Whittemore, a bitcoin and cryptocurrency consultant and strategist, said previously.

""By separating the infrastructure of money from the infrastructure of state power, bitcoin makes it that much harder for this type of politically motivated confiscation.""

Bitcoin has seen a surge of interest in recent months due to the coronavirus pandemic and never-before-seen levels of government borrowing.

""In the wake of unprecedented central bank action around the Covid-19 crisis, it seemed like the most relevant narrative of bitcoin in 2020 was as a hedge against inflation,"" Whittemore said.

""It appears, however, that its capacity for censorship resistance might be just as relevant.""",ftpyljh,2020-06-12 03:21:48,7

* Has a pretty good and easy to read [privacy committment](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/privacy/public-dns-resolver/)
* Offer encrypted dns (both DoT and DoH)
* Have no capacity issues for an upstream project making it default

By comparison, the alternatives listed in OP's post:

* dns.watch
 * No formal privacy policy that I saw. Doesn't look like they do any moetization at least.
 * though they do keep anonymized data, just like cloudflare (interestingly, that is in smaller text footnote)
 * One of their selling features is that they're small enough to go un-noticed and unfiltered. I'm sure making that the global fallback for all systemd-using distros will keep them unnoticed...
 * They appear to exist in one datacentre in Germany, unless I misread their page.
 * Their [sponsors page](https://dns.watch/sponsors) is very empty. The only way to contibute is via bitcoin...

* adguard (unfiltered dns)
 * Their DNS FAQ answer to privacy mentions Encryption.. Uh...
 * Their [Main Privacy Policy](https://adguard.com/en/privacy.html) prohibits their services to be used by people under 16. Will need to add a new field to /etc/passwd...
 * Not sure how much of that the privacy policy applies to DNS, but it does mention they do collect personal data, and you can download it. Likely more related to their apps, but that's still their overall privacy policy.
 * Their [DNS Privacy Notice](https://adguard.com/en/privacy/dns.html) indicates they keep anonyimized data.

Now personally I'm not using Google. I also didn't bother to look up their policies (I really don't care).

That said, both Google and Cloudflare are big, their DNS infrastructure is resilient and unlikely to have problems. It's perfectly reasonable to have them as defaults and leave it up to distros to fuck it up if they want.

In those systems, transactions are confirmed by a large number of other users who must stake coins of their own. They can't create fake transactions, and having to stake their own coins means if they try to censor other people's transactions the network gets a bad reputation and so goes down in price - meaning their stake they had to put up goes down in value too.

There are a *lot* of cryptocurrencies out there competing, trying to become a 'standard' or just widely used for different use cases. I like crypto and think it's cool to watch it develop.

* Many altcoins since 2018 were just smashed like they worth nothing, now some are now dirty cheap and raise the appetite of cash owners. 
* The expectation that they may go even lower start to feed away and fast. 
* The inevitable shortage in Bitcoin due to the halving is yet another strong sign that the market may explode in the coming months. 
* The current covid crisis put under pressure fiat like never before and some country are already leaving the post-fiat era. 
* The coin itself is among the super-fast coins in the market with privacy and other nice gadgets

**Watch you see is watch you get**

The bracelet currently fits ~7 inch wrist (plus another inch or so with divers extension deployed). There is an additional link, but it is missing the pin and the little round gold piece that goes in the middle. Also one of the link pins is split in two pieces, but since they are strong friction tube fitted pins, it seems to be holding fine, just mentioned it for full disclosure. 

**Asking price is ~~$275 reduced $195~~ $190 OBO** Shipped to CONUS (I do ship internationally contact me for shipping quotes). 
I'm pretty motivated to move this piece so bring on your offers or trades. 
Payment via PayPal (+3%), Zelle, Cash app, bitcoin.

I didn't say that. Do you even understand context? You're the one suggesting not to spend it (at least, not for a long time). Not that it would happen, but if everyone did as you say, the market would be dead; no selling means no buying. There has to be some trading. And IMO there should also be some spending; otherwise, it's not the currency it's supposed to be.",fupqp30,2020-06-14 01:32:47,1

The hardware wallet doesn't even really change anything, it just adds one more step of verification before coins can be sent from your wallets.

Sinity,"&gt; I don't think you can solve a political and social problem like this with technology, unless it's some indistinguishable-from-magic levels of overpowered.

Scott has a great blogpost aligned with my position on this; it probably argues for it better than I could: https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/10/society-is-fixed-biology-is-mutable/

&gt; See, my terrible lecture on ADHD suggested several reasons for the increasing prevalence of the disease. Of these I remember two: the spiritual desert of modern adolescence, and insufficient iron in the diet. And I remember thinking “Man, I hope it’s the iron one, because that seems a lot easier to fix.”

&gt; Society is really hard to change. We figured drug use was “just” a social problem, and it’s obvious how to solve social problems, so we gave kids nice little lessons in school about how you should Just Say No. There were advertisements in sports and video games about how Winners Don’t Do Drugs. And just in case that didn’t work, the cherry on the social engineering sundae was putting all the drug users in jail, where they would have a lot of time to think about what they’d done and be so moved by the prospect of further punishment that they would come clean.

&gt; And that is why, even to this day, nobody uses drugs.

----

&gt; Even assuming you somehow manage to interest a significant enough percent of the population in using decentralised and encrypted networks, all it would take from the government is to ban it and assign heavy enough penalties for violation

All it takes is users *ignoring the ban*. ""Looking"" at the government like it's grown a second head. I mean, if US government outlawed
*the Internet*, people wouldn't do anything.

And government won't straight-up ban it. They didn't even ban *Tor* yet, and there's Drug Markets &amp; CP &amp; stolen data just *lying there*. They didn't ban Bitcoin - and there's even an excuse for doing that (other than making a competing currency which is illegal): there's CP encoded in the blockchain apparently. Which simply can't be deleted without ""deleting"" whatever-current-market-cap-of-BTC-is of value.

&gt; And AFAIK, contents and destination of an encrypted protocol traffic may stay hidden, but the traffic itself is easily visible to the provider.

Yes, but then you have ways around this. Nothing *impossible* to break. There's some dependence on geopolitics I think. But basically, Russia/China doesn't like US. Will they turn in traffic logs from the server in their territory? I doubt. So, use a VPN located in Russia.

All the government can see is that you communicate with a server in Russia.

You could do multiple steps even. Pay for VPN with bitcoin, which you buy locally. Have a VPN service in Russia, and in China, and in Switzerland, and *in the US*. Chain them together.

Or use Tor, which is free &amp; works about the same (but is terribly slow). Tor allows you to host a *service* anonymously. Through fucking-up and deanonymizing yourself  *somehow* is possible (like Ross Ulbricht, eh).

These are just *easiest* ways. And not really about decentralization. *Tech is not a problem, only willingness*. Main disadvantage of these technologies is... slowness. But that should be possible to improve with more users.",fupsaf2,2020-06-14 01:47:07,1

CultureThin,Advcash is legit. Imo there is no good reason to use any bitcoin debit cards though. Normal bank debit cards have lower fees and can be easily reloaded by withdrawing from a bitcoin exchange. The possible speed increase you might get from a BTC debit card doesn't make up for the unreliability and most importantly the fees.

fresheneesz,"A trezor will warn you if the firmware isn't signed, so unless you're blindly pressing go, it shouldn't receive unsigned firmware. However if someone (or ones) who can sign the firmware and can put it up on the website produce malicious firmware, then yes it's possible. 

It's also possible for someone who produces parts for trezor, assembles the device, or ships the device to modify it. The only way to significantly reduce that trust is to use two devices from two completely separate companies to create a multisig wallet. That way you'd know that both those two companies would have to collude or be compromised by the same thief in order for you funds to be stolen.

However, if there is a malicious firmware update out there, the thief is being incredibly careful. A usual thief would want to steal as much as possible as quick as possible to reduce the window of discovery and reduce their chances of getting caught. Since the thousands of people who have trezors aren't all on here yelling about losing coins, this obviously isn't the case. 

So either way, you're probably pretty safe as long as you follow good security practices.

Also, if he was hacked in February and some thief stole over 800 Million GBP worth of Bitcoin at that time, how did CSW fail to notice that until now?

Also, CSW claims to be a cyber-security expert, so why would he keep that huge amount of money in one wallet on his computer, connected to the internet, *without* back-up??

I'm not saying this is happening, but why would it so farfetched that they're trying every trick in the book to try to make cryptocurrencies as unattractive as possible.

Tether is used merely as a convenience - people who use tether are perfectly capable of using USD.  The people holding tether would be screwed.

1) The Trendon Shavers gave legal precedent that Bitcoin is not an illegal security according to the Howey test

2) The IRS has already formalized how it treats Bitcoin (as an asset)

3) Many wealthy and highly connected individuals have personally invested in Bitcoin and they wont be too happy if their peers in politics make Bitcoin illegal

4) Traditional Fintech in the USA like ICE/BAKKT(owner of NYSE) , Fidelity, TD ameritrade, CME, and more are already directly involved in Bitcoin mining, investing and trading.

5) Exchanges like coinbase, square, gemini , and more already are very large companies heavily involved in Bitcoin

6) Many local states has both case law and legislation on Bitcoin making it more difficult to make illegal

7) There is plenty of existing case law in US courts that have shown encryption and code to fall under the 1st amendment protections 

8) Making it illegal would not stop bitcoin but just reflect they are a totalitarian government and an inept one at that because stopping Bitcoin is far more difficult than winning the war on drugs",fuxq8an,2020-06-16 05:03:38,11

HarryZKE,"Hey guys, I wanted to let you know I've dropped my latest issue of my newsletter titled ['Why do people go crazy for Bitcoin?'](https://harryglynn.substack.com/p/why-do-people-go-crazy-for-bitcoin-8a2) I thought it would be a good introduction to what makes cryptocurrencies 'good money' for your average person. Most people think we're super weird so I'm doing my best to explain it from how other people view the space. 

There's a time and a place to name drop Ethereum but sometimes you got to go with Bitcoin for accessibility. 

I want to ask for your support for my Gitcoin grant. I'm trying to get into Ethereum education full time. Starting with my newsletter and also a consultancy business. I'm doing this based on my long held premise that the technology is a 10, and awareness is at a 0. We can RT each other on Twitter all day long about the inevitable mooning but the reality is we're all bobbing along to the whims of whale games while we wait for the rest of the world to wake up to what's going on. I'm doing by best to bring this stuff front and center to every investment and financial professional I can reach out to. My newsletter already has a handful of high profile investors I personally know that would otherwise know nothing about crypto. 

[If you wish to support my grant, you can do so here.](https://gitcoin.co/grants/156/zero-knowledge-education) Every Dai means a lot because of the matching and today is the first day so it would be amazing if I got off to a good start. I'm not going to pretend that a few thousand Dai wouldn't help me a lot. The newsletter at least is truly a public good as it's non-rivalrous and non-excludable. 

This community is in a rare position to play kingmaker for any of these grants as this is home to 90%+ of all people who know how to make a tx on Gitcoin. I can't promise anything but know that I'm doing my best to not just sit here and wait for adoption to come to us. It's a rare circumstance where my incentives are perfectly aligned with the Ethereum community so helping me helps you.

yeahdave4,"Someone posted a great question and so I wrote a long response only to see the post deleted right as I hit submit.   Well too bad I am posting it anyway.

Original post:
&gt;In a worst-case scenario, let's say that crypto is a fad and we're so deep inside of our bubble that we're the only people who haven't figured this out yet. (I know this isn't true, but this is a game.)

&gt;How long do you think you will remain an Eth maximalist if this rocket never launches?

&gt;What would be a triggering event to wake you up from your delusion to make you realize you made a mistake?

&gt; I know these sound like negative questions, anyone who knows me knows that I'm a fanatical moonboi, I'm just curious about our collective intuition.

My response:

This is a great question and one I have been working through myself.  Unfortunately most people will approach this question with  some rendition of ""Well there is no way it will fail so blah blah blah"".

IIt may surprise people to hear me say this but I am looking at this question very critically.  What would cause me to take capital and move to the next thing (and therefore count Eth as a failed launch)?  It likely won't be any one thing but here is some of the things on my list.

1.  Prolonged failure to launch the Eth2 phase 0 genesis block due to not enough initial stakers.
2.  A brain drain of research and engineering talent.
3.  Lack of meaningful adoption of Eth 2 once Phase 1 or 1.5 is complete.
4.  Lack of meaningful independent dapps that are not DeFi.
5.  Failure to ship Phase 1 by the end of 2021.  Phase 0 is the foundation, but Phase 1 is where actual meaningful blockchain transactions/data will be occurring.
6.  Chaos and fracturing of the Eth research/development teams.
7.  Devs/researchers sabotaging Eth for personal gain or for the benefit of third parties.
8.  Bitcoin like complacency
9.  Large hoarders of Eth paralyzing progress

Notice how none of this has to do with the actual price.  All of these are extremely unlikely or the very opposite is occurring.  So ya I think I am going to be around for quite a bit longer.",fv32ely,2020-06-17 12:03:12,13

Max_Jake_Bever,"Whoever supplies the Grayscale daily data - Thank You!  

Currently a 750% Premium for Ether.  To put into perspective, a 20% premium for Bitcoin.  Think about that for a moment.  Grayscale clients are I’m guessing in the top 5% of household wealth, financially educated and probably have financial advisors and they are paying a 750% premium ($2k per Eth).  Do they know something the average investor does not?  I would say a big hell yes.

I have been in the Silver market for (7) years now.  I did my due diligence before investing and I am currently down 43%.  Am I a bad investor?  Historically the silver/gold ratio is 8 to 15 to one ounce of gold.  The current ratio is roughly 100 to one.  Am I still a bad investor or is the pricing discovery mechanism broken and/or has been tampered with?  

This reminds me of a story I read where the head of the Bank of England, was catching his transportation to cross back across the Atlantic after his meeting with the head of the Federal Reserve in the spring of 1929.  He met a couple of young men from the right family’s in England and asked them if they were invested in the market.  He stated that they should reconsider when they get home.  In August/September that year, the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve both raised the going interest rates and the rest is history.

cajunflavoredbob,"So I have several questions. Many of them question whether or not this service should exist in the first place. I hope you understand that I mean you no disrespect when I ask them.

It seems like your service is not an indexer or a server. It looks like it downloads nzb files and stores to contents in your cloud service. Nothing else that I know of exists already that does this all in one. I have many questions and concerns about this.

*  What gave you the idea to start this type of service?
*  Are you aware that most of us use plex/emby/jellyfin for media playback already?
 * Are you going to create your own apps for all platforms like they have already?
*  If you're internal video player is competing with those programs, do you provide support for *at least* the same files types as they do?
*  How much cloud storage space are you offering? 
 * Average usenet local storage is around 2-4TB of space.
*  What are your planned prices for this service? 
 * I can get unlimited google cloud storage for twelve bucks. VPNs for streaming torrents are around five bucks a month.
*  Do you connect with any of my indexers or servers? Do I need to upload the NZB file to your service myself?
 * If you do connect to my other providers, how do you handle authentication?
* What speeds do you offer in terms of downloads to your cloud storage, and also downloads to the end user?
 * I'm assuming here that you do offer direct downloads to the end user. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

**From your webstie:**

* ""We are not a Usenet provider. We are not a Cloud storage provider. We are not a Streaming service provider."" &lt;-- Ok, then what are you? 
 * If you're not providing Usenet access, then I have to purchase my own indexer and server subscription. If you're not storing my files, then I have to pay for my own local or cloud storage. If you're not streaming files I've downloaded, then I have to have my own software. What point does this serve? Am I misunderstanding something? It sounds like you don't do anything but download the actual files, which Sabnzbd and NZBGet both handle fine without a cost.
* ""Stream media files right through your laptop, phone, or tablet."" &lt;-- I must be missing something, because your ""What we are not"" section clearly says you aren't a streaming service. Do you or don't you stream things that are downloaded?
* ""Want to store your files somewhere else? Piece of cake!"" &lt;-- So I can pay you to not stream or store my files? I don't get this.
* ""No need to upload subtitles separately. Just check if your Usenet file already has ones."" &lt;-- Are you just connecting with opensubtitles.org for this? 
 * Since you aren't streaming anything, I'm assuming that you're just matching the title to a subtitle database and passing that on to the customer. Why wouldn't I just use opensubtitles.org for this?
* ""Your data is protected by SSL, and with our offer of bitcoin payments, you can be as anonymous as you want."" &lt;-- This brings up a good point. What logs do you keep?

It sounds like your service is a cloud based downloader, and nothing else. I upload the nzb file to your service, and it downloads the files, then serves that file to my device with optional subtitles. The only benefit I see here is that my personal server wouldn't need to be running to download things. However, if I need to provide my own indexer, server, and storage, then I may as well use a local newznab program to download directly to my device or choice. Unless I'm really misunderstanding here, it doesn't sound like your service provides any real value to the customer if it's only a cloud based nzb downloader.

I know it's a long comment, so I appreciate you taking the time to go through this and answer my questions.",fv5f60j,2020-06-18 03:50:05,5

freeradicalx,"I'm a libertarian socialist, aka left libertarian, aka OG libertarian, aka anarchist (A French anarchist actually coined the term libertarian in the 1890s for use in his anarchist newspaper after the government outlawed identifying oneself as anarchist, the US right later coopted the term in the 1950s to replace a muddying liberalism, pretty much just because it sounded similar). So yeah, I'm a libertarian and I like guns and hate central government. But the ""left"" / ""socialist"" part takes it further than that: Anarchists draw their rejection of the state from their rejection of hierarchy. Hierarchy is our actual enemy and that's why we reject both the state *and* capitalism, both forms of hierarchy. It's also why we laugh at confused ""libertarians"" on the right who reject the state while simultaneously licking oligarchial boot. Its not OK when politicians and cops and the military do it to you but it's apparently OK when Amazon and Facebook and Apple do. My interest in bitcoin isn't to get rich, I do not identify with the wealthy, it's to protect what little value I am allowed to keep from state manipulation and the externalities of capitalism in their game I have been forced to play at a distinct disadvantage. I do not agree with competitive economies, but since I am stuck in one until it collapses I figure I might as well make the most of it and use whatever tricks I can to preserve my autonomy.

I don't expect anyone here to agree with my foundations or appreciate my position except maybe the very last part, but that's quite alright. I'm happy enough with others here understanding where I come from, whether they revile it or not. I'm comfortable knowing that the users of this space come from a variety of ideological origins.",fv657jd,2020-06-18 07:12:54,3
rjmcoin,"I think then you may have missed the point.

Cardano is not (yet) targeting mainstream developers. (2007 .NET). They want to find a niche group of highly skilled developers (Haskell) that have been building mission critical systems for decades (Stock exchanges, Banks, NASA etc) to build the first round of Cardano ""dapps"" with completely new experiences. (iPhone 2007).

What he mentioned about mainstream developers is the fact that today's ecosystem only allows blockchain to be a small component of the development process (Microsoft building identity on Bitcoin).

The server, client, blockchain balance is still primarily OFF the blockchain and therefore most projects are essentially blockchain agnostic (as they should be). The blockchain is just a public or private record system for a small subset of the applications. Most of these magical ""dapps"" can be ground to a halt if you just shut down the servers or client services required to run any ""decentralized"" projects of any use. By example of Cryptokitties, running an entire end-to-end dapp on a decentralized platform is 10-15 years away, the tech just isn't there yet.

In the mean time the regular Javascript, C++, etc.. normies that are extremely susceptible to writing junk code and submitting it to an app store in a ""launch it fast and fix it later"" mentality can still plug away at the server and client side and then use the blockchain that's the most efficient for the small component the blockchain will play.  Plutus offers an experience where there are both on chain and off chain code can exist in the same file so it greatly reduces complexity and room for error, but that's still only a part of the equation.

If you look at developers in crypto, ETH has a large piece of that pie, but maybe around 1% of ""developers"" are developing on blockchain, let alone ETH. This is what he means by fighting in a small pond right beside the ocean. So ETH has ~70% of ~1% is roughly what he's suggesting. (not his words of course)

Regardless, the ""network effect"" echo-chamber seems to be overwhelming otherwise sensible people as well as the snow blind ETH community that has latched onto an idea that just hasn't been fully flushed out. They are working hard and bound and determined that ETH is the future and the only future and I'm sure they will find a way to build a Model-T one day.

In the mean-time Cardano has been building a rocket-ship on a start-from-scratch-with-science approach, already seeing in 2015 where things need to go, and in 6-8 weeks, we're going to have Shelley and shortly after we'll have Goguen.

As ETH tinkers away in their assembly lines and factories with no blue-prints, Cardano is pretty much making the final approach the launch-pad.",fv66q93,2020-06-18 07:26:09,4

cointastical,"What exactly does ""isn't a problem for me"" mean?

Does it mean your employer, landlord, parents, university, etc. are paying for the electricity?  That doesn't mean it is free electricity, it just means someone else is paying.     Or is it that you are in a location where there is more electricity than demand, and thus the cost per kWh is extremely cheap (e.g., West Texas, western Washington State, parts of Quebec with excess hydroelectric power, Tennessee Valley, etc.? 

Anyway, how much are you trying to buy?   If you want $100 worth of BTC per month, you'll need (currently) about 3 Antminer S9s.  Each uses 1,400W, so that means you'll need three outlets each on their own circuit breaker.  

And they are loud as well (like a jet engine in your closet), and three S9s throw off the same heat as does four 1,000W space heaters, so you'll need fans to exhaust that hot air out a window.

Some love/hate Ledger/Trezor. 

There are pros/cons to either but don’t get stressed with the nuance of the arguments. 

Either of them are fine for you, and both are safer than leaving your coins on an exchange. 

Buy one from the manufacturer and not form Amazon or eBay. 

If you are storing a huge amount of money, I’d recommend learning about either using a pass phrase (25th word) or multi-sig (for bitcoin, most alts don’t support multisig). 

When you get your hardware wallet, follow these steps:

1. Create wallet with instructions provided by them
2. Write down your 12/24 word recovery phrase 
3. Send a small amount to your wallet ($10-$15)
4. Delete the wallet 
5. Restore the wallet with the 12/24 word recovery phrase 
6. Send some funds from your wallet to a new address (or back to the exchange)

If you can do all 6 steps, then you are ready to load your wallet with larger funds. 

Never lose and never store your recovery phrase online or on any internet connected device.",fv6ryow,2020-06-18 10:34:18,5

Other forks of bitcoin destroy that argument that Bitcoin is just valuable because it's scarce. It makes it obvious that this is not enough since other coins can be scarce too but at the same time keep the easy to move properties.

1MightBeAPenguin,"Think about it this way: Bitcoin was launched back in 2009, and Satoshi always intended for it to scale, so that it can be used in commerce as more people join the network. Would it make sense for him to make a system in which the blockchain couldn't scale? No, that would be extremely short-sighted, and not make sense for a project that took years to create.

What economic model makes more sense for global adoption, such that everyone can use Bitcoin? High transaction volume with low fees (aka affordable and better for everyone), or low transaction volume with high fees? I think this makes it clear as day as to which economic model is better, and which one is truly a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.

Now Blockstream, the main company that the devs work for are funded by several conflicting interests including, but not limited to AXA Ventures, other banking institutions, and Digital Currency Group which not only is funded by Mastercard, but also has a current federal reserve member on their team. They insist on keeping the blocksize small despite many educated people having debunked the idea that an increase in the blocksize limit will cause harm to centralization.

The blocksize limit was set almost 10 years ago. Wouldn't it make sense to increase it considering that technology including bandwidth, digital storage, computing, and network latency have all improved and ALSO have gotten cheaper? Apparently not to Blockstream and Bitcoin Core (which have become synonymous at this point). If the block limit is set high, everyone will have cheap fees, and transactions that come within the next block.

hugelung,"Idk why there are so many people saying blocks should be small or stay small. It's legitimately crazy to me

For the record, Ethereum handles just ~1.2mb of data every 10 minutes. This is basically just on par with grandaddy Bitcoin. Yes, that produces about 5gb/month. But what's the actual cost there? I can buy a terabyte ssd hard drive for 120$ currently. That would allow me to store 200 months worth of Ethereum blockchain growth!! That's 16.6 YEARS of storage at current rates. By then, storage may be 100x cheaper again

Meanwhile, we have had absurd fees for months that literally eliminate most use cases. Like, just transferring an NFT costs &gt;1$. Guys this is not cool. This directly fucks up my business, flowerpatch.app, and gives most of our profits to the miners

Even if you truly believe in l2, that only works if we can actually scale the base layer as well. Remember, people need to use l1 to move funds in and out of l2s. Also, l2 adoption is clearly not ready

Meanwhile, ETH is working on several mitigations for the amount of data stored. We have alternate data structures, stateless sync, partial sync, and Eth2 sharding coming up

In short, we have had high fees for 1.5 months, driving out many usecases. The storage need is at the same level as BTC. We need bigger blocks even with l2. Miners are making the right call here, to raise the gas limit!

Edit: one metric that shows whether eth can raise the gas limit is the uncle rates. This signals all green currently, with historic low rates: https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_uncle_rate",fvcym23,2020-06-20 02:57:49,2

bitjson,"Hi everyone,

I've been working on [Libauth](https://github.com/bitauth/libauth) (previously `bitcoin-ts`) for a couple of years now – the goal is to make a flexible, lightweight, and easily auditable Bitcoin Cash JavaScript library.

Libauth has no dependencies, and it works in all JavaScript environments, including Node.js, Deno, and browsers. Some highlights:

* **Flexibility** – Even highly-complex functionality is built-up from simpler functions. These lower-level functions can be used to experiment, tweak, and remix your own higher-level methods without maintaining a fork of the library.
* **Smaller application bundles** – Applications can import only the methods they need, eliminating the unused code (via [dead-code elimination](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/)).
* **Better auditability** – Beyond having no dependencies of its own, Libauth's [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) approach makes auditing critical code easier: smaller bundles, smaller functions, and less churn between versions (fewer cascading changes to object-oriented interfaces).
* **Fully-portable** – No platform-specific APIs are ever used, so the same code paths are used across all JavaScript environments (reducing the auditable ""surface area"" and simplifying library development).

This makes Libauth a really strong choice for Bitcoin Cash libraries, CLIs, and browser applications: you may be able to cut down your list of dependencies, and (with dead-code elimination) your library can be much lighter-weight than if you used one of the more monolithic libraries (like bitcore-lib, bitcoin-js, and bcoin derivatives).

If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer them here, or feel free to drop into the [Bitauth Telegram group](https://t.me/bitauth) too. Thanks!",fvdcroq,2020-06-20 04:54:27,3

CryptoDae,"1) Yes you are right. My bad. I was referring to the ROI from coinmarketcap.com without checking. But you're right. The ICO went until 04 Jun 2018.

2) Ok got that point. I hope b1 still have a lot of that money. I doesn't see a problem to first develop the ecosystem better and start with marketing when its ready. A company like block.one will have a lot more costs than just pay salary for developers. I think it will not only be 4%. 

3) Its just what I see is that block.one use the money to grow the whole EOSIO ecosystem, which in the end will benefit EOS as the mainchain. Like ERC20 token benefited Ethereum. But EOSIO is IBC ready. And that was clear from the beginning that this will be an architecture with horizontal scaling. 

I got in EOS actually around Januar 2018. I made a good profit with bitcoin, invested in EOS and lost all my profit again. Waiting since today, that the price will go up again. But if I would have invested in Ethereum instead of EOS, I would lost the money as well. 

The only thing what I am saying is that EOS is not a chinese cartel, nor a shitcoin and clearly not a scam. I see the technology and the amazing application which developers build and keep believing in it. 

I don't have any problem with anybody who think if they are b1, they would have decided differently. But I am pretty sure, they could have done everything different, the price still would be the same, because crypto is in a bear market. Maybe the price would be instead of 2.50 it would be 5 or 8. But that would not make any difference for all this people who are so shitting about EOS, just because they choose the wrong time to invest. I bet with you as soon the bull market starts and EOS start increasing with the price again (and maybe b1 start the marketing because they are ready with their products) everybody will be happy again. I just have enough to read all this false accusations and decided to do something against it. I have nothing against facts or critisism.

Overall you will only get a good return it the price of bitcoin rises significantly, and get a negative return if bitcoin falls in price.  So you will get a better return owning crypto if the price goes up or lending out a stable coin if the price falls.

Either way I don't think it is worth using Bitmex to earn interest this way.  To be clear I still think bitmex is good to use for other things, like using leverage while most of your coins stay safe in your wallet.

Take whatever link you find first, go to it on TOR

Send bitcoin from a public exchange where you have verified your identity directly to your market wallet.

When your bitcoin is in your wallet, find the cheapest vendor for your product.

Add the quantity you want, click order, add in your address. Its important to write this clearly so it gets delivered properly.

Make sure to always finalize the order straight away. Vendors always give you extra goodies for finalising early.

Central_Authority,"Paypal and bitcoin are the only option during minimal viable product phase. More will be added in phase 2.

Neither a pyramid or scam. In a pyramid scheme you invest in company ABC and are paid when they get person 2 to invest. You are not investing in Central Authority Coins you are purchasing coins.

We control the price using price maintenance agreements which all members enter into. Everyone is legally bound by the agreement. You can't sell it for your own prices. 

If the system becomes over supplied with coins and sell orders exceed buy orders, it will result in sellers waiting longer to sell their coins. (In otherwords if more people are selling than buying). This is solved in 3 steps. First, CAC will stop creating new coins. Second, a 1-3% transaction fee is charged for each transaction. The coins collected from those fees are destroyed. Third, when a buyer requests a refund for purchased coins, those coins are destroyed. This reduces coin supply and balances the system.",fvgzrcj,2020-06-21 05:20:05,1

I don't know when did the ecosystem start to treat P2PK as if it's P2PKH, however this has involved too many historical posts, so that such change to Bitcoin Core is on the contrary making things more confusing IMHO.

To me it's similar to the case of ""bitcoin doesn't have any from address!"" - yeah of course a transaction itself doesn't contain such thing, but the tuple of previous txid and vout uniquely points to the previous output item, so that it's definitely the ""from address"". Like it or not it's just how bitcoin works.

CCalith,"I think some here are missing the point.

&amp;#x200B;

The main thing about Bitcoin Cash is utility. It works better as peer to peer electronic cash than Bitcoin Core. The point of the fork was to keep it true to purpose and vision. Bitcoin Core advocates don't even try to pretend that Bitcoin Core is peer to peer electronic cash anymore, and instead fall back on the platitude that it is a store of value. In other words, it doesn't have any utility whatsoever, except for being a ponzi scheme to park your capital, in the hopes it appreciates in USD so you can exit your position before the next guy.

&amp;#x200B;

What some of the Bitcoin Core people realized a while back is that even with large blocks, Bitcoin (or Bitcoin Cash) can never achieve Visa-level transaction throughput. So while Bitcoin Cash has a path to achieve many hundreds of transactions per second, far superior to Bitcoin Core, it can never compete with Visa in the many thousands of transactions per second. 

&amp;#x200B;

AVA on the other hand, uses an entirely new consensus protocol that gets Visa-level transaction throughput now, with payment finality in under two seconds. It's scaleable and efficient. It's intended to be a platform of platforms, providing the layer one substrate that all projects can work off of to build their own value-added propositions. 

&amp;#x200B;

AvaLabs are not interested in yet another cryptocurrency as peer to peer electronic cash. They are interested in building a platform for digitizing real-world assets, where each independently developed sub-platform controls the parameters for their own governance, while utilizing the efficient and scalable layer one consensus protocol provided out of the box on the AVA network. This is huge, because it means that even traditional institutions who are looking for some kind of blockchain-type solution, but who don't want a purely decentralized model that is completely out of their control, can also be onboarded according to their unique governance requirements.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides, the folks heading up AvaLabs are honest folks from well-respected academic institutions who have received $6m in funding from top investment firms. They've turned away much more capital, as they don't want to fall into the all-too-common trap of getting overfunded and losing focus. But don't take my word for it. Do some research, watch a few interviews with Emin Gün Sirer and you will get a better understanding for what they're doing.

&amp;#x200B;

What I would love to see is Bitcoin Cash ported to run on the AVA network, replacing the PoW consensus protocol with PoS Avalanche consensus and immediately reaping the rewards of Visa-level transaction throughput. IMO, the first large-cap cryptocurrency intended primarily as peer to peer electronic cash (Bitcoin?, Bitcoin Cash, Monero, Dash, Litecoin, Zcash, etc.) that makes this transition will eventually become the cryptocurrency that wins the peer to peer electronic cash race.",fvh3zk4,2020-06-21 06:00:10,1

Think about it: you have people running around destroying things that were produced by the society (body). If this were a human's body, we'd call them pathogens without blinking an eye.

This is symbolically a disease ravaging our body (society). If you look, they're taking down Washington, Jefferson, they tore down a Grant statue, and defaced the Lincoln memorial.

This has NOTHING to do with racism or slavery - if it did, the Left wouldn't be allies with Muslims (Mohammed was a slave owner). Why deface Lincoln or topple Grant? They freed slaves!

No. This is a deliberate attempt to undermine the basis of western civilization. Columbus brought the most technologically advanced civilization to the new world, and the same civilization came to be the first in all history to make slavery illegal.

The desire to abolish slavery - and institute the freest  government ever - all stems from Christianity (which obviously stemmed from Judaism). The same people toppling these statues are also atheists - it's not a coincidence.

We should be very happy that someone brought ""the wheel"" to a new place that didn't have it. Read the primary sources: a huge number of tribes in the New World were cannibals.

Jstodd_,"&gt;but PoW is still way more efficient than fiat. 

Im not sure about that. Centralized systems like used in fiat are pretty efficient compared to POW. Distributed systems cost more, for the obvious reason that more computers are doing it. 

Cost efficiency goes more like:

FIAT &gt; POS &gt; POW

With avalanche being one of the most efficient in the POS category.



&gt;I just see POS go the way of government. A few entities will gain too many coins and eventually try to create mandatory fees or inflation because that’s what their incentive is.

Actually, they are more incentivized to look out for the protocol because their wealth is on the line. And since ethusuasts can participate, they chip in. Miners care less, because they just want short term profit.

&gt; A few entities will gain too many coins

Maybe. But also on Bitcoin, there is an average of 4 mining pools that make up 51% of the network. Just 4. You can verify on coin.dance. If POS has better distribution, then this should be a nonissue.

&gt;I’m still not convinced the effectiveness of forking because those entities can anonymize their coins and it won’t be easy to tell who owns what coins unless you’re going to ban anyone who votes for inflation (malicious or because they think it’s good food them) in the new fork which silencing opinions always leads to a bad outcome

Because without a single new adopter and at any given time as current wallet holders increase their purchases and holdings market cap increases, and therefore it in itself is not necessarily an indicator of greater adoption",fvk40rm,2020-06-22 03:08:23,1

globzero,"Test net uses testcoins. Play money. It's very important to have that. If you develop a wallet, test something on lightning, implement it on a webshop etc, you start out with test net.

BigBlockIfTrue,"It doesn't work in practice. You can't reset the fork identifier to 0 for Bitcoin ABC every six months and simultaneously force anyone you disagree with to not do the same. You cannot control the consensus rules others choose. And because of the ""extra work required by exchanges, wallets, and other developers"", there is a significant incentive to keep the 0 identifier, unless you are absolutely sure you will be a minority.

For this reason, Automatic Replay Protection failed miserably at the only time in its history it would have been useful: when Bitcoin SV split off.

Without theoretical benefits materialising in practice, the costs (a rigid upgrade schedule with forced software updates even if there is no change, users having it activate unintentionally) are probably not worth it.

Either way I am not advocating for Bitcoin ABC to drop Automatic Replay Protection. Every implementation can safely make their own decision on this issue. If Bitcoin ABC likes it, they should keep it in. If all other nodes don't like it, they should keep it out. Automatic Replay Protection never activates if people keep their node up-to-date, and developers can decide for their own nodes what should happen to them when they are not up-to-date.",fvk51hp,2020-06-22 03:17:30,1
Dugg,"BCH is decentralised, in a sense that the software is entirely open source, and the distributed hash secures the network. Question is, if the hash and code is controlled against the will of the community and users, would they be willing to continue with their own fork? interestingly, ABC are planning to continue with the 'upgrades' so all it would take is for users to refuse the upgrade and continue on the same path - arguably ABC would then fork against the BCH community, rather than the other way.

If you are asking if LN is possible on BCH, sure, and I would also argue if BCH is going to be successful, it should follow the same route. Many of the cons for LN such as transaction fees are less of an issue on BCH whilst providing the added privacy that LN could provide.

LN is decentralised also, if you believe BCH is, it follows a very similar model except with more implementations of the protocol.
No reason why an honest player couldn't follow the same rule set, or even contribute back to the spec. Bitcoin and BCH are fundamentally the same even if there has been a change of direction over the past few years.",fvk5lzt,2020-06-22 03:22:37,2

Best conspiracy theory I've read in ages because well it's accurate. The push of stablecoins or fiat backed cryptocurrency by the banking industry is because stablecoins have the transparency of cryptocurrency (surveillance plus!) with the market manipulation of fiat currencies. None of the forced scarcity of Bitcoin, all of the FED money magic of the USD is what every stablecoin is about. There are pushes to build private systems to get around the transparent nature of the new system by building intra-network financial systems for the biggest corporations, so they themselves won't have their transactions scrutinized. 

Cryptocurrency was an existential threat to the banking industry, so it adopted, evolved, and survived in a way that let's it continue to be king. Now the threat of cryptocurrency is neutralized and the surveillance state expanded heartily.",fvk9dhi,2020-06-22 03:56:07,1

I'll try to answer some of your questions...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Is there a way to know when the Cardano network will achieve 100% of circulating supply (and the minting process comes to an end)?

Its hard coded - see the [delegation design specification](https://hydra.iohk.io/build/3156413/download/1/delegation_design_spec.pdf): T∞ is the maximal amount of ada to ever be in circulation (i.e., 45 x 10\^9 ada).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;How is the “minting” rate? I mean, stakers gain rewards for verifying the network from newly minted ada coins, right? And there is a fixed maximum supply, so, how much ada is minted per block? Are there halvings like in bitcoin and similar chains or is this a fixed minting rate or it is dynamic and tied to the # of tx or something..? 

[https://youtu.be/NaR5W78eFo4?t=1417](https://youtu.be/NaR5W78eFo4?t=1417)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I’m not a techy guy so this is probably why I didn’t understand this, but, what is this about two protocol coding languages (rust and Haskell)? There are two teams developing the code at the same time in different code languages?

[Rust vs Haskell testnets](https://youtu.be/K6_EcEMbFoY?t=0&amp;ref=adatainment)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;How long does an ADA tx takes to have full confirmation?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Someone told me that, in the future, the project is going to be self-funded, since a part of the fees from txs are sent to the treasury and the community votes on how to spend it. Is there a way to know how much the treasury has accumulate until now? Are these funds stored on a public address or something?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Is the Cardano foundation financial situation public? I mean, the dev team has a fixed cost, how can I know how many time the foundation is going to be able to fund them? Are their financial situation public or just from suppositions based on talking?

Plus there's the Crypto FED called Tether which is making paper-paper USD with which Bitfinex can pump BTC/USDT price anywhere they want. Without this ""crypto quantitative easing"", BTC would be $1000 - $1500, and Monero would be peanuts.

The fear of delisting is too much for the ""investors"" I guess, so they skip Monero.

Then, there's all these shitcoin tokens which appeared out of nowhere with $1B+ market cap. Coins older than 5 years are considered garbage. If you don't make 100x returns under a year, forget about that coin.

Crypto is a sad bunch of rudely awakened dreamers, I have to concur. No one believes in crypto store of value or means of exchange anymore. Governments turned out to be overpowered and unbeatable. Even that guy XMR2020 who was hyper-bullish on Monero, changed his Moon/Global adoption target to 2030 or never, whatever happens first.

But hey, I'm still here.

Except for the most obvious: That as a supply-inelastic asset class Bitcoin's periodic supply restriction is what drives crypto business cycles. 

Every halvening there is a slew of projects that hope to piggyback on these cycles as if to say ""see, my project is so important, look what it did for the Bitcoin price"" or alternatively, ""see how quickly my crypto project is gaining value based upon its own merits"" and then they proceed to fade in to relative obscurity as the next slew of projects capture momentary attention.",fvsf1r2,2020-06-24 07:02:47,7

Why? Well, it's not because the people there are better. I get trolled often, and image-quote Tweeted on the regular by Bitcoin Maxis, whose comments I can't even see because they've blocked me.

The only reason I do it is because I feel like I'm helping to expose Ethereum to new eyeballs. Twitter is not a great place for remotely serious discussion, but hot takes can make people think...even enough to put aside their past preconceptions about Ethereum. And I feel like it has made a difference for Ethereum, and the perception of ETH (especially among the trader-types).

lemineftali,"I’ve been wondering why bitcoin is tracking the SPX all of the sudden for months now, and I have an answer that makes some small amount of sense—and I don’t like it. Get your tin foil hats ready guys, because this one, while pragmatic, is a stretch. 

So cue up 2020, the economy is suddenly collapsing—we are well into the information wars, and now we are in the beginning stages of the currency wars. Covid hits the US, Congress passes the CARES Act, and suddenly the administration has $500 billion to be spent however they see fit, and they aren’t going to tell us where the money is going. 

So at first I was like any other person—“oh, they fired the watchdog committee, this is an obvious sign of corruption, they must just be pocketing the money”. But what if they are just using that half a trillion dollars in liquidity to continue to manipulate markets around the world—including bitcoin?

Because even if this is all insane, and I’m completely wrong, it seems like no one stands to benefit more from bitcoin having the same ceiling as the SPX. Trump has said he hates cryptocurrencies. Central banks have really never been more threatened by them than this year, when they are forced by circumstance to turn on their printers to save their people. 

How do they keep bitcoin from going to the moon, especially after the halving? By trying to get everyone else to make the correlation stick. It’s a small price to pay now.

mvxkrs,"I was one of the people that did not like the video that was posted. I made fun out of it at my quick glance at the video, but I admit I was ignorant and do not follow much Youtuber crypto accounts. 

So in all fairness, I decided to educate myself. I have now spent 30 minutes looking into this guys account, his post history a decade ago, and his post history in the past year. It is not exhaustive research, but I think is a fair light weight, high level analysis and helps to balance this post validating and providing credence to this youtuber.

Davincij15 was extremely prescient in 2011. He also talked about Ripple in 2015, and appeared to be interested in the technology, and was very objective and avoided specific price predictions. 

More recently however, he is making wildly subjective price prediction videos, like this one 9 months ago where he states Bitcoin was going to $15,000 ‘imminently’: https://youtu.be/5zjkdqqu35w

Comparing his video from nearly a decade ago to the one posted previously in the daily is comparing apples to oranges. His previous videos he stated he did not know the price movement one could anticipate, but that at the current price, it seems undervalued. This video from even 2 years ago seems objective, he thinks another bubble will happen, doesn’t know when or to what magnitude, but believes value will increase: https://youtu.be/boutqoS0YaE

He is now posting videos predicting price increases in a very short period of time, that other cryptos will 100x and posting alongside other ‘cringey’ youtubers that use titles that look like ‘INSAAANEEE!!! BITCOIN BREAKOUT TO PRICE IMMINENT &amp; ALTCOIN 100X’.

He might be right about 100x for Vechain. I sure hope he is. But I think it’s fair to say, he appears to have changed his actions in the past 2 years and his motives and credibility seem spurious.",fvwmonh,2020-06-25 08:52:16,5

palacechalice,"The thing that really strikes me about this order is Bloom doesn't seem to even attempt to evaluate the evidence. In that way, it's very conspicuously different from other rulings during this case. She recounts almost all of the arguments, but she only opines on a few bits (more on this later). Then she says:

&gt; Importantly, virtually all of the concerns raised as to the evidentiary matters at hand are fact-intensive, context-based, and require credibility determinations to resolve. They also rest on the Court making factual determinations that ultimately affect issues that go to the heart of this case. In other words, while the underlying determinations presented in the Motion ordinarily reside squarely within the provenance of a jury to decide at trial, Plaintiffs instead present them to the Court to sort out.

Indeed, the plaintiff's evidence is fact-intensive and comprehensive, but it is also mostly uncontested. Quite often, the defendant's response amounted to ""this was forged before the litigation started so the defendant isn't responsible for the fact it's forged"" (which, by the way, wasn't true for all the forgeries; some were provably forged for this litigation); they never really rebutted most of the evidence.

By handwaving away the plaintiff's evidence, she's essentially punishing the plaintiff for doing their job really well. I guess they should've stuck to a few key points and ignored the rest so Bloom wouldn't feel overwhelmed!

And what about the evidence Bloom did evaluate. Let's go point-by-point:

&gt; Plaintiffs also assert that Defendant produced fabricated evidence during the course of this action, but Defendant counters that he has produced nearly two million pages of documents

Um, that doesn't sound like a counter. Why would producing 2 million documents excuse producing forged documents? Maybe the reasoning is that there are so many documents, some are bound to be forged?

Furthermore, the plaintiffs are entitled to the documents they are entitled to after agreeing on keyword searches over a year ago -- let's not pat the defense on the back for producing the documents that they were legally required to. In fact, from following this case, I've gotten the picture that the defense often produced large volumes of irrelevant documents (that don't seem to come from any keyword search they agreed to) to hide important ones.

&gt; Similarly, although Plaintiffs challenge the veracity of the family law settlement, the Tulip Trust III,  the  W&amp;K  operating  agreement,  bitmessages,  the  CSW  Filed  List,  and  other  documents, Defendant points to deficiencies in Plaintiffs’ characterizations of the evidence  and the claimed inconsistencies. Id.at 17-25

I checked her citation ranging 9 pages of the defendant's response. I have no clue what she is referring to with ""deficiencies in Plaintiffs' characterizations"". This is among the most egregious handwaving I've ever seen. She entirely fails to acknowledge evidence that the ""family law settlement, the Tulip Trust III,  the  W&amp;K  operating  agreement,  bitmessages,  the  CSW  Filed  List,  and  other  documents"" are forged with this tiny little paragraph. Each one of these accusations was backed by unimpeachable evidence (with the _possible_ exception of the family law settlement"") -- cryptographic evidence quite often, and she just ignores it.

To bolster her reasoning that most of these matters are for the jury to decide and not the judge, she quotes another case:

&gt; And “perjury and  fabricated evidence do not constitute fraud upon the court, because they ‘are evils that can and should be exposed at trial.’”

How in the world are the plaintiffs supposed to bring this up to the jury at the trial? The jury doesn't care about what happened during discovery. Do the plaintiffs just tack onto their closing arguments, ""oh by the way, the defendant forged hundreds of documents, forced us to spend several months of work and hundreds of thousands of dollars to hire expert witnesses in case they use them at trial; they tried to get the suit dismissed four separate times with forgeries; we still don't know what Craig's actual bitcoin holdings are and can't trace them which is pretty important to our case to prove damages. Could you guys figure out some remedy for all this because the judge didn't bother and punted it to you guys?""",fvwvcvy,2020-06-25 10:35:35,3

TheRealRogers, Crypto applies more to the digital realm- in the case of ethereum and other smart contract based blockchains they do a lot of things a precious metal can’t do.  I think if you are looking at it from a purely currency perspective then you may say that options like bitcoin can be debated.  At the end of the day the reason you would purchase ether is much different than the reason you would purchase a precious metal.   I sense that maybe people are trying to compare two things that aren’t truly in the same category.,fvzuiry,2020-06-26 06:11:34,7
spit-evil-olive-tips,"First you want to understand the original problem blockchain &amp; bitcoin were trying to solve.

If I hand you cash, that's a *two-party* financial transaction. Just me and you. If I use a credit or debit card, or a check, or Venmo, or whatever, that's a *three-party* (or more) transaction. Companies get involved, paper trails get created, etc. So it's obvious why anyone buying &amp; selling drugs, or anything else like that, prefers two-party transactions.

Pre-Bitcoin, two-party financial transactions on the internet were basically impossible. If I hand you a $20 bill, you know that I no longer have possession of the bill, so I can't spend it again. That doesn't work on the internet. If I had some way of emailing you a file representing a virtual $20 bill, there'd be nothing stopping me from emailing the same file to someone else. This is called the double-spending problem. So pre-Bitcoin pretty much everything on the internet was a three-party transaction, involving an intermediary like Paypal.

The idea behind blockchain is that it creates a permanent &amp; unchangeable public ledger. In order to send you $20 worth of Bitcoin, I have to publicly announce it, and it gets written into a ledger in a way that it can't be taken back. And the ledger records the equivalent of the serial number of the $20. So I can't double-spend that $20 because the 2nd recipient of it can detect that I already spent it once and it doesn't belong to me anymore. It's not *really* a two-party transaction, because there's a ton of other parties involved (every miner in the Bitcoin network), but it has the ability to be mostly-sorta-untraceable-if-you-do-it-right the way cash does.

That's the gist of it. There's a bunch more problems around making sure transaction records are sufficiently anonymized (because they're public and need to be, forever, for the system to work), the cryptographic details of the proof-of-work scheme, the ridiculous goddamn electricity usage, the artificial ""exchange rate"" between USD and Bitcoin, etc etc. Plus the ridiculous degree to which techbros think you can sprinkle blockchain fairy dust onto any problem and solve it.",fvzznyv,2020-06-26 06:53:25,6

mkgll,"I agree with BSV and BTC. I think the BCH \*ideal\* is as you described, and I also think it rarely lives up to it these days like it has in the past.

1/ r/BTC has had crypto purity checker bots for over a year now to flag you if you post in a BSV subreddit. That's not 'censorship,' strictly speaking, but it's manipulative and has a chilling effect of preventing people from discussing certain things on this subreddit or from listening to ideas in other forums.

2/ The most popular BCH Telegram groups censor and delete content all the time. I have seen videos that criticized SV heavily get removed because it also said a few nice things about SV. That's not a sign of a healthy community open to ideas.

3/ Steve Patterson—one example among money—was scheduled to debate BCH vs BTC on the Hotep Jesus Show and a group of \*well known\* BCHers, who I won't name here, emailed and harassed Hotep to have him removed from the show. Hotep later reinvited Steve for another show once he realized how crazy this all was.

4/ Blocksize caps and central planning of use cases are the worst form of censorship because they prevent certain business models from developing. Most of the important developers in BCH have made clear that, for example, people who want to use the chain for data usages should look elsewhere. And so projects like Satoshi Dice have posted they are considering leaving BCH and projects like [Memo.Cash](https://Memo.Cash) have said they don't necessarily see a future for them on BCH.

5/ Prior to the IFP disaster, several individuals involved in BOTH ABC and BCHN organized a core-style ""enemies of Bitcoin Cash"" list that was passed around on Telegram, on Twitter and in Reddit comments. Later when the IFP was opposed, the same thing was done towards opposition and continues to be done today.

There are many more examples.

In some ways, none of this is on the level of SV lawsuits against developers and businesses or BTC trolling, doxxing, harassment, lawsuits, threats, sockpuppetry, censorship, information manipulation, DDossing, lying, etc etc etc etc.

In other ways, as someone who has been involved in Bitcoin Cash since the beginning, its sad and frustrating, and it feels like the slope is downhill from here and many of the standards we once had for discussions have been watered down to the point of non-existence.",fw01728,2020-06-26 07:06:33,5

Foxxinator37,"Cardano is using Plutus for its smart contracts and will be easier to use and integrate to than developing code. If you look at Ethereum you have plug and play Erc20 tokens already available with browser interfaces. Smart contracts and secure governance is going to be a game changer and we are just getting started. 

Lots of different projects show good promise but Crypto is kind of in the early pilot phase right now. Its showing promise and it has the foundations being laid in place but we need people to adopt the technology by developing on top of it. Its still reserved for those quite technical and hasn't become mainstream but it is getting there. 

How many people would have heard of Bitcoin of Ethereum 10 years ago? 

Do you think the Internet was cool 10 years into its development cycle? We have taken a long time to get to the richness in functionality that you have available on even your mobile phone these days. If a big project rushes development they may not get a second chance so by nature they can take some time to deploy new changes. It also isn't like we have a lot of history and examples to follow in this space. It seems like everyday there is news coming out showing where a different project is doing something new. 

A lot of people are not patient enough and want the finished perfect product right now. It's going to take time to get there and actually probably won't get there until new innovators join the space. How Crypto is used in 50 years time is going to be drastically different than how it exists today.

Imnotusuallysexist,"Maybe so, but I'm sure as hell enjoying ilthe illusion.

Nobody is going to replace money, we'd have to go back to pigs and chickens in baskets.... Fiat currency is just too powerful of a tool of social control. But it is going to change.  

No amount of wishing will make people continue to use a tool that burns them, when a tooll that makes life better for them and does the same job is at hand.

  Crypto has a long way to go to be that tool for most people, but every day bitcoin is worth more than zero,  it gets a little closer.

The whole covid thing has opened up a lot of eyes to the false assumptions thay have had about the way the world works.

 Most will go back to being drones, of course... But some won't... And the ones that don't are the ones to watch, ultimately.

 As much as this is serving to be the ""reset"" that global banking has craved, I think in the end it will hurt them more than they understand. Not financially, of course, but when people believe less in the lies you tell them, the costs are often incalculable. 

If you are in the position you claim to be, there's no downside to going over early. You'll be there one day anyway, if you live long enough.

 If you've got a lot of money, you know how much of a pain in the ass it can be to move, how it restricts your freedom, the burden it entails, and the useless inertia it creates.

You can change a lot of that for yourself, if you want.

Cardano ADA is going to redefine this entire space. With Shelly ADA will be instantly one of the most decentralised cryptocurrencies. Many times more decentralised than bitcoin itself. Then comes smart contracts by end of year meaning it will more than rival Ethereum. Voltaire which adds a treasury and community voting system allows the network to fully fund itself for future upgrades is also on track for end of year.

The tech behind it will be the best in the industry and is fully peer reviewed and independently audited by third parties. Meaning I'd expect this is where government and institutional money will flow. Coinbase listing is almost definitely coming shorty after release of shelly too etc etc etc. The three entities behind Cardano are huge and constantly working so there is far too much to going on to mention here so please do yourself a favour and explore it or miss the boat.

This means you may have some difficulty cashing out to USD if that is your aim.

What you could do is start mining now and start to accumulate some coin.

nullc,"Yes, I'm angry. I'm angry that despicable scammers like you fraudulently trade on the Bitcoin name and prey on the technical ignorance of ordinary people to enrich yourselves at their expense.

&gt;  that Bitcoin Cash exists ... not in consensus when SW activated

BCH (or BCC as it was called then, until someone realized that using the same name to help offload bitconnect bags had bad optics) existed well before then, ever since it was created by Bitmain in a naked takeover attempt that ultimately caused them more than a billion dollars in losses.

The lesson you should take away from that is: Fuck with bitcoin, get wreaked.

When segwit activated &gt;90% of nodes were running segwit enforcing software (when bcash was created too).  And fortunately, the remaining 10% weren't screwed because segwit is backwards compatible.

In the last BCash hardfork only about half the nodes were compatible the rest were knocked off the network, out of consensus. LOL.  Similar happened in prior forks and as a result BCH is now down to just a few hundred nodes.  Originally you and your co-scammers bragged about many implementations, but most of them have been forked off the network through your ""upgrades"" and are now unusable. There is even BSV which was created because BCH's authorities insisted on forcing CTOR-- still unused years later-- onto everyone, other implementations like ""bitcoin xt"" just gave up in response.

&gt; and upgrade on schedule just like Bitcoin did from the beginning

Bitcoin was never hardforked by Satoshi-- upgrades have always been done the same way in bitcoin: via softforks.

&gt; so back to my original statement that the actual space usage of SW blocks is hidden with accounting tricks

Repeating your lie without any basis or substantiation doesn't make your lie any more true or convincing.  I showed everyone outright how the actual size is computed and displayed right there, unmolested and unhidden in the size field returned in the bitcoin software.

What have you shown? *absolutely nothing*.  Instead you just tell the same tired old lies over and over again. Boring and  repetitive. ""BEEP BOOP BCASH IS THE REAL BITCOIN. SEGWIT IS FLAWED AND HAS TECHNICAL DEBT BEEP BOOP. INSERT COIN TO CONTINUE."" 

And we're left back at the original point. You fraudulently claimed that because of segwit, if Bitcoin were to hardfork to a larger blocksize limit it would saddled with using more resources for the same limit compared to just directly making that hardfork in the first place.  This is an extraordinary baseless lie which you keep repeating to convince your victims that the shitcoins you're selling them aren't shit.

If some blocksize hardfork didn't want to use weight and instead wanted to limit itself on the size of the standard on-disk serialization, it simply would do so-- and wouldn't be any more complicated as a result of the history. Your claim is a lie, plain and simple.

The fact that you and the various bcash developers spread and allow lies like this to persist demonstrates your complete absence of integrity and ethics.  The result forms part of an *ethical debt* that bcash will never be able to recover from.

&gt; actual space usage has a cost, a cost that is hidden with accounting tricks that is more than just a getblocksize

You ninjaed in this sentence-- but the size returned in the interface is the actual complete and total size on disk. There is no hidden anything there.  I chose a specific block as an example. If I was being untruthful about its size you could counter with whatever size you claim it actually has.  But I am not.  The size returned there is just the size... the actual size, the space it takes up on an unpruned full node. There is no greater size or hidden cost there. There is no interaction with pruning, or segwit or anything else. It's just the size.

I *know* you know all this already, but people read lies like yours and get tricked because they can't believe that someone would be so audacious to tell such obvious lies with such confidence. This exactly how they are tricked by Wright.  ... I am so fucking sick and tired of it.

You need to stop the bullshit now, dirtbag.

How about we agree to a wager?  I say the size of 0000000000000000000b83dd8b5891ba9dffa52b0f17b5a571e00c5d9feb8124 on disk is 1142782 bytes, just as my node reports in the size field of the getblock command.

Ideologically, no matter how much one would like for this to be the case, Avalanche simply cannot achieve the same level of maturity as Ethereum or Bitcoin within a few months or even a year. Avalanche is a powerful piece of tech, but it is still early. Time is a must in order for the ecosystem to develop to its full potential. 

A metropolis is NOT built in a day. It takes time.

To your point about Avalanche being centralized, I think it's very important to offer some clarifications:

&gt; 1. STAKING: You guys will own the vast majority of all the tokens thus also all the staking rewards!

The foundation's mission for staking is security, not economic gain. The foundation is will be taking all the steps needed to ensure staking rewards to go to the community. More details on this to come soon. The foundation is exploring various mechanisms, including a potential burn of the staking rewards from ALL coins minted by the foundation. 

&gt; 2 &amp; 3 FUNDING &amp; GOVERNANCE

In my opinion, the main priority for Avalanche should be to launch a network that solves the biggest challenges in crypto and DeFi today (transaction velocity, latency, security, network congestion, costly hardware requirements, etc.) AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, and start accumulating a large base of builders. Community of token holders is incredibly important, but in my opinion, a singular distribution event through token sales seems counter-productive to the long term benefits of Avalanche. 

Governance is on the roadmap, but launching a network that solves all of those issues is most critical as it's what has been holding the entire ecosystem back. I worry personally very much about governance, and I think Avalanche's future development MUST (not should) be democratic. As long as anyone of the team members have any influence whatsoever, it must be the case that the community is to be listened to in full. 

&gt; 3. DEVELOPMENT: You guys are the sole developers of the avalanche client and network code, as there are no other independent teams. Ethereum has over easily over 10 INDEPENDENT development teams. Tezos has like 4. Cardano has 2 or 3 as well. Monero has several.

Comparing Avalanche to networks with multiple years of lead time isn't exactly apples to oranges, although I'd argue Avalanche holds up incredibly well. It's taken the Ava Labs team less than a year to be on the cusp of mainnet with more functionality than many networks you mention have now. There's also a Python implementation underway (very advanced), and a Rust implementation that is starting soon (from independent party). 

But, we unquestionably agree that expanding the developer network on Avalanche is paramount to future success. That's why we focused the distribution and token structure to reward developers and stakers who participate in the protocol, over fueling speculators who don't create value on the network.",fwlqf6i,2020-07-02 02:30:45,4

Armor_of_Inferno,"I've told this story on Reddit before, but this might illustrate why Primerica is particularly bad.

I blame Primerica for the death of my best friend.

His name was Vance, and we'd been bros since he moved to town at age 13.  He was smart, witty, and had the kind of technical savvy that would have made him a Bitcoin millionaire.  Unfortunately he developed brain cancer at age 17, and had to have some pretty serious surgeries to fix it, but he came out in full remission.  He needed regular brain imaging every 6 months to ensure he stayed in remission, and if not, so that they could catch it early enough to treat him.

Vance was unfortunately surrounded by family who were all trying to get rich quick.  He had pulled me into my first pyramid scheme at age 18.  Selling long distance calling cards, if you can believe that.  The 90's were a weird time.   Anyway, we'd both been around the MLM block and knew what to watch out for.

Primerica was different though.  He asked me to go with him to a group interview at age 23, and they looked very different from the other schemes we'd been pulled into.   They were part of Citigroup at the time, and they sold financial products like life insurance and mutual funds.  Their pitch was that they'd get you licensed to sell stuff like that, and that seemed tempting.  Yep, the course would cost money, and so would the test, but then you'd be off to a career that would make you a millionaire by age 30.

It set off my red flag sensor, because they ""hired"" all 15 people who were in the ""group interview"" with us.  I saw that most of the people in that room were not people I would hire, and knew something was fishy.  He couldn't be deterred, though, and signed up.   He still worked his day job, but he spent all his free time trying to recruit family members and sell stocks and life insurance to friends and family who were dirt poor.  Other than trying to recruit me every few months, we didn't talk about it much.

A year later I got him a great job working in a call center.  Yep, call center jobs suck, but compare that to cold calling people to sell them a pyramid scheme and it starts to look like a dream job.   He worked out well in the company, and had full health insurance.

He lasted 6 months, and then quit so he could work Primerica full time, because his upline told him the reason he wasn't succeeding was that he wasn't working enough hours.  These were the same people who rented Ferraris by the hour to show up at a potential client/employee's house to look rich, all while living in one bedroom apartments. 

Eventually Vance had to move in with his wife's parents (out of state) because he couldn't make rent on his own, and of course had no health insurance.   He stopped getting those preventative brain scans because he couldn't afford them -- *yet*.  He would have no problem paying for them just as soon as he ""built his company"", and was always saying that it was just a few months over the horizon.   

One day Vance suddenly couldn't get out of bed, and he was sick beyond sick.  His brain cancer had returned, and was at that point inoperable.  I saw him once before he died when he was on hospice care, and he could only stay awake for about 3 minutes.   I will never forget his funeral, where I watched his devastated wife - pregnant with their kid - being restrained by family members while she tried to stop the officiant from closing his casket for the last time.  That shit haunts me, man.  

He died of a tumor that likely was preventable had he kept his health insurance.  Instead, the bastards he worked for at Primerica convinced him to believe in a fake reality, a dream that even they would never achieve.

So Primerica is particularly evil, because it looks like legitimate work.   It has a cult culture that thrives on looking successful, and it can fool even brilliant people who should know better into selling everything they own at a shot to be rich.  A shot that will never happen.

Around that time, he gave an interview saying he did not want any public attention, and after the interview he would no longer comment publicly about Bitcoin or his role in it ""ever"".  4 years later he is non-stop giving speeches and making videos loudly proclaiming he is Satoshi, but still without signing a message from a known SN block.

While not outside the realm of possibilities, definitely not likely to happen anytime soon.

If this were to happen. The sad truth is that it would create a new system of inequality. This would be based on technological awareness. Those that are risk takers and technologically sound would be the new economy leaders.

SarangNoether,"It's time for my monthly research report for June. As always, my thanks to the community for ongoing support of research in applied cryptography.

Research this month focused primarily on major updates to the CLSAG security model, proofs, and preprint in response to initial results from the ongoing review; as well as work on an analysis toolkit for obtaining useful data from the blockchain.

The [CLSAG](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/654) linkable ring signature construction is currently undergoing [formal review](https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/ccs-proposals/-/merge_requests/150) by [JP Aumasson](https://aumasson.jp/) and [Antony Vennard](https://diagprov.ch/). The review is being conducted in two stages: the first to assert the correctness and applicability of the underlying mathematics and security model presented in the preprint, and the second to examine the implementation code for correctness and robustness. The reviewers found no major issues with the preprint, finding that the mathematics are correct and the security model reasonable. However, they made many suggestions for minor corrections and changes, as well as requested that some of the proofs be expanded for clarity. In particular, the proof that non-slanderability and unforgeability are equivalent has been entirely rewritten. Further, one of the cryptographic hardness assumptions has been reverted to another from an earlier draft with minor modifications. Finally, I completely overhauled and rewrote the proof of linkable anonymity security. Once the reviewers complete the second stage of the review process, they will release a final report that will be posted publicly. In the meantime, the reviewers and I have been discussing some of the specifics of their initial draft report. The revised preprint will be posted to the [IACR archive](https://eprint.iacr.org/) after additional review.

After reading a [preprint](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/593) that looked at deducible transactions and related statistics from the Monero blockchain, I decided to independently verify the results. This grew into a [Python toolkit](https://github.com/SarangNoether/skunkworks/tree/tracing) that can be used to extract block, transaction, input, and output data from local block explorers for analysis. The results have been useful; in particular, the analysis showed that while a nonzero number of recent transactions are deducible (that is, they are susceptible to so-called chain reaction analysis), all such transactions spend old funds generated prior to the confidential transaction protocol upgrade. Indeed, precisely zero confidential transactions are deducible. This analysis led to ongoing discussion with the preprint authors, who confirmed the results and are making further updates to their work; several of their conclusions are rendered incorrect by this transaction classification.

The analysis toolkit was also used to analyze spend age patterns. Early [work](https://maltemoeser.de/paper/monerolink.pdf) by Andrew Miller and collaborators examined these patterns in deducible Monero transactions and on the Bitcoin blockchain; their work led to the implementation of updated output selection algorithms. My updated analysis further examined whether coinbase outputs follow the same distribution, and how the distribution changed over time among deducible transactions. Results indicate that while there is variation over time, the spend age distribution reasonably matches the output selection distribution used by default, and that coinbase outputs follow the same distribution very closely. Ongoing work is in progress to conduct additional analysis using the toolkit.

On an unrelated note, I delivered a presentation to a cryptography study group held by [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/en/) at the group's invitation. This was a great opportunity to give an overview of how cryptographic constructions and building blocks are used to produce privacy-focused transaction protocols.

And now on to Sarang's Reading Corner, a short listing of some interesting papers that I have come across this month. The appearance of a paper in this list does not mean that I necessarily agree with its contents or correctness, or that I endorse it. Papers are in no particular order.

Leading_Zeros,"All fiat currencies fail, they are a stop-gap solution at best. Pretending money has a value whilst printing trillions out of thin air and expecting no consequences is how you find yourself on the wrong side of history. 50 cases of hyperinflation over the last 100 years of fiat currencies should be more than enough to convince anyone the idiocy of fiat, yet we continue to practice the fallacy of money can grow on trees instead of returning to hard currency like the other 4900 out of the last 5000 years.

Bitcoin is the hardest form of money ever invented. The most resilient robust piece of computer engineering on the planet. Blocks will continue to arrive roughly every 10 mins forever. 21 million supply is non-negotiable. All human made institutions come to an end, I know where I'd prefer to keep my savings.

I’ve had boosts here and there (including finding info to access a bitcoin wallet I thought I had lost in 2011 containing a handful of full btc.) The extra income from the pandemic unemployment certainly helped, as it ended up being close to a grand more a month than I was making previously, and I was doing just fine before the unemployment boost, so I just invested that as well.

fully_completely,"**Full, long** detailed summary:

Morgan says there will be 2-3 parts of this tell-all.

**July 1st 2020:**

\- Says it is really difficult when you’re with an abusive person and that their goal is to control you and isolate you from you friends, that they make you feel like they’re the only person there for you and like you are codependent. Her friends and family pulled her aside within 6 months to say they were worried about her and they’ve seen a change in her and she disregarded it and Evan told her that they were jealous and they all sucked.

\- Says she felt guilty when her mom and her friends called. Felt guilty if she hung out with anyone but Evan.

\- Says she was distanced from her friends and family, Evan would question her while she was on the phone even though she was talking to them right in front of him. Accused her of talking about him.

\- She says he manipulates any situation to fit his narrative.

\- Rachel from first season said that Evan was gaslighting her during their season, Morgan sided with Evan back then and felt bad.

**Sometime April 2020:** Here the video splits to different time/video where she is very emotional and crying. 

\- Says it was all real for her and really fell in love. Was scared to say anything because she knew how Evan would manipulate the situation

\- Says he is so good at making people feel sympathy for him. She still does it.

\- Said he was like this before his family tragedy, and that he has two brothers that aren’t pathological liars so that’s not the reason he’s like this. Called him a master manipulator. Gave an example, said she was making dinner, cutting vegetables and her friend and Evan were making fun of her saying she was going to cut her hand. She did in that moment, everyone was laughing, Evan was being SO sweet. It was a funny and cute memory for her. Turns out he told his and some of her friends that she cut her hand on purpose, blamed him and said she spread the blood on him. Said things like this happened often, daily. Would turn things around to where she would feel bad for him.

\- Evan bragged on the show about his accomplishments, trust funds, businesses (restaurants in LA, Hawaii), travelling, having millions in bitcoin. She told him he didn’t need to brag about these things, he said his family needs him and Kaci steals from him all the time and only wants handbags. This is where she fell in love with him. They were all lies.

\- Covered why she took care of him financially. Said she had signs. When they got back he said Kaci stole all his money and shut off his phone. Morgan says here that Kaci supported him for their entire relationship. Morgan paid for everything at that point. Says he told her that he would pay her back when he got the trust fund. He was supposed to get it in 2020. He broke up with her Dec 27th which was days before he would have gotten his trust fund.

\- She is crying here, implies she was broken when he left her. Things were good until they got so serious that his lies were bound to come out.

\- Evans moms called Morgans mom. Convo was normal, her mom told his mom that he was sad because he was under so much pressure because his mom and 2 brothers keep asking for money. She was all “whoa whoa whoa” and said it was all lies.

\- Morgan talked to his mom and his mom begged her not to leave him. Morgan wasn’t even considering it at this point. His mom told her that he had a problem lying since he was younger. The mom told her she was the only one who could help him and change him.

**OVERALL SUMMARY OF HIS LIES:**

* he owns 3 mansions that he allows his mother and 2 brothers to live on for free while he was in LA. Said his mother was irresponsible with money
* Owned a restaurant chain in Hawaii, and a restaurant in LA
* 3 Million dollars in Bitcoin
* 3 Million dollars in a trust fund his dad left for him
* Graduated College and was the star of basketball team
* The guys from their season thought Evan was a millionaire until she told them all
* Lives in a high rise in LA",fwrhlr6,2020-07-03 10:58:43,16

IllList3,"&gt;We're not against the fee revenue being high... We're against transaction fees for individual transactions being high. What you're saying doesn't make sense

That's what I said.  When individual transaction, median fees were at the same level with Bitcoin, bch proponents mocked it.  Free pass for ethereum though.

&gt;The bitinfocharts stats disagree

They disagree with the cost and speed of a LN transaction?

&gt;and the size of the blockchain is irrelevant to this debate

No, its entirely relevant.  Its a hidden cost and.its how ethereum is able to provide ""cheap"" transactions - by pushing that cost onto full nodes.

&gt;So it's either not trusting a websites with objective stats, or taking your (biased) word for it. We're talking about transaction fee revenue, and the 4.5 TB size is irrelevant to that.

Se above.

&gt;Yes, because LN isn't what's being measured

Then you're ignoring a huge part of the scaling methodology for Bitcoin.  This conversation and any maths based stats are entirely irrelevant. 

&gt;We're specifically talking about fee revenue on-chain.

No, you are, not we.

&gt;One could argue the same for Ethereum since they already have L2 solutions too, so your point has no merit.

So include them.

By pushing extra cost onto full nodes.",fww46wx,2020-07-04 19:25:01,1

Btcyoda,"I my mind this period, before the next run, will probably be looked back at as the last chance a average person could still 'easily' get one whole Bitcoin.
When pushed several Bitcoins would have been possible.

After next bull run we probably see the lows of some $10-20k.
Could be some less could be some more, if financial markets start dying it could be we see a real dip again, could also mean we will never see those low prices again...

Those prices, $10-20k, would mean an average guy would have to pour in most of his savings at once at such a dip to be able to get one whole coin.

But for most their mental barrier, ""I missed out"" will be the biggest problem to get any significant amount, until they again mentally surrender and buy in, forced, at even higher prices.

It's not what I want to happen or that I don't want them to get Bitcoin,  it's just how these psychological things work (on an average).

Blockstream kicking Gavin, the lead Bitcoin developer, out of Bitcoin development, successfully hijacked control over the Bitcoin github.

Mike Hearn and Gavin wanted to prevent Bitcoin from being hijacked, so they created a fork. That fork didn't survived after they were heavily DDOS. Mike Hearn was heavily character assassinated by what I believe to be orchestrated paid campaigns by Blockstream. And of course, now that Mike Hearn is gone, the character assassination campaigns are directed at Bitcoin Cash main supporters like Roger Ver.

I was involved in some BCH projects and there had been multiple DDOS attacks and other stuff, such as flooding my inbox with few hundred thousand emails per day. I'm sure those activities are not for profit, so why are they doing it?

There are actually plenty more nasty unethical things BTC people had done which is not covered in this comment. Bitcoin Cash is an attempt to rescue what the bad actors had hijacked successfully, mainly the peer to peer cash revolution. And it won't be the last time the bad actors will try to find ways to sabotage this project.

Kumomax1911,"There is actually a monetary incentive to vote for smaller pools, but the problem being solved is much larger than you've envisioned and the problem were left with is much smaller than Bitcoin.

Binance can and will open as many pools as would be most profitable for them. Voting on each pool will reach a saturation point of profit and Binance should should easily have enough ADA to hit that balance. Let's say they need 3 pools to maximize their staking. Now Binance controls 4 out of 50 pools,100 pools, 200 pools? Remember, less than half a dozen pools have 50% control over Bitcoin. Around 6 entities have obtained a controllable amount of network authority the last time I checked. 

Meanwhile, Binance can't come close to controlling 50% of the Cardano chain. The reason is because it would cost too much to own 51% of all pools while their ""votes"" are best used on themselves and can't be shared. This is what broke EOS, and why EOS is only a couple simple steps away from working governance. Every vote on EOS is actually capable of being shared with 28 friends. Huobi, Binance, Newdex and all the other exchanges running as EOS ""pools"" would unlikely make any governance change that would destroy their vote sharing and selling. They then would lose their monetary control.

The slow pace of Cardano development is clearly going to be rewarded by breaking the ""You scratch my back and I'll scratch your back"" agreements between pools, but are exchanges still voting for themselves going to be secure enough to protect the network? Well, It works for Bitcoin and not everyone can make pools or meaningfuly vote on the Bitcoin network.

Every miner running a Bitcoin  farm is a vote for themselves. Unfortunately, for Bitcoin you now only have inventive to mine with expensive and specialized hardware that's unattainable by the average person. Furthermore, the hardware is all produced in China. Does that seem very decentralized? Yet, it still works. The reason it still works is because voting for yourself means you will also need skin in the game. The point here is to make sure Binance has increased skin in the game for each unit of authority they obtain, they do not have value to buy 51% of all running pools (The ADA coin price would increase too much), and ensure they can't share/sell that authority with their associates. 

It seems cardano is accomplishing all of the above with their structure of pools, but can it be more decentralized? Likely. Creating locked voting would help. The longer your willing to lock your stake, by voting, the more your vote is actually worth. This could mean that the average holder has the option of being heard as loud as larger holders if they're willing to lock their ADA for long periods of time. An option bad acting exchanges could never choose with their customers funds because they need their ADA to stay much more liquid. 

So no.. Cardano hasn't allowed everyone an equal slice of it's authority. Though, it's still provides one of the best playing fields for fairness while keeping the network secure. Besides, some would argue that you always deserve a little more authority when you have more skin to lose.",fwwqt2j,2020-07-05 00:15:36,1

MostBoringStan,"If they are asking for YOUR wallet address, it's probably so they can tell which incoming payment belongs to you. I don't use Binance, but I don't think it will be possible for you to pay directly from them because you usually don't know where your payment is coming from if you are using an exchange.

Just get yourself a free wallet, withdraw from Binance to that wallet, and make the payment from there. I don't use a free wallet so I can't suggest one to you, just make sure to do your research so you get a legit one.

When you have your wallet there should be an option to receive bitcoin, click that and it will give you an address. When you click withdraw on Binance, it will want an address to send to. Use your receiving address for that.

Now when you want to pay the vendor from your personal wallet, you send it to the address that they provided you, and where they want your address, give them the one you received Bitcoin on, the same one you provided to Binance to withdraw to.

It might seem complicated all spelled out, but it's really not. Just go slow and don't rush anything. Get the hang of it and feel free to ask questions if you get stuck. There are no stupid questions when you are making sure your money is safe.",fwxe6mt,2020-07-05 03:43:15,1

Yeah, tweeting all day long on Twitter about roadmaps, partnerships is innovation all right.   
Bitcoin's plans are well known. 21 million total coins, that's it.   
Channels are mentioned in Whitepaper, so advanced constructs are allowed by protocols in second layer. That will continue to happen. Thing is, there is no pre-miner who wants to sell you his bags, so there is no one promoting bitcoin.   


But altcoin pre-miners spend all day on twitter/reddit etc, luring in their victims. So you think they are the great innovators. Keep thinking that, and lose money.",fwxfh1a,2020-07-05 03:54:59,1

rattie_ok,"Well, first, I'll be in my late 60s. My family tree is packed full of cancer, manic depression (suicide), and alcoholism. The probability of dying before 2050 is pretty high.

Second, look at the way the world is going. Polar caps are melting; new diseases happen every decade or so; crony capitalism is ruining people's bodies souls. There will be billions of people migrating from extreme climates, consider the crime and public unrest skyrocketing. AI and Robotics will take over all ""regular"" jobs, and I can bet my life that no government will allow free lunch (livable basic income) to exist. With ever-dwindling resources and inability to find and colonize other habitable planets, or build space habitats, the coming class warfare will push up the pressure cooker to tipping point.

Third, even if I somehow manage to survive to 2050, not kill myself because everything goes to shit, or be killed because I have $1 or 100 satoshi more than the other guy, then, what guarantees me that Bitcoin or any kind of cryptocurrency will still be around half a century later?

dcwj,"To preface the rest of this comment: my perspective is very biased. I’m quite comfortable with taking high-risk bets on future technologies, and being an “innovator” (the segment of customer that comes even before “early adopter”), so my perspective is definitely a very optimistic one, and I could be way off base with this. (But on the other hand, I *am* quoted in a book about blockchains by an author who predicted smartphones, so I might have *some* sense in this area...sorry for the not-so-humble brag.)

I’m from Toronto and living in Vancouver right now. I’ve only got one hotspot at the moment, but it’s earning roughly 100 USD per month so far. For the first few weeks, it was just in my apartment and wasn’t close enough to any other hotspots in the city to participate in or witness challenges, so it was essentially operating solo. During that period, it was earning about 6 or 7 HNT per day. I recently moved it to a friend's apartment where it's closer to a couple other hotspots, and now it's earning closer to 10 HNT per day.

Right now, HNT is going for about .45 USD, and I’ve seen other people say that 6 or 7 HNT is pretty standard for a hotspot in an area without anything else around it. I think even assuming the token price and the earnings per-hotspot stay within similar ranges to where they are today, the proposition already seems worth it to me, especially considering that you don't really have to do any work other than plugging it in and leaving in on a windowsill.

On a spectrum from pessimistic to neutral to optimistic, that's somewhere between neutral and pessimistic, and it's already a pretty solid proposition: it should pay for itself in roughly 6 months, assuming the per-hotspot earnings don't drop too drastically as new ones come online.

And when I start to daydream a bit about where this project could go on the optimistic side is when I start getting really excited. What happens to the token price if Bitcoin goes on another bull run and brings a lot of mainstream attention to the crypto space? Or when it starts getting listed on some of the big name crypto exchanges and more crypto investors start speculating on it? (Especially once some of the ""crypto influencers"" start hyping up how it's an IoT company from the inventor of Napster, and backed by high profile investors like Google Ventures! There aren't a lot of projects in the crypto space that can claim that kind of legitimacy.)

Also, if the Helium network captures a significant chunk of IoT demand, that'll put positive pressure on the HNT price, since Data Credits can only be created by burning HNT.

And any increases in token price aside, the idea of having multiple hotspots covering one area (and maybe even forming a consensus group) is still really exciting, since once they've paid for themselves, everything on top is gravy. I have a few more on order to put around Vancouver, and a couple ordered to put at a few friends' places in Toronto (East York).

I think it'll quickly become a game of real estate where people will be racing to own the future IoT earnings potential of the 300 metres surrounding well-positioned windowsills (since hotspots need to be 300m apart).

I personally think if you can afford it, it's worth taking a risk on it right now. We're still in the period before the opportunity becomes obvious. I've seen people in the community Slack channel say that participating in this community gives them a similar feeling to participating in the Bitcoin community in the early days (back when people used to say ""Yeah cool, but it's not really worth anything."")

I personally am looking at it as a hobby project that may or may not pay itself off. Getting involved in IoT technology is pretty exciting to me even if Helium doesn't become ""the next Bitcoin"" or anything. (I even bought a domain and started working on [a side project](https://helium.plus) related to Helium).

I know it can be hard to take crypto projects seriously after the euphoria and delusion of 2017, but I think Helium will be to the ICO implosion as Amazon was to the dot com crash. (And Brave will be the Google, but that's for another discussion.)",fwy6ywp,2020-07-05 08:21:36,1

VegetableEar,"I don't know if people complaining about it = it's not working, if anything it shows it is causing problems to that style of gameplay.  Either they are running a few pieces of gear so they can secure a scav kill, or they aren't playing.  I wouldn't exactly call those games hardcore either, but yes I agree Tarkov isn't exactly all that punishing.    


I think people have it backwards, you cannot expect to be succesfull if you have severe gear fear.  Not running that kit except for a special occasion is probably hindering people more than they know.  People who loot run are equally being selfish, just in a different way and spout the ""let me play how I want to play"" as a justification for doing something the devs are actively trying to undermine and remove.    


Yes I did say I was salty about it.  I don't care about people taking loot or money out, I care about people effectively wasting server slots to play solo.  These are the same people who add me and call me a piece of shit for killing them.  Because their experience is one that is completely seperate from the multiplayer aspect of the game.    


I would put money on people not running loadouts being far more rooted in fear of losing money than of actually being able to run kits.  There is probably a very small percentage who are running a sub 10% survival rate and cannot for the life of them make money and resort to loot runs.  Either they are new and this will pass, or the game just isn't for them/they need to practice in a different way.  But these are probably as much an outlier as a popular streamer or people similar in ability etc.    


Because it's a format designed to be played against other players, otherwise it wouldn't be online with 4-14 people on a server all able to kill eachother.  I don't see how people are so defensive over every server having multiple people just running in and out as quickly as possible without gear or with just a pistol and see it as a positive aspect of the game.  Entire front page of this subreddit is just people whinging about every tiny change to their ability to do this, saying bitcoin is useless, this is impossible etc etc.  And they are endlessly wrong, they are just playing the game in a way that makes it harder for themselves to even survive against a piss weak AI scav.    


The devs would like players stay in raids for longer and kill loot running regardless.",fx2u7oc,2020-07-06 16:27:21,1

Everytime I passed a certain amount of cash on hand (5 mill when I started out) I used the surplus money to buy graphics cards. I had the bitcoin farm up at 35 graphics cards in 3 weeks. And I didnt need more. I could collect 2-3 bitcoins every time I checked. Equalling 300-450k income. And from there the money just went up. I never lost money after reaching 35 graphics card, and I didnt see the need to max out graphics card on it.

Now things have changed since last wipe. For example you could sell empty 2x2 fuel canisters and buy them again at about the same price (= free fuel).

behindtext,"&gt; The arrogance to claim Decred ""can't be forked"".

the senior devs and myself have never once claimed Decred cannot be forked. if this claim is being made, it would be helpful to know who is making it and where. the intent of our consensus change system is to make it very expensive to maintain a minority fork, not to make it impossible, per the [blog entry on the consensus change system from November 2016](https://blog.decred.org/2016/11/16/Upgrading-Consensus/).

&gt; And Company Zero centralization is (part of?) why Coinbase's lawyers put the kibosh on listing DCR.

this is outright FUD and is incorrect.

&gt; Decred's C-level executives never miss a chance to purity spiral

anyone who pays any attention to the project knows we have no ""C-level executives"", so this is more FUD.

&gt; The excruciating, sluggish-to-glacial pace of development.

we have more dev deliverables between the work before launch and since than most projects valued in Bs of USD. whether anyone pays attention to this work is clearly another matter. projects like Cardano have taken years to deliver working PoS (is it even live on mainnet?) and Ethereum has been talking about it for 6 years now with no delivery in sight.

&gt; I've always known btcd/btcdsuite is c0's bill-paying day job and DCR is more of a hobby vanity project built in the garage on slow weekends.

this is not even close to correct. btcsuite never generated any revenue for Conformal Systems or Company 0, which is precisely why we created Decred: there is a massive tragedy of the commons in the Bitcoin dev space. all work performed by CS and C0 has been bankrolled by me, personally, apart from contractor pay from the treasury. work slowed on btcsuite throughout 2014-2016 and completely stopped by late 2016, and the project is currently maintained by Lightning Labs and has been since 2017.  C0 spends the majority of its time working on Decred and has since early 2016.

if your claim that you've been here since launch is true, you're probably one of the most misinformed people i've ever interacted with. what strikes me as far more probable is that you're here to spread FUD.

if you don't like the way the project has been going, you're always welcome to exit your position, but showing up here and spreading what i'm pretty certain is disinformation is not going to help the project. we can't be held responsible for the extent to which you are mis/dis-informed.",fx3j2j6,2020-07-06 22:38:33,1

Amount of money you want to make / VET you hold = Target VET price

speculated bitcoin value / speculated future vet price = target price in Sats

Circulating supply of VET * VET price = current or speculative VET market cap (value of all coins)

Current VET market cap / Market cap of all crypto = VET market share (use this to speculate on both the price increasing and the usage of VET increasing relative to other cryptos).

Future VET selling price / the cost basis of your investment = ""multiple"" on your money

Multiple on your money - 1 = % capital gain or loss

1 - (Your wallet ranking/Total wallets) = Your percentile placement among all holders.

The lack of price action (bart) to me is something good - as it stabilizes price action (the bbands and volatility). Bitcoin being Bitcoin, doesn't like it. It's like trying to keep a kitten inside a pen for a long time, after a while it'll figure its way out.

That movement out of this 9k-10k is what the entire trading community is waiting for. So yes, I do think something is going to happen to get us above or below.

The majority of sentiment that I've seen is that if it goes down, it'll follow fib levels as low as $6000something, to something above $10500.

If it breaks $8800, I expect a lot of traders to buy the dip, and investors to buy as well. The further the dip, the more action as people scoop up bitcoin at a ""discount"", with the sentiment being ""anything below $10k is good in the long term"".

If it breaks $10500, you'll see FOMO hit and people jump in resulting in a wild ride.

The elephant in the room is the Fed - specifically liquidity/inflation/etc... 

Personally, I think we're going to see higher highs in the equities markets since Trump wants to get reelected, and after the recession I feel like the crash will happen.

Shortly after Blockstream was [incorporated](https://archive.is/qzsVe), they received [$50 million](https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/blockstream-series-unknown--66d2817a#section-investors) in venture capital from AXA, Khosla Ventures, Horizon Ventures, etc., some of the most powerful venture firms in the world. The [Blockstream board of directors](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7kflur/anybody_ever_find_anything_interesting_in_these/dre1508/) are all bankers.

In the Summer of 2015, all of the primary Bitcoin communities such as /r/Bitcoin, mailing lists, Bitcoin Talk, wikis, etc., began [massive censorship campaigns](https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43) against any and all topics that had to do with scaling Bitcoin beyond the 1MB limit which, by the way, was temporarily added by Satoshi Nakamoto back in 2010 as a stop-gap measure to prevent spam in the early days.

The Bitcoin name and repository were hijacked by a for-profit organisation so they could make a buck on their own patented and convoluted ""solution"" for a problem that doen't even exist (in fact; they themselves created it). In this process, Bitcoin (BTC) was turned into an altcoin by implementing SegWit (the coin itself is no longer a “chain of digital signatures,” as per Fig. 1 of the white paper).

Luckily, Bitcoin as described in the whitepaper by it's inventor Satoshi Nakamoto continues to exist under the name Bitcoin Cash before BTC forked off with SegWit. It uses the superior scaling solution as described by Satoshi and keeps all transactions Peer-to-Peer on the blockchain.

TLDR: [Blockstream fucked Bitcoin over](https://youtu.be/jctc85X_PCI?t=79) and r/Bitcoin bans people talking about it.

Excal2,"&gt;What is it about crypto that puts people at odds like this?

Basically the people at the top  of the crypto pyramid, for years, pumped and dumped bitcoin alternately with other cryptocurrencies. I've heard them referred  to as  ""seasons"" as in ""it's bitcoin season"" which means bitcoin is getting juiced before a massive sell off and reinvestment into an alt-coin like Monero. The alt-coin of choice would change season to season, but a given alt-coin's community would take their pump season as evidence that they were superior to all other alt-coins.

""One coin to rule them all"" kind of thinking, because if you were in on the right coin that managed to survive long term (this never happened because once the  pump was done all the money was moved back to the now reduced-price bitcoin) then you'd be  one of the next cryptocurrency millionaires that totally exist all over the place and it's so easy dude your computer does all the work why would you *not* be doing this?!

The people at the bottom of the pyramid thus became very  competitive  and political with one another based on what season it was and what coins were doing well, this was especially prevalent for  communities whose coins managed to kinda survive the dump at the end of a season and become actually self-sustaining  for a period of time like Monero.

soforth,"As someone who witnessed the blocksize ~~debate~~ wars, it's very hard to be pro-BTC. The narrative was manipulated through blatant and unrelenting censorship to justify not raising the blocksize, which had been planned all along. From my perspective, almost the entire OG Bitcoin community was for raising the blocksize, with the exception of blockstream, theymos, and their army of maximalist trolls (mostly paid shills, sock puppets, and new users without enough context to see through the r/Bitcoin propaganda).

As a result of the takeover, merchant acceptance of BTC - which had been growing quickly in 2014/2015 - reversed completely. Any other use cases, e.g. colored coins, smart contracts etc, were suddenly dead in the water. I didn't see anyone pushing the SoV narrative prior to the split. It was clear to all of us that value derives from utility, most of which has now been destroyed.

Eventually that reality will catch up with BTC. I can only hope ETH is not a victim of collateral damage.

texfilmguy,"This was the first sentence in the introduction of the plaintiffs filings. 


“In a scheme to raise hundreds of millions of dollars defendants illegally sold useless XRP tokens to retail investors around the globe.”

Is it just me or does that just sound off?  And reaching?  

“Useless XRP”. It just looks like a smear from the start, rife with agenda. 

But even with setting that aside, the fundamental argument which they are presenting right there, which is to say XRP is useless...

 (word choice is funny sometimes... they say ‘useless’ instead of ‘worthless’)

...XRP as it stands today is being used right now in actual production contracts across The world for remittances. 

Being used now. Today. Not useless. But actually being used for it’s created purpose. Not a security but a bridge asset that can source liquidity on demand when and where people need it. 

I keep seeing all of these posts... these quick little quips of ‘I don’t know any better’... XRP isn’t blockchain. 

Well... what is a block chain? What is it’s purpose? 

It is a distributed ledger. 

A record of transaction that doesn’t fall under one jurisdiction or one central control system. It is global and pretty much anyone can join. 

(Don’t split hairs with me here yes there is more to the description but what are we using it for really? To have an immutable record. One That is trustless and can be unchallenged. That is a powerful tool and there are a few ways of going about achieving that. Bitcoin does it by a Proof of work system. Etheruem is POW but is supposed to flip to Proof of stake any day now... will you say that ETH is not blockchain after the switch?  XRP achieves the same outcome with a method called consensus. So you can call it just a fancy Excel spreadsheet if you want but I would say that the same label could hit Bitcoin.  It’s a ledger. A record of transaction. That’s what this thing is.)

Ripple as a node operator lost a majority control to its network some time ago and the validators on the network, which behave like miners essentially for bitcoins blockchain, but for XRP, have recently passed rules that Ripple itself has no control over. 

Ripple is not centralized. Yes they have a lot of XRP in lockup. But tell me how that’s any different from Satoshi holding 1 million bitcoin in his/her/their wallet? 

At least we know who is in charge of that stash of XRP. 

And for anyone saying on the first of every month “Ripple DUMPS another BILLION XRP on the market....”

Just do your research. There is an escrow that releases to ripple 1 Billion XRP every month. Ripple has been sending most of it back into lockup for a while now. They take a little for their own purposes and send most of it back. 

At this point I still don’t see what the debate is. Bitcoin was positioned to be a payments network but we all know that it cannot handle that process. 

But hey... in a world where diamonds, Art, Jewelry, Baseball cards... and on and on can have value for its scarcity.... so then BTC can have its place and it works better than trying to move a piece of Art. 

When it comes to enterprise needs however... speed is key. 

XRP has a limited supply just like Bitcoin. It will actually reduce in supply over time.... and so it has scarcity. There will be no more XRP created. 

XRP is a “green currency” as in its power needs are minuscule. 

Bitcoin is a power hungry machine. 

And XRP can settle and be transferred in 3-5 seconds. 

Bitcoin takes HOURS at times to settle. 

So what’s the debate?  

XRP is faster. XRP is cheaper to use. XRP has a limited supply. XRP is regulatory compliant around the globe. (The US will get there). 

So again... I ask. What is the debate. 

Let Bitcoin go to $500,000 if that’s where people think it can go. I own some Bitcoin so that’s good for me. I think there is space in the world for both. 

But don’t tell me XRP is useless. These lawsuits are ridiculous. 

And also if you know your history about ripple they were already approached and FINED by FINCEN. Years ago when it looked like things might be questionable they were set right by the governing bodies. 

I just don’t like misinformation and blatant lies. There are a lot of people here that are trying to better themselves, especially in these times and when people outright just create false narratives it really bugs me. 

Tribalism is not the way and anyone that calls themselves a “Maximilast” when it comes to their token of choice... get off your high horse. We all need each other to get behind solid projects. 

If there is a real solution for a real problem then we all need to get behind those projects. They will make all of our lives better. 

Ripple as a company is doing a lot of good for the cryptosphere and the haters need to really understand those efforts. 

Put down your rocks people and start helping.

jtoomim,"&gt; Some of these other options are:

&gt;    (2) Bounded [sic] mining

Bonded mining is a bad idea. At a fundamental level, bonded mining is a workaround for a broken DAA. It's much better to *fix the bug* than to add a workaround on top of the bug while leaving the bug still in place.

Bonded mining is a bad idea for many reasons. Here's a few:

1. It's very complicated. It's about 10x as much code and as much work as simply fixing the DAA would be. Nobody has written that code yet. Nobody knows what it would look like. But it's a reasonable guess that it will be ugly.

2. it simply does not work with low-hashrate miners. The algorithm proposed in the bonded mining paper requires each miner to comprise at least 1% of the hashrate in order to have a decent success rate. This contribute to mining pool centralization. The Bonded Mining paper excuses this by saying: ""Smaller miners do not need to be excluded from the system as they can join a larger pool."" That's not a good excuse. Pool centralization is itself the problem.

3. It compromises the ability of miners to remain anonymous. By tying miners to their bonds, miners need to have all of their blocks be linked together. Basically, it forces address reuse. This compromises the censorship-resistance properties of Bitcoin, and makes miners more vulnerable to reprisal, such as in the event of World War 3.

jtoomim,"Here's what you said:

&gt; Recently, Jonathan Toomim has written a detailed proposal for addressing a significant issue on Bitcoin Cash. That issue has been that ""benevolent"" miners are losing money relative to profit seeking miners.

Most reasonable readers will see this context, and assume that you are accurately summarizing my article. Your use of quotes in the context of summarizing my article will usually be interpreted as a direct quote. 

With or without quotes, this ""benevolent"" word is a problem. My article *did not describe them this way* -- it only mentioned ""steady,"" ""consistent,"" or ""constant"" hashrate, and did not ascribe motivations to these miners.

Please don't misquote other people. Don't mischaracterize their arguments. Be charitable and accurate when restating the position you're arguing against.

&gt; I put benevolent in quotes because it is the euphemism that has been being used to describe the behavior.

A less ambiguous way to indicate its euphemistic nature would be to prepend the word ""supposedly."" A better strategy would be to not use the word ""benevolent"" at all.

&gt; And this kind of failure to assume good faith is exactly why these discussions always turn into a shitstorm.

nullc,"I don't think that it does for a very specific reason:

Most of the ICO's you see exist for a specific non-obvious purpose.  There fewer than 7000 or so people who bought the initially sold coins from the 72 million coin ethereum premine, and half of that  amount went to under 100 parties.

These ultra massive positions are illiquid: They can't exchange their positions for positions with long term value without crushing the ethereum price, perhaps irrevocably. 

So, they sponsor all these ICOs, many of which are extremely sketchy or outright fraud in order to get additional suckers in and get them locked up for various periods in order to unwind their positions (or otherwise extract value from them) without collapsing the price.

A key point there is that the people propping up these ICOs are losing tremendous amounts of money *on paper* in order to do so, but they get real value out.   

So imagine you own a million ETH.  If you sold quickly on the market you'd collapse the ethereum price.  Instead, you seed and sponsor a bunch of ICOs and irrecoverably spend two hundred thousand of your ethereum on assets you know will almost certainly be worthless... but as a result you drive hype that allows you to exit the other 8 hundred thousand of your premined coins for a much better return than if you'd tried to sell the whole amount directly at once.  

It's analogous to money laundering:  In money laundering you use dirty money to prop up a failing business with fake activity in order to give a legitimate origin to them.  In doing so, you might lose half your money-- because the business costs money to operate--, but the money was worthless to you without the laundering because you couldn't spend it without getting caught so its still a good deal-- if you're laundering money.  The business is a bad deal if you're trying to operate it as a legitimate business.

Imagine you move into some small town find find that there were 47 large car washes operating there and you get your hands on their books and see that they're all generating a HUGE amount of business.  You might think ""Wow! Car washes are a big deal here! I want in!"" -- but then you open your car wash and find that the business is a complete bust.  There wasn't really demand for even two car washes, much less 47... and the 47 front car washes more than handled all the real business.  You went into the car wash business by [imitating their appearance without understanding the real business motivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult), and failed as a result.

So it doesn't matter if Liquid provides an equivalent or even better issuance platform because for the most part there is zero or nearly zero interest in buying these ""issued assets"" except as a result of the largely dishonest hype which was only generated to help make a market to offload eth holdings.

The situation isn't the same for Bitcoin-- Bitcoin was utterly premineless and for the most part didn't end up with the same asset distribution and people are much more substantially in it for the long run.  To the extent that long time Bitcoin holders needed to generate hype to unwind their positions they have historically been able to do it using Bitcoin itself and later by using the altcoin hype (for a long time the only way to buy most altcoins was by going through Bitcoin).

This is also why you've seen all manner of other fringe altcoins with all kinds of asset functionality go totally unused.  The people creating them have fundamentally misunderstood the market demand.

So sure, to the extent that there is a legitimate interest in issuing assets liquid might be a useful replacement for much of it (particularly because these assets themselves are centralized so a federated system to track them isn't a security downgrade)... but I think the level of real interest there is pretty limited -- mostly just 'stable coins' that don't have any speculative value themselves.

Similarly, to the extent that there is market to sell potemkin dreams to suckers who don't require enough hype-spend to operate at a (paper) loss, that market has been largely tapped out by the initial ICO craze.  The most vulnerable marks have already been sucked dry.

Everything else is just a way to generate hype to unwind premine fuelled massive positions which don't exist in Bitcoin land.",fxs2muv,2020-07-12 09:59:59,13

UomoGonfiatoDiArgon,"La dura realtà che abbiamo appreso da piccoli è che Fujiko era una grandissima troia. Tutta la sua dote consisteva nelle esagerate poppe e nella grande abilità a prostituirsi. Poi trova Lupin III, che è un po' coglione, fa la profumiera e il coglione ci casca sempre e si fa pure fregare spesso.

È stata fortunata anche perché Jigen e Goemon sono pressoché asex e aromantici e pure sfortunati con le donne (non ditemi che non avete notato che il primo ha un fedora e il secondo una katana). Sono professionisti che fanno il lavoro sporco al posto di Lupin. Lupin non è bravo, è solo fortunato, ma la fortuna non basta: ci vuole qualcuno che faccia materialmente il lavoro. Jigen e Goemon ne cavano in cambio un po' di amicizia cameratesca e pure una percentuale, se il colpo va a buon fine e Fujiko non li frega, ma non si capisce bene quando avranno mai tempo di godersi quei soldi.

Infine c'è Zenigata, il vecchio rimbambito di cui i superiori assecondano la noiosa e inconcludente fissazione di un'intera vita.

Sono passati tanti anni e quindi Zenigata è da presumere morto di vecchiaia (chissà, magari le sue ultime parole in punto di morte saranno state ""Lu Peeen"") e gli altri personaggi invecchiati. Anche Jigen andrebbe presunto morto, viste le abitudini quanto a tabacco e alcool: muscoli, riflessi e mente invecchiano più rapidamente, sarà avvenuto sicuramente la prima volta che non è riuscito a concentrarsi abbastanza in fretta o a centrare un bersaglio al primo colpo. Probabilmente anche Lupin è morto allo stesso modo, anche lui di morte anonima, non affatto eroica o spettacolare, forse addirittura in un letto d'ospedale ignorato da tutti, come un infartuato durante il lockdown. Goemon invece ai primi segni di vecchiaia si sarà ritirato in un monastero shintoista, forse senza neanche un centesimo, ma giurerei che morirà più che centenario dopo tante, tante, tante meditazioni.

Nonostante Fujiko venga presentata come atletica e abilissima nelle arti marziali, il calendario le avrà presto presentato il conto, le poppe si saranno ridotte a due vecchie ciabatte, avrà messo su qualche chilo che non vuol proprio andare via, spenderà ore interminabili di trucco per sembrare una milfettona decente, e arrivata ai quaranta avrà deciso che bisogna fare urgentemente un figlio perché la menopausa è alle porte. Già è difficile trovare un buon maritino a quell'età (proprio lei che è specializzata in coglioni tipo Lupin), metteteci poi la depressione e l'ansia dovute all'essere ricercata dall'Interpol e a dover cambiare nome e residenza almeno una volta l'anno, più la non brillante gestione delle proprie finanze, ce la vedo suicida prima dei sessant'anni accanto a una bottiglia vuota di vodka da supermarket.

A me che mi identificavo con Goemon affettatutto resta un velo di tristezza per gli amici persi e il dolceamaro di tanti bei ricordi delle grandi avventure di quando avevamo salute e tanta voglia di fare e di quando la mia saggezza (""chi dice donna dice danno!"") non veniva ascoltata. Tutte le serie successive di Lupin hanno costruito nuove storie, tutte inventate e puramente scenografiche, hanno alterato il carattere dei personaggi per fare più audience e per adeguarsi ai tempi (Lupin sul dark web coi bitcoin), sbiadendo sempre più l'immagine originale di quell'imbattibile trio.

jstolfi,"According to that and other articles, some rightfully anonymous miners rented enough hashpower on Nicehash to gain a majority of the BTG hashing power, and on July 1st started mining a secret branch of the blockchain, presumably with the fraudulent reversal of some payment made after that date. 

This ""fix""  was made easier because BTG uses a modified proof-of-work formula that is supposed to be ""ASIC-resistant"", meaning that it cannot be easily accelerated by custom chips. With that, the creators hoped that mining would be limited to ordinary computers and hashing power would remain widely dispersed among thousands of small miners.

Well, that hope does not seem to have been realized...

The ""fixers"" released their secret branch on July 10, which by now had over 1300 blocks.  According to the basic principle of the bitcoin protocol, all BTG users should have immediately and automatically accepted the new branch as ""the"" true blockchain -- and thus any payment cancellations and redirections included in it.

The ""fix"" partly failed, however, because the head developer of BTG (CryproDG, alleged to be @AlejandroRegojo on Twitter) had posted a  release 0.17.2 on July 2, that (unbeknownst to all users, including the ""fixers"") established a new checkpoint for the blockchain. That is, the new release included a new rule:  

    block number 640650 must have the hash 
      ""000000059ec8884fa4fbbdbe46c09cfb4ecba281dfa2351a05084e817c1200ae""

which was a block of the non-secret chain, mined sometime after the ""fixers"" chain branched off.  

Thus, every BTG user who had upgraded to  0.17.2 (or applied a manual configuration patch with the same effect) rejected the ""fixers""' secret branch as invalid, even though it had more work than the ""unfixed"" branch. (Note that the illustration on the linked Coinspice article is wrong.)

Thus BTG users can rest assured, because the coin's Central Executive Officer will surely detect any similar attempted ""fixes"" in the future and will take similar prompt action to thwart them -- by informing everybody of which of multiple ""valid"" blockchains is the ""right"" one.  They can trust him.  If nothing else, because Vitalik Buterin, the CEO of Ethereum (which is itself transitioning from proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake scheme) fully approved his performance in this case. 

The only snag in this incident was that any BTG user who did not upgrade to 0.17.2 and did not know about the manual fix **did** switch to the ""fixers"" branch on July 10.   As they continued to use that branch, they may have experienced confusing responses, possibly including payment reversals and redirections, from those exchanges and users who eventually rejected it.   

However, there is no reason to expect that the losses of BTG users due to this hiccup will compare to those that they suffered in the three previous successful 51% ""fixes"", that netted 388,201 BTG (worth $17.5 million at that time), 1,900 BTG ($19,000), and 5,267 BTG ($53,000), respectively, to the respective ""fixers"".",fxuea10,2020-07-13 02:00:45,20

CC payment seem to work for 95% of people, if you had issues I could likely pinpoint the reasoning, but not during a live sale. You also had issues with bitcoin payment, this is the first time with the new extension on the site so there were a few bugs. Again I could likely help you pinpoint the issues, but not during a live event. I was messing around with the new bitcoin extension to see if its possible to send you another invoice, but I don't think that's an option.

&gt; Stan informs me that there isn’t a way for them to go into my invoice and have me remit payment.. but despite that fact he tells me that he actually re-sold the seeds I ordered and sent them out to another customer.. also since there is no inventory (which there should have been because I placed an order that should have taken those seeds out of their inventory count) I will have to wait until the store opens back up and place another order.. I guess I have to just cross my fingers and hope their website will accept my payment this next time?!? 

&amp;#x200B;

We didn't sell your seeds to another customer. You never successfully made a payment, therefor the inventory was never set aside for your order.

yeahdave4,"After four weekly red candles, it is very rare for BTC to have a 5th red candle.  Granted the red candles are small but (depending on which exchange you look at), 5 weekly red candles in a row hasn't happened for years.  A lot of people were betting that the 5th candle would be green (out of sheer odds).  Now that this 5th candle is indeed a small green candle, it will be easier to continue to have red candles (sounds silly but this is what a lot of people were looking at).

The correlation with the stock market is too strong to apply any independent projections/planning to crypto.  Things could look good (and they do look very good), but the stock market could reverse that at the drop of a hat.  Until there is independent demand and confidence in the crypto space I would suggest caution and patience.  The risk to reward is very poor in trying to catch a $242-$250 move.  This is magnified by the fact that there was little follow through with the ratio breaking above 0.026 and the low volume in general.  I am going to wait for confirmation and momentum.

As always, this applies to people making particular decisions right now and not to blind/automated cold accumulation.

Edit:

As a side note.  It seems Eth is no longer an altcoin in a lot of ways (from a trading/volatility perspective).  The question will be, will the ratio wither when Bitcoin makes a move or has that changed as well?  It will be interesting to watch and will be another sign that the market has begun

viajero_loco,"This is a very good and imho very accurate rehearsal and summary of the events that unfolded.


**One small but imho very important side note:**

ASICBoost is basically an attack on the SHA256 bitcoin mining algorithm. It allows taking a shortcut via version rolling and was discovered **and patented** by Timo Hanke and RSK designer [Sergio Lerner](https://twitter.com/sdlerner).

This was the big fuck-up that set the stage for all the drama that later unfolded. Exactly as BtcDrak [predicted](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-October/013184.html) in his reply to Sergios bitcoin mailing list [post](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-October/013178.html) October 2016. Unfortunately Sergio seems to have lacked the mental capacity at the time to understand what was explained to him and didn't change course.

Besides Sergio and Timo, Bitmain also holds or held ASICBoost patents in China (which probably infringe on the other ones).

Those patents made it impossible to use overt ASICBoost without risking lawsuits. Covert ASICBoost was also patented, but Bitmain and possibly others could still use it secretly due to the fact that it's next to impossible to detect it's use when implemented correctly.

Nevertheless, when u/nullc (Greg Maxwell) [discovered](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-April/013996.html) that SegWit basically breaks covert ASICBoost, he also found that Bitmain implemented it in it's mining hardware. Bitmain later confirmed the allegations but pretends (to this day) that it was only implemented for shits and giggles and never actually used covertly. (LOL!)  

Only after the patents were acquired by *Little Dragon Technology LLC* and made available for free via the *Blockchain Defensive Patent License* things took a turn for the better. Unfortunately very few companies in the space have pledged their support for the *BDPL* so far with Blockstream being one of the very few positive examples.

Bitcoin Magazine has a good [article](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/there-bitcoin-patent-war-going-initiative-could-end-it) on this.

Thanks to those efforts, others can now use overt ASICBoost and the mining hardware marked stayed competitive. Otherwise it would have become a monopoly for the patent holder with most likely catastrophic consequences.

Just one more example of how bad (software) patents really are, I guess...

These consensus rules can be changed of course but doing so simply creates an altcoin and not Bitcoin. Bitcoin is voluntary and non coercive so you are free to change the consensus rules and create your own altcoin, but the original chain will still be Bitcoin. 

The game theory and incentives are heavily against people changing the controlled supply however as that essentially means the people invested in Bitcoin are purposely damaging bitcoin's brand and reputation and devaluing their own savings via added inflation. Selfish motivations alone will insure that most Bitcoin users decide to keep the 21 million limit and not follow any altcoin changing this.",fy1ggie,2020-07-14 23:40:05,12

It was amazing to live through at the time. Today seems so boring in comparison, but back in those days there were far fewer of us. We'd come from Bitcoin and got fed up with the lack of progress and toxic community there. I used to live on the ethereum subreddit at one point.

Damn, it was early 2014 I can find emails from and I think extended back to late 2013!

True story - I was chatting to vitalik at an event in London, where I also met one Stephan Tual over drinks, shortly after he'd interviewed me about games &amp; blockchain. This was summer 2013 I reckon. I said to a friend of mine that someone in that small room was going to be the next Mark Zuckerberg (well, this was before he turned out to be awful!). At the same time, I asked Vitalik if it had been worth him quitting studying to do Bitcoin. Oops.

Thank god you did Vitalik ;)

Also, Stephan Tual does not get the credit he deserves around Ethereum. Whatever his mistakes, and he'd be the first to admit he made a few, he did an astonishing amount of community building back then. I hope some day he gets that credit at least.",fy1uz73,2020-07-15 01:41:20,18

**For context:**

Hasan is talking to KimDotCom, the man behind the infamous site MegaUpload, about the hack today on Twitter in which tens of high-profile verified accounts from corporations to celebrities to politicians were tweeting out bitcoin addresses in order to scam $ by claiming to double it upon the money being received. 

KimDotCom is alleging that this was likely done by abusing a backdoor installed by Twitter at the request of the US Government, as no normal 'power user' or staff member in theory would have such powers. And that the Wikileaks files about NSA backdoors in social media sites / big tech products shows that this is reality. 

EDIT: At the same time, some tech journalists are hypothesizing that the hack might have been of a support account which can change authentication settings on any account and thus leave them breachable.

As of now, Verified users are having their tweet ability restrained.

These benefits are going to keep on relentlessly building with the launch of eth2 and rapid development of dapps and defi.

* In the past 30 days, the total amount of BTC locked up on the lightning network went from [954 to 994](https://defipulse.com/lightning-network)
* In the same period, the total amount of BTC locked up on Ethereum went from [5,837 to 15,412](https://btconethereum.com/)

A decentralized distributes ledger is the way to achieve a true fixed supply and resist the temptation to increase supply.  Scarcity leads to value as the theory goes.  ADA improves where BTC failed with the POS system.

Both ETH and Tezos have infinite supply and that is a distinguishing feature of ADA in a POS system.  EOS has a built in 5% inflation to reward block producers.  So ADA is the one staying committed to fixed supply.

Regarding inflation being necessary to a healthy economy, where does that assumption come from? We’ve never had an economy with a true fixed supply of anything to know the effects.
There is also the fact that it will take, what 100 years?, for ADA to reach its fixed supply.

To prove source of funds we had to show the original investment leaving his bank account, screen prints from coinfloor trading account and proceeds coming back in to his bank account. It helped that my client had published an article in bitcoin around the time of the original investment and also held a prominent job in financial services. Mortgage lnders are super wary about bitcoin though because of AML so expect more scrutiny and hoop jumping and possibly for it to not happen.

Not very attractive.  


People don't talk about at which price point they plan on exiting their house or selling all their savings that follows the market, because they assume that the use of the house and the price of the traditional investments will trend upward over time indefinitely, the point they discuss converting those to cash is in case of changes in life circumstances, not the price reaching some point.  


Bitcoin actually being what it is advertised as, a ~~stable~~ store of value or currency, the question of ""What price Exit Bitcoin"" would not even make sense, people would save or use Bitcoin, but they would never exit it outside of necessity like having to pay for a unexpected expense no matter the price at that time.",fyn7cjs,2020-07-20 18:39:14,34

A set amount of Bitcoin is released each year by the system based on a formula. The system itself deals out the Bitcoin. The equations was just the way the founders went about doing it, it meant you needed to dedicate processing power to maintaining the block chain, and that the amount of power dedicated shows how much the computer is supporting the system. 

Bitcoin is actually a well thought out system it's just that many people involved in the industry are a little nuts.",fyq1bzn,2020-07-21 10:48:07,277
Marthinwurer,"[3blue1brown does a good job of explaining it here, but I'll take a shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4)

Basically, the math equation that governs how bitcoin works is SHA-256, a cryptographic hashing algorithm. It takes whatever data you want to input to it, and turns it into a 256-digit binary number. It's cryptographic, which means that it's very, very hard to find out what data you put into it if you only have the output number. It's reasonably easy to go from data to number, though. 

The data that is used in bitcoin is a block of orders. These are individual transactions on the bitcoin blockchain, as well as a reference to the previous block. Each block also awards some bitcoins to the whoever mines it.

To mine bitcoin, you take a fresh block, add a nonce to it, and hash it. Your goal is to come up with a rare enough hash that the rest of the bitcoin network will accept it. This requires a certain number of leading zeros in your hash, the binary number that you get from your hashing algorithm. If your hash isn't rare enough, you come up with a different nonce and try again. In 2015, you had to try 200 quintillion nonces to mine a block. Things are way harder now. 

So, the math equations are part of the system. The miners solve them to prove that they looked hard enough for the right nonce to fit into the system, and thus deserve your bitcoins.",fyq4r3f,2020-07-21 11:21:34,152
thadpole,"They weren't always. The first bitcoins sold for pennies and the hashes could be found using old computers relatively quickly. 

When bitcoin launched, anyone could mine and find bitcoin in a relatively small window.

Now, the hashes are so long and hard to find that even a specially made bitcoin mining computer would barely break the cost of electricity and would have to join a network of thousands of computers (similar to robinhood stock trading app except instead of buying stock youre solving sudokus using an algorithm together).

The only reason they have any value is because people are willing to trade currency for it. Bitcoin has low transfer costs compared to traditional methods such as western union. Centralized banking is actually not widely available and bitcoin allows transfer between two people with cell phones for a marginal fee.

Bitcoin is mainly used to trade illegal things such as drugs, stolen credit cards, clothing directly from sweatshops for dirt cheap. I have personally purchased marijuana lsd extasy and dmt from Brazil to Amsterdam and only been burned once or twice for twenty bucks here or there. 

Its like Amazon, customers leave reviews of sellers. People are established and there is legitimate competition in the market. Prices are way cheaper youll find on the street and I've never run into anything cut or fake.

Lodgik,"Dear 13 year old me,

Hello from the future!  I'm your 35 years old self.  Hello!

I write this to you to warn you of several things, including bad choices you make that have major repercussions for the future.

First, you currently have undiagnosed ADD.  I know you think you are just lazy because that's what everyone is telling you, but it's ADD.  Bug your mother to see a psychiatrist.  Get some meds.  Things will go much easier for you if you do, instead of waiting to find out until your 30.  It'll make future bosses happier as well.  Hell, you might not get kicked out of your first high school because you didn't pass any of the classes and couldn't actually be bothered to go!

Second, lose some god damn weight.  Start working out some more.  It's much easier at the age your at then waiting until your older like I did.  I know your mother makes some delicious meals, and you can still have them, just eat... less.

Third, take better care of your god damn teeth.  Trust me.

Fourth, get some speech therapy.  Sooner the better.  I know this is unimaginable to you right now, since you are really ashamed of your stutter.  You don't even want to admit that you have a problem, because that would be admitting there's something *wrong* with you.  While you will get over that in your early twenties, that attitude will make your teenage years hell.  Because you didn't go until you were twenty, you had to deal with all the emotional baggage that came with it.  It made your teenage years very lonely.  Don't make that mistake again.

5th, in a few years, you might meet a girl named Jenny.  She will seem really friendly, and you will just be happy to have a close friend again.  You will even develop a crush on her.  When you do meet her, run away.  Run away as fast as you can as far as you can.  She is Satan incarnate and that friendship will turn slowly more and more emotionally abusive as the years go on.  She will slowly demolish any form of self-confidence you have and convince you that all of your other friends don't really like you, that no one really likes you and they find you annoying, and all you have is her.  She will have you wrapped around her finger as her substitute boyfriend and she will fuck you over again and again.  She will ruin years of your life.

6th, so there's this thing called bitcoin in the future...",fyuy1cl,2020-07-22 19:26:28,865
SaltyPockets,"&gt;First, there is a macroeconomic problem that has to do with monetary  policy and that today with the COVID-19 economic crisis is more relevant  than ever. Money is supposed to be a reflection of real economic value,  but some central banks print money arbitrarily. Bitcoin’s monetary  supply is limited by design.

And so fails to be a reflection of anything at all but an arbitrary number pulled from satoshi's butthole.

&gt;Second, centralized financial services are discriminatory and don’t  allow free access to everyone. Bitcoin is universal and free. This means  that for the first time in human history, everyone will be able to  participate in the global economy.

If they pay an existing hodler for some bitcoin, and if they have the right equipment to use it and if anyone accepts it and .... well it's sure as shit not free, if you don't pay the miners you don't get your transaction, and they can decide not to include arbitrary transactions they don't care for and ...

&gt;Bitcoin allows people to have full ownership and control of their  personal and financial information, protecting both their identity and  their wealth.

Bullshit. Plain old bullshit. Most humans don't have anything that could be described as ""wealth"" to start with. Also there are reasons, really really good reasons that we de-anonymised most banking over the last few decades. Even the Swiss fell into line in the end.

tl;dr - it's the usual tripe.",fyuy9tn,2020-07-22 19:30:24,32
bitusher,"Do not day trade , most people day trading end up losing money. 

Here is some general advice.

1)	Do you have high interest debt (5% and higher) and no savings?

If the answer is Yes - Do not invest in any Bitcoin.

2)	Do you have any credit card debt and fiat savings?

If the answer is Yes ,than at minimum pay off all your credit card debt with fiat savings unless you are in debt to such a degree and plan on filing bankruptcy. Do not invest in Bitcoin until you have paid off all high interest debt

3)	Have a lot of low interest credit card debt (below 5%) and no fiat savings?

You should make a budget , cut expenses, and simultaneously start paying off your debt(unless you plan to file chapter 7 bankruptcy) , start saving a fiat emergency fund, and start buying Bitcoin.

4)	Have no debt and no fiat savings?

You should make a budget , cut expenses, start simultaneously saving for 6-12 months worth of living expenses in fiat emergency fund (only stable forms of fiat, obviously not the Argentinian peso or Venezuelan bolivar) and invest in Bitcoin, and seriously consider investing in stocks(preferable an index fund ETF like SPDR) or a IRA.

5) You have a large amount of fiat savings and no debt and want to know if its best to dollar cost average invest or invest it all immediately?

The answer almost always is to make a plan and invest 100% of the fiat (not including your emergency fund) immediately in a diversified portfolio of investments that are non correlated (land, stocks, Bitcoin, businesses with positive cash flow) . It is often impossible to time the market and those that invest earlier will gain the most compound interest. The reason why dollar cost average investment is popular and a fine strategy is merely because most people don't have a large amount of fiat to invest upfront so invest a little each time they are paid.

Here is a useful tool for you - https://dcabtc.com

Thus if you get paid twice a month than what you should do is buy some Bitcoin immediately twice a month and also in addition set buy limit orders on an exchange for 5-10% below spot price. If those orders do not get filled by  the following paycheck than buy your set amount and reset the buy limit orders for 5-10% below spot price from the current market price.
The reason for this is 2 fold:

1)	you can auto pickup savings with BTC volatility on the dips which is psychologically rewarding

2)	If a large amount of people create large amounts of Buy limit support than BTC becomes more stable unit of account and more liquid leading to more investor confidence and making BTC more of a currency(less volatility = better unit of account) and thus increases the likelihood your investment will continue appreciating in value.


The reason having a fiat savings account is so important is it not only will it save you if you lose a job or have an unexpected car expense or medical bill, but that it makes you a more rational investor that is less stressed out by the volatility in your more risky investments like Bitcoin. Bitcoin historically has had at least 2 bear markets lasting a little over 1 year thus you need to be prepared to not be forced to sell at a loss for at least 2 years to give yourself enough of a buffer.",fyv0ycs,2020-07-22 20:13:01,52

Mark_Bear,"Beware of a ""cashless society"".

This is serious.

For example, **negative interest rates**.  Suppose you're saving for a car,  a home,  a college education, or just a nice, long vacation trip.  You put your money in the bank.

In the old days, the bank paid you interest to entice you to leave your money with them. They would loan it out and make a profit.  Nowdays, you get zero interest (or nearly zero).

Suppose the bank charged you money to park your cash there.  You might keep adding to your savings, but your balance stays flat, or goes down.  Today, if they did that, you could just hide your cash at home and choose to not pay the bank this ""negative interest"" (they'll call it 'fees' or some euphemism).

**Suppose there's no more cash**.  You ***can't*** take cash out of the bank.  You can't stop them from just taking it from you.  You can't earn money without them knowing about every cent and from whom you got it.  You can't spend a cent without them knowing who you gave it to and (most likely) what you got in return.

Suppose you donated money to a political cause.  The people in power might label that group, conveniently, as a ""terrorist organization,"" after the fact.  They'd check their computers and see that you gave money to ""terrorists.""  Now you're on the ""terrorist"" list and with the click of a mouse they can **block you from being able to receive or to spend any money whatsoever.**

They would certainly ban our ability to convert between Bitcoin and their ""cashless money"".

freebit,"Not financial advice. Don't listen to me.

For your 401k, just keep it in an index fund or some extremely far off Vanguard target fund (e.g. 2065). Honestly, most 401k's have lackluster options at best. Just do it, you need the tax break and free money match. Even though I say lackluster, index funds are still very solid choices long term.

For your taxable and roth IRA, you may want to look into the Permanent Portfolio or the All Weather Portfolio or Golden Butterfly. Those will keep you in the game while still providing around a 9% CAGR. They will also limit draw downs to 10-15% or so. It was amazing to watch in it action during the March crash. The performance of my portfolio over the last year is ~14%. You really need to do your homework here because it is not a conventional portfolio and may have associated controversy.

An alternative, and one I DON'T follow, is to invest for dividends and tell yourself that you don't care at all about the stock price. Just give me those sweet sweet dividends! Even though I don't do it, it is still a very viable option. If you don't want to learn how to pick dividend stocks, then just pick some popular dividend etf's (e.g. VYM, VIG, DGRO, DGRW, SPHD, SPYD). Equal parts all of those will give you exposure to a thousands of companies, give or take. Back test all the way to the last GFC to ensure you feel safe. This is an option, just make sure you do your homework so you can be a believer long term. Dividends are a lifestyle choice that can border on religion, lol.

I am going to give one last idea. I think of this idea as diversification more than a realistic winner. Take an amount you don't care about, say 1%, and throw it at a weird controversial moonshot. Something silly but something you believe in strongly personally. One example is bitcoin. If it goes to zero, then it was only 1%, no biggie. If it goes to the moon, then perhaps in 20 years you can reap the rewards. It doesn't have to be bitcoin. It could be Chilean lithium mines. I don't know. Just pick something that floats your boat and is weird and off-the-wall.

With interest rates super low, corporate bonds are a bad idea and they don't provide protection anymore anyways. Look into these when the Fed rate gets back to ~10% (it never will get that high in my lifetime). 

Long term treasuries are not the same as corporate bonds. So, don't confuse them. Look up bond convexity and yield curve control. Bond convexity will blow your mind. Basically, if you own TLT now and yield curve control is implemented, then TLT will double in value, very roughly, give or take.

On the other hand if inflation takes off, then gold and stocks will increase in value and TLT will drop in half as interest rates go up. So, long term treasuries can be awesome.",fywiy3c,2020-07-23 04:22:26,29

Now with Binance listing and by entering in Top 100, VTHO will catch a lot of new eyes and many people will discover the potential of investment in VTHO when they realize that the main purpuse of VET is to generate VTHO. The question is will those one who do the math buy VET and waith 50+ years to generate VTHO or will they use the same amount of money to buy VTHO directly?! With current ratio theres only one reasonable answer.

For a long time, (if you look my previous posts, even when the price of VTHO was at around 10X lower price from current price) i was convinced VTHO will be one of the biggest gainers if not the winner among all altcoins. Im still convinced VTHO is one of the most undervalued coins. Additionaly, it was not premined so in one way its like Bitcoin in early days without team members and ""advisors"" holding full bags of free premined coins to create large sell walls and sell preasure.

VTHO is still unknown token for wider audience so the potential gain is huge, its so expensive now to generate VTHO that i would not even consider to dump hard earned VTHO at any price just to accumulate more VET. Just take an hour or two and do the math before you set the sell price target and remember that that money you have invested in VET will be worth much more how the price of VTHO goes up.

fully_completely,"“Part 1”

* Wasn’t going to address this and Morgan has been asking her for months, but with all the DMs/comments she wanted to make sure that we all understood that she wasn’t okay staying in an abusive relationship for 10 years. Wants to clarify this. She was called every name in the book, including body shaming :( (I will not repeat any of the horrible names). Wants to share what she dealt with before and after the show and made a list of all the lies she found out about after TI because they’re crazy.
* Met Evan when they were 19, right before he went to USC for a full ride (basketball). Tried to date, didn’t work out, (dating a college athlete is a nightmare). From 2009-2012 they were very on and off and dated other people.
* 2012 his dad died, she would never talk down on that. She says it made a change in him. Talked about how she was supportive of him and his family and very involved… said he did the same thing that he did on TI in Summer 2012. He had a psychotic breakdown and moved to Washington and dated a random Volleyball player he barely knew for 3 months. She said that he has done this before,  it was a pattern… has breakdowns and starts a new life.
* At that point kicked him out completely, but on his birthday her friends encouraged her to reach out, he texted back immediately (she had been ignoring him for months even though he had texted her a lot). She noticed a big change in him… said she went to go hang out with him and he was loving and affectionate and kind. 3 weeks after this they went exclusive. From that point until weeks before TI things were good and they were best friends. Said he had a lying problem but didn’t realize how bad until after TI.
* 2-3 years before filming TI, she turned 26-27 got her shit together, got a FT job running Gap stores in Hawaii and California, was In higher management, got her own apartment. She was expecting him to be an adult, pay equal on the bills ... (Cut the video of here because of her  pup so went a bit off topic when she came back in the next paragraph)
* Says her dad had an analogy about her and Evan and it was the frog in boiling water (when she first met him it was normal water and slowly the water just kept getting hotter, at TI it was boiling and she was like ""WTF am I in?"")
* During College was normal for him not to have a job as he was on a full ride on his basketball scholarship, then his dad happened and wasn’t going to get on his ass then about getting a job. When she was 26-27 was when she needed things to change and told him they both needed to be adults. Thats when the gaslighting and mental and emotional abuse started because he knew she wouldn't put up with bullshit anymore and enable him. Says her confidence was intimidating to Evan.
* Her friends and family said it got to the point where she wasn't herself anymore. Was very careful, her anxiety was out of control, couldn't eat infront of Evan. He would pick fights with people on the street (beating the shit out of people), punch holes in walls, small doors. Spit on her at a Christmas party, recorded it and tried to make it look like it was her fault. Those were just small things in the 2-3 years before TI. He full blown brainwashed her during these years.
* She knew in her heart and gut something was wrong and started researching and reading, but she was so brainwashed by Evan that she convinced herself that her anxiety was out of control, because Evan would constantly tell her that. She would try to leave him and he would sob uncontrollably and threaten to hurt himself. She has a huge heart and is sensitive and he knew that she wouldn't leave him if he did that.
* Feb 2018 (before they went on TI) - they shared an iPad and she opened it and it opened into his Instagram DM's and there were 40-60 messages from women. She found all kinds of shit like he was facetiming his Ex even though he told her she was stalking him. She told him he had 3 days to get out. He had a full blown breakdown, it was really bad, she left work early because she was worried about him. She came home and the ""infamous ultimatum happened"". He told her he'd do anything. She laid it down seriously and told him how it would work. Said he needed to get a FT job and needed to pay 50/50 of the bills. Said the behaviour - if she even thought things were going down he was out instantly on the streets. Mentioned that his mom venmo'd her $400 a month rent. Said she needed a real commitment by her birthday. Said he was a gentleman from that moment on until the moment they parted ways on the first episode of TI.
* After the show it was bad, doesn't remember what happened. People told her how insane it was but what we saw doesn't even do it justice how bad it was. Remembers being in the car and going through McDonalds. She went to a Hotel room by herself and sat up on the bed all night until the sun came up watching Talladega nights on a marathon repeat (11-6). Went to sleep for 45 minutes, did her last interview, went to the airport had a redeye flight with huge suitcase. Get to LAX at 6AM, (says this is hard to talk about) knew she had to save as much money and needed to figure out how to get all her luggage across the airport into an Uber and it was horrible and she just needed to get through it without breaking down.
* She never reached out to him after that, never wanted to speak with him again. When they got back, his brother had been watching the show and Evan had reached out (Happy Birthday, DMing her friends, DMing her, crying in public). His brother said she had to let him come over, she let him sleep on the couch with no pillow no blanket sobbing on the couch all night.

* Kaci had a fully paid off car she loved, when they were moving back she sold that car in order to get them back to LA, under the impression he would ship his over. Months went by, it never came and he made up a story about how he talked to the dealership in Hawaii and would sell it back to the dealership. He stopped making payments on the car the second they moved to LA for months , had been getting repossession letters, lawsuit letters and they couldn't find the car. He told Morgan that Kaci didn't have a license to drive, never owned a car and that she's irresponsible. 
* 10 years she knew Evan he worked for 9 months at a restaurant. The entire time they lived in LA he lived on unemployment and Kaci paid for absolutely everything (except the $400 a month rent from his mom). She worked at GAP (operations manager) and worked at a tanning salon. Would wake up at 2-3AM to work at Gap and then work at 1-2 in the afternoon. Would take a bus from the mall to tanning place (hours on a bus). Would work until 9 at night and get home at 11. Would get home and Evan would do nothing, be high as F and have eaten all the food she paid for. She did this 6 days a week and would cry at work because of how exhausted she was. Told her that he will be strong for her later in life when they have kids. Told the cast that Kaci was the one at home while he was out hustling and being a ""bitcoin baby"".",fyxibht,2020-07-23 09:24:01,53

Etereve,"Say ETH goes to a modest 0.13 on the ratio, which it's done before. With no BTC movement that's roughly $1,250. Nobody outside crypto notices because Bitcoin gets the headlines.

BTC gets to $16,000 at that ratio. That's roughly $2,100 ETH. Few notice because Bitcoin's still 25 percent below all-time high and ETH's well short of flippening.

At that point the craziness wouldn't have even started. Then sprinkle in a BTC ATH. A surge into ETH as people take one last bucket of profit from BTC and the flippening commences... It's a recipe for moon.

 * The full quote from satoshi is: ""We can phase in a change later if we get closer to needing it."" It's clear in context that he meant, eventually we *would* need to increase the limit. Just not right at the time of writing
 * Just because you can have state channels, doesn't mean that the core system should stay at 1mb forever. Those are two unrelated things
 * Just because you can and should build layer 2 solutions, doesn't mean that layer 1 should be arbitrarily crippled. In Ethereum, they solved this by allowing miners to vote on ""block size"", and that's been going pretty well, gently adjusting the block gas limit when it makes sense to do so
 * Yes, Andresen knew that Bitcoin wasn't optimal, and that layer 2 is important. I fully agree
 * Yes Garzik argued against raising the limit in **2012** but subsequently and repeatedly argued for it to be raised — later — i.e. when we got, to quote Satoshi, ""closer to needing it""
 * Yeah yeah I'm an idiot who didn't even hear of bitcoin when blah blah blah, cool ad hominem

Brunswickstreet,"I'll try to explain this step by step for all the newcomers and other people who havent traded actively. So what you see here is called an orderbook and is essentially what you see when you trade Bitcoin on exchanges like Binance or derivatives markets like Bitmex. 

The green steps are buy orders, so people that want to buy Bitcoin, the red steps are sell orders, so people that want to sell Bitcoin. The middle between both these orders is the current price. 

So lets say the price is $9.450 if I wanted to sell at $9.455 I'd be on the right of the orderbook pretty close to the middle. If I wanted to sell at $9.600 I would also be on the right but much further up, away from the middle. Now if I want to buy I'm on the left side, the further my buy order is away from the actual price the further I'm away from the middle. Now if two orders meet in the middle, BTC is being traded and a new current price is agreed on. Thats actually how the price of Bitcoin is determined on a global scale, if a seller and a buyer agree on a price.

What happens a lot in crypto is that buy- or sellwalls are set up to create artificial pressure on the price because people looking at the order book see the huge sell-orders and cant imagine all these Bitcoins being bought so the price drops. Most of the time at the exact same moment these walls are being touched, people pull them because they didnt actually want to sell their BTC but just wanted to supress or prop up the price. In this case though, it looked like a legitimate cluster of sell-orders that just got eaten up by buyers and pushed us through $9.500.",fyyghxy,2020-07-23 15:44:18,99

Tricky_Troll,"Now that we’ve had a bit of time to collect ourselves after our recent dopamine rush, I’d like to take a look at all of the factors which I see affecting ETH’s price in the coming months. Naturally, I have a bullish bias and I will almost certainly be wrong about some of the following points, but we only really need a few of these possible factors to come to reality to get ETH moving.

I’m really starting to think that we are on the brink of something big. There are so many bullish events on the horizon on the condition that traditional markets don’t shit the bed. The recent breakout has [pushed us up to resistance levels on the ETH/BTC ratio](https://i.imgur.com/HOvOfHJ.jpg) which if we break through, we won’t have seen in over a year. A break above 0.028 would be incredibly bullish. Not only this, but Bitcoin is also looking like it wants to breakout after two months of sideways action. If it does break out, ETH could see some incredibly explosive growth on the top of Bitcoins gains since ETH typically outperforms BTC when BTC is above its 20 week moving average.

Now that the parabolic DeFi token price action is calming down and 2x gains in a week are no longer ubiquitous, it wouldn’t surprise me to see people start moving back into the blue chip cryptos (ETH and BTC) to avoid the impending volatility and pullback in alts. On top of this, we will of course have ETH 2.0 staking hype leading into the final months of this year. I’m beginning to expect that we could see a [2016 or mid-2017 type move](https://i.imgur.com/bIP1LwR.jpg) on the ratio for ETH. To back up this movement, I think it is very likely that the stock market will remain “strong” through ’til election time as Trump will do everything he can to keep markets looking strong (And by that I mean convincing J Pow and the gang over at the Fed to keep up the [brrr](https://brrr.money/)). He has shown many times before (through Twitter of course) that one of the things he cares about most in terms of how the public perceives him is by looking at the performance of the stock market. Therefore, keeping up this facade will be important to him for his re-election prospects.

Going into 2021, following a 2016-eque pump for the ratio, I think a pullback for the ETH/BTC ratio would be likely and could coincide with BTC breaking ATH. Since Bitcoin breaking its all-time high will be mainstream news, Bitcoin would likely lead the charge for a while like in late 2016 as it takes time for newcomers and institutions to understand the wider crypto markets. Eventually, I imagine ETH will have another pump as BTC goes parabolic and people search for returns elsewhere. At this point, the ratio could potentially get back into ATH territory and even flippening territory. However, I personally think that the possibility of hyperinflation in fiat currencies would actually push adoption of Bitcoin more than ETH due to the easily understood and meme-able 21 million hard cap. I see the day ETH flipping BTC as being after ETH 2.0 has rolled out, allowing for trillions of dollars of value to be settled on Ethereum and transacted relatively cheaply. Unfortunately, I doubt that this day will be before the end of this bull cycle. Despite this, I am certain that this day will come eventually.

**In conclusion, I think that the next 6 months are the perfect storm for ETH. To recap:**

1. BTC is looking ready to move and bring the whole crypto market with it.
2. The ETH ratio has broken out of a multi-year long bear trend and has historically shot up very fast. It very well could do this again in the next few months once we break through the last major resistance levels.
3. The alt-season seems to be cooling off and people will start looking to take profits in the blue chip cryptos (BTC and ETH)
4. ETH 2.0 staking hype will be insane. Most coins pulled at least a 2x in advance of staking (See Cardano, EOS and other ETH attempted murderers.)
5. Trump calling for the fed to keep up money printing up until the election to improve his re-election chances.

This is of course highly speculative and I will inevitable get things in this post wrong. However, I think that a good number of these things I laid out will happen and it’s important to consider how they may interact even if only one or two of these factors come into play in the coming months. Also, I urge you to be patient, November is months, not weeks away, so it will take some time for any of these factors to start coming into play, but when they do, it should be spectacular.

Have there really haven't been any concrete proposal before? I could've sworn I've seen multiple proposals?

&gt; Bitcoin ABC is therefore moving forward with the Grasberg DAA.

Sounds exactly like the other times were ABC just decides this is the algorithm we'll go with. I hope people have had time to review it sufficiently this time before they just went with it.

&gt; Bitcoin ABC has already run simulations and real-world testing of this algorithm, but is inviting other parties to reproduce the results - hopefully - or not. 

Oh...

So ABC are now inviting other parties to reproduce their results, after they've already made their choice?

gotamd,"The tone of that blog post is so bizarre, especially right after the dev meeting that included both Amaury and Jonathan (just 1 week ago). The article describes Grasberg as being based on ASERT, which is exactly what Toomim proposed doing. The blog indicated that no concrete proposal existed, yet [Toomim's proposal](https://read.cash/@jtoomim/bch-upgrade-proposal-use-asert-as-the-new-daa-1d875696) was concrete and he even published C++ code [here](https://gitlab.com/jtoomim/bitcoin-cash-node/-/commit/fd92035c2e8d16360fb3e314b626bf52f2a2be67#ee35cfc09ad35fa12b8d0a6280a950e4edde3d20_285_299).

Amaury also announced that, ""Bitcoin ABC is therefore moving forward with the Grasberg DAA.""  Where did this even come from?  He was one of the main voices who was calling for everyone to step back to further develop a problem statement even just last week. I don't understand why this is written in a way that completely ignores Jonathan Toomim's prior work and the previous discussions. It tastes like sour grapes to me, honestly.

EDIT: I want to add to this that I wonder if Amaury thinks he's playing some ""4D chess"" here by forcing the hand of all other node implementations. They either get on the ABC train or BCH splits in November. This is a particularly awful way to achieve his goals, and I honestly hope he doesn't succeed and ABC becomes a dead chain (assuming they persist with the attempt to dictate their preferences over cooperation with other developers and the community at large).",fz0aj1j,2020-07-24 03:47:12,48
BigBlockIfTrue,"There are numerous severe problems with this article:

* This article complains no concrete proposal has been made yet, but the Jonathan Toomim's ASERT proposal is way more concrete than this Grasberg thing, as evidenced by multiple implementations already being in development.
* The relative formulation of ASERT is chosen despite the absolute formulation being superior on all aspects other than the temporary activation logic inconvenience for which Jonathan Toomim already proposed a simpler solution (fixing the block height).
* A simple polynomial formula was replaced with a formula involving giant lookup tables. The giant lookup table makes the code impossible to read and humanly verify.
* The lack of drift correction is suddenly considered unacceptable for ASERT but was never deemed problematic in all previous DAA changes.
* There is no beginning of a description of how the drift correction is supposed to work, let alone any robustness analysis of this mechanism or any assessment of potentially undesired side effects.
* Never in the history of bitcoin was there a drift correction mechanism. Despite the stated purpose to preserve the original emission policy, adding drift correction is itself a redefinition of the emission policy. It even literally contradicts the ""moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour"" from the bitcoin whitepaper (p. 3) - it is no longer moving and the target is now something different.
* Unlike the extensive ASERT proposal by Jonathan Toomim, zero simulation results or other quantitative analyses are presented in this article.",fz0ctqt,2020-07-24 04:04:53,52

This is rather cheeky and disingenuous. The issue here isn't that there's no concrete proposal. There definitely is. The issue is that it isn't written based on Bitcoin ABC, and hasn't been submitted to Bitcoin ABC as a code diff against their repo. Instead, the concrete proposal is based on BCHN, and they were asked to review the proposal as a diff against the BCHN repo.

Bitcoin ABC is definitely aware of the [existing implementation](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/merge_requests/692/diffs). The fact that they object to it as not a ""concrete proposal \[which\] has reached ABC"" suggests that they do not think it is reasonable for ABC to read or copy code in other BCH full node implementations or other repositories. Instead, all other BCH full node implementations should need to read or copy code from ABC. This is problematic, and it suggests that there is a non-technical problem here.

Edit: a few hours later, and I've copy-pasted the existing implementation over [onto Bitcoin ABC's codebase](https://github.com/jtoomim/bitcoin-abc/commit/83de74761631e509cba3fd58455b9f094e219a8c).",fz0ep2t,2020-07-24 04:19:31,88

fully_completely,"RECAP!!

* Evan Told Morgan that her parents are white trash and that he has met them twice. Her parents did so much for Evan, went on vacation together, family dinners, movie nights, countless hangouts. Her parents bought very thoughtful and expensive gifts.  Was very welcomed into the family. One time he couldn't afford food and his dad sent food to his house.
   * Felt her dad could relate to Evan  - being an athlete, being a player when he's younger, having a stressed relationship with his dad. Wanted to be there for him and welcome him into the family.
* Told Morgan and everyone that all of his friends hate her and are glad they aren't together because ""she's crazy"". Didn't want to get into that too much as she has a lot of respect for his friends and developed their own friendships. He was telling them that he was going to propose to Kaci on the show and that she was the one, would get a ring from the network. Everytime that Evan spoke to them they said it was all good.
* When he was downtown LA with morgan on her birthday days after filming TI, he was sobbing in public, texting her (she wasn't answering) and told Morgan and Erica that he was crying because she maxed out their credit card on Louis Vuitton. Was texting her that he thought he took things too far, was having panic attacks, needed to see ghost. They never even had a shared credit card. She says she's never owned anything designer in her life
* Morgan leaves to fly home and Evans little brother convinces Kaci to let him come over. She had her headphones on to drown him out when he was sobbing all night on the couch. Said that production turned them against each other, he is doubting his feelings for morgan, felt he took things too far between them. He was trying to gaslight her, spend two days together... did errands together and hung out. But did nothing like kissing or sleeping together. He encouraged texts and calls, this went on for a week. He dumped her again in a psycho novel text message. Two hours before that he sent heart emojis and ""thinking about you"". She responded with ""ok, do your thang"" type response and he was pissed by her response. She couldn't get him out of her house at this point, he left his dog there and it was aggressive. When he was out she left for the whole day, she expected everything to be gone when she came back but he took nothing, but went through all of her things. He was trying to stay attached.
* Once he knew she was done he moved out on Oct 27. Was constantly trying to stay in her life and make her presence known, was reaching out to her friends, would send her novels blaming her for everything that happened on the island. She would wake up and there would be heart emojis on her insta pics and then would delete it 9 hours later. He was harassing her for months and on NYE 2018 she sent him a novel of truth bombs. She had not heard from him since that as she basically verbally destroyed him.
* Says she doesn't want him to know where he lives because he's aggressive and sick. This is a reason why she is hesitant with Morgan as she has been still talking to him. Says she doesn't judge her for this.
* After her birthday when she let him over he wanted to talk and he wanted to know about her time on the island, asked if she made any connections. Said she was very careful about the response because she didn't want him to know his name, said in the past he'd target guys she was interested in. Told him that she had a real connection with someone but kept the promise and avoided him like the plague because she didn't want to cheat. He went back a bit on the couch, his eyes got big and he was very taken aback. Told him she had never felt that way before and felt like her best self. He told her ""Well I'm sorry to have to tell you this but I saw screenshots of all the single guys talking saying they want nothing to do with you and think you're unattractive."" and ""if you tell anyone about what I told you we're over for good"". She immediately texted the few guys she was close with and the one guy in particular that this was not true, to get him to show her what he saw. He DID target that person and followed him, tweeted him, asked to go to NY.  (She gets upset here and almost cries) Says he was on a mission to fuck that up and kind of did.
* After the show, left her with a negative bank account balance, unpaid bills, no rent $ that he promised her. Was getting calls from lawyers about money he owed. He stole money from his best friend and said he was going to invest in bitcoin, lost it (clearly didn't invest).
* Mentions some of the things Morgan mentioned in her videos around the lies about bitcoin, owning restaurants, graduating school.
* Told people she had an eating disorder and was suicidal and paid for therapy for her for years. She said this was never ever the case and that she does not have an eating disorder, eats like shit and has bad eating habits. Is just very natural thin and has a fast metabolism. When she's stressed she has no appetite which is why she was so thin on the show. Was never suicidal.
* He told people that she never met his dad, even though she met him 4 times. He made it publicly known that another girlfriend of his was there for him during the entire tragedy. Kaci was one of the first people who found out about his dad, she drove to him immediately, her and her dad were putting up flyers, was making sure the family was fed, picked up his dad's ashes with him. She said this period of time is why she let so many things slide with him
* Throughout the show, was writing him letters mainly just to get her thoughts out, gave them to him after TI after he broke down on her couch. When he realized he couldn't control her anymore and she was ignoring him, he threatened to blackmail her with those letters.
* He has made it very clear to everyone that it was HER idea to go on the show and he didn't want to. She says she was the one who was reached out, thought the DM was a scam - wasn't going to tell Evan because he couldn't mentally handle a show like this... need to be true to yourself, not easily manipulated, have your shit together. She told him about it, he was stoked, said they could get money and have a wedding fund. Was going to use the show for fame and followers, it would change their lives, he couldn't wait to be on TV. He wanted to start the casting process ASAP, they were the first couple cast. Every day that month before they would talk, they made very specific rules and the main thing was understanding they knew they'd be manipulated and until they are actually together, not to believe anything you see on the videos because they know the producers would try to fuck with them. She said ""if they fell for someone, lets respect eachother and break up off camera and pursue that relationship"". He laughed and got emotional and made her pinky promise there was no way that would happen. The night before they started filming he had a full blown breakdown and was on the bathroom floor crying. She told him that if he didn't calm down she was going to have to call 911 or let production know what was happening. He was scared she would fall in love and leave him.
* **Why did she beg on the show?** On her overnight date, those 24-48 hours was one of the best times of her life. Woke up before Val, producer asked her what she was going to do, she told him that she thought she was going to break up at the bonfire, producer was stoked for her. She was very confident at that point, next morning she finds out that she isn't having her bonfire that night, that its been moved to the following night, so a day and a half a way. ""It is what it is"". They told her she wasn't allowed to have her notebook at the bonfire even though they said she could have it with her. On the show he immediately turned things around on her and started gaslighting her and got in her head. She was begging because everything was flooding in at the same time, it wasn't that she was losing someone she loved and she had been trying to get out for so long and he would sob and beg her for second changes. She did every time. Was shook after she sent her other guy away (final date), called him one of the best people she met in her entire life, and couldn't believe she did that. Said she blacked out and still has PTSD from it and even has nightmares about it. Is nervous about bonfires still now.
* How he treated her, how the world treated her... she wanted the world to know this isn't normal. Said he 100% went on the show to find a new her, said her and Morgan were very much alike.
* Says she doesn't take the names she calls Evan lightly. She wants to make it clear she's not a doctor nor does she know his full medical history and to take what we will with it.
* Says TI saved her life. Said she felt like a prisoner.
* After the show he wouldn't let her just live her life, wouldn't let her be happy. Bullied her relentlessly on Instagram Lives.
* ON DATING NOW: Said she is 100% the happiest she's ever been in her life. Said it is really hard for her to find someone who can be patient and understand the gravity of the things she's been through and to take their time with her, it's very scary :(. Doesn't even know where to start. Says it affects her family and friends, everyone who loves her is affected by this. Wants her new life and wants to fall in love again, doesn't even want a new chapter, wants a new book.

Wants to end on two notes:

1. If you love yourself do not be with an Evan, don't be with someone who treats you that way because there will be someone out there who will be crazy about you and will love you, fight for you and be your biggest fan.
2. Be Kind. She has learned from this whole experience that there are some very hateful and mean people in this world.",fz0jm4j,2020-07-24 04:57:28,43

Doing all of that calculation directly on the nBits values would probably be a little more work overall, since we'd have to check for overflow on the exponents as well as carrying on the mantissa, and of course we'd need to separate the two before we did anything. Gaining precision over the current stupid rounding scheme does sound attractive, though. There's a substantial loss in our approximation's precision when we get into the region where nBits only gives us 15 bits of precision (e.g. 0x1c008000 gives a mantissa of 0x8000).",fz48dtj,2020-07-25 03:35:29,25

Dragonchain has demonstrated **twice Reddit’s entire total daily volume (votes, comments, and posts** [**per Reddit 2019 Year in Review**](https://redditblog.com/2019/12/04/reddits-2019-year-in-review/)**)** in a [24-hour demo](https://youtu.be/pSfBid1_US4) on an operational network.  Every single transaction on Dragonchain is decentralized immediately through 5 levels of Dragon Net, and then secured with combined proof on **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, **Ethereum Classic**, and **Binance Chain**, via Interchain. At the time, in January 2020, the entire cost of the demo was approximately $25K on a single system (transaction fees locked at $0.0001/txn). With current fees (lowest fee $0.0000025/txn), this would cost as little as $625.

If you’d like to read the full proposal with formatting go to the [Dragonchain blog](https://dragonchain.com/blog/reddit-ethereum-blockchain-scalability).

## Hello Reddit and Ethereum community!

I’m Joe Roets, Founder &amp; CEO of Dragonchain. When the team and I first heard about The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off we were intrigued. We believe we have the solutions Reddit seeks for its community points system and we have them at scale.

For your consideration, we have submitted our proposal below. The team at Dragonchain and I welcome and look forward to your technical questions, philosophical feedback, and fair criticism, to build a scaling solution for Reddit that will empower its users. Because our architecture is unlike other blockchain platforms out there today, we expect to receive many questions while people try to grasp our project. I will personally answer all questions across two locations. First, I will be live on a special episode of Super Happy Dragon Lucky, Tuesday, July 28th at **6PM EST** where I will answer questions. I will then answer all questions here in this thread on Reddit.

We have seen good discussions so far in the competition. We hope that Reddit’s scaling solution will emerge from The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off and that Reddit will have great success with the implementation.

## Executive summary

Dragonchain is a robust open source hybrid blockchain platform that has proven to withstand the passing of time since our inception in 2014. We have continued to evolve to harness the scalability of private nodes, yet take full advantage of the security of public decentralized networks, like Ethereum. We have a live, operational, and fully functional Interchain network integrating Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and \~700 independent Dragonchain nodes. Every transaction is secured to Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Ethereum Classic. Transactions are immediately usable on chain, and the first decentralization is seen within 20 seconds on Dragon Net. Security increases further to public networks ETH, BTC, and ETC within 10 minutes to 2 hours.

Smart contracts can be written in any executable language, offering full freedom to existing developers. We invite any developer to watch the demo, play with our SDK’s, review open source code, and to help us move forward. Dragonchain specializes in scalable loyalty &amp; rewards solutions and has built a decentralized social network on chain, with very affordable transaction costs. This experience can be combined with the insights Reddit and the Ethereum community have gained in the past couple of months to roll out the solution at a rapid pace.

## Response and PoC

In *The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off* post, Reddit has asked for a series of demonstrations, requirements, and other considerations. In this section, we will attempt to answer all of these requests.

## Live Demo

&gt;A live proof of concept showing hundreds of thousands of transactions

On Jan 7, 2020, Dragonchain hosted a 24-hour live demonstration during which a quarter of a billion (250 million+) transactions executed fully on an operational network. **Every single transaction** on Dragonchain is decentralized immediately through 5 levels of Dragon Net, and then secured with **combined proof** on **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, **Ethereum Classic**, and **Binance Chain**, via Interchain. This means that every single transaction is secured by, and traceable to these networks. An attack on this system would require a simultaneous attack on all of the Interchained networks.

**24 hours in 4 minutes:** [**https://youtu.be/pSfBid1\_US4**](https://youtu.be/pSfBid1_US4)

The demonstration was of a single business system, and any user is able to scale this further, by running multiple systems simultaneously. Our goals for the event were to demonstrate a consistent capacity greater than that of Visa over an extended time period.

Tooling to reproduce our demo is available here:

## Source Code

&gt;Source code (for on &amp; off-chain components as well tooling used for the PoC). The source code does not have to be shared publicly, but if Reddit decides to use a particular solution it will need to be shared with Reddit at some point.

## Scaling

&gt;How it works &amp; scales

## Architectural Scaling

Dragonchain’s architecture attacks the scalability issue from multiple angles. Dragonchain is a hybrid blockchain platform, wherein every transaction is protected on a business node to the requirements of that business or purpose. A business node may be held completely private or may be exposed or replicated to any level of exposure desired.

Every node has its own blockchain and is independently scalable. Dragonchain established *Context Based Verification* as its consensus model. Every transaction is immediately usable on a trust basis, and in time is provable to an increasing level of decentralized consensus. A transaction will have a level of decentralization to independently owned and deployed Dragonchain nodes (\~700 nodes) within seconds, and full decentralization to BTC and ETH within minutes or hours. Level 5 nodes (Interchain nodes) function to secure all transactions to public or otherwise external chains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. These nodes scale the system by aggregating multiple blocks into a single Interchain transaction on a cadence. This timing is configurable based upon average fees for each respective chain.

For detailed information about Dragonchain’s architecture, and *Context Based Verification*, please refer to the [Dragonchain Architecture Document](https://dragonchain.com/Dragonchain-Architecture.pdf).",fz4oni0,2020-07-25 05:45:26,143

Frednn,"Every 10 minutes a new block is mined. The reward for every new block right now is 6.25 BTC ( plus the transaction fees)

To be able to mine 1 BTC every 10 minutes ( 144 BTC / day) , means you should be able to calculate around 22,000,000 Tera hashes per second, or 22,000 peta hashes per second.


That translates to roughly 200,000 antminer S19 units. Each costing at around 2,000 usd. Which is about 400,000,000 usd in mining hardware alone.

Don't forget electricity ! Each unit consumes around 3250 Watts of power just to operate. Running such a huge scale farms needs about 650 MWh of energy !!!


Soooo ... Yeah.

No single person is mining 1 BTC every 10 minutes. Mining Bitcoin is hard. It's deliberately that way to make it a scarce asset. 


People nowadays gather around in virtual groups called "" mining pools "" , and combine their computational power to mine a block. Then they share the reward among pool members based on computational power each member provides.

Deathspiral222,"I'm going to give you exactly one option each time because I assume you want something you can actually do, rather than micromanaging everything. It's all pretty simple:

0. Get any free programs from your job that you can use but forgot to sign up for. 
1. Pay your essential bills (and cut as much crap as you can).
2. If you have money left over, save the money in cash until you have at least a month's expenses (eventually you want six months or so in cash, but just focus on this bit for now).
3. Once you have the one month saved, contribute to your 401K (if you have one) up to the maximum for the match. This money comes out before taxes and it's a fantastic way to save.
4. Pay off your debt above 5% interest.
5. Pay into your 401K until you max it out for the year ($19,500 a year).
6. If you still have money, put up to $6000 into an IRA each year (for both you and your spouse if you have one).
7. If you have kids and want to save for college, set up a 529 plan for each of them, making sure it's one that is good for whatever state you live in. The money will grow tax free if spent on education. Stick whatever you want in here.
8. If you still have money left over, put it in a taxable account with Vanguard.

As for what to invest in: for retirement, you want a (very) low cost ""target date retirement fund"". Basically you decide you are going to retire in, say, 25 years, so you buy the ""2045 Target Date Fund"".

There are two main reasons things may go badly for you: you pay too much in fees, or you get shitty advice and invest in stuff that isn't suitable for you.

You don't need a ""money guy"". You don't need to invest in bitcoin. You don't need a RobinHood options account. Those are all ways to lose money. Just be boring and get boring, average returns. Your main risk right now is yourself - don't chase quick riches with your retirement savings, you are not smart enough to do that (and neither am I). If you want to speculate, do it with a tiny amount of money you can afford to lose.

Two other quick things:

1. At some point you need to figure out insurance, especially when you finally get a bunch of money.
2. Don't invest money you need to use quickly (like to buy a house).",fz5rjct,2020-07-25 11:45:05,46

dEBRUYNE_1,"Coinbase is basically the largest exchange with proper fiat on-ramps and would therefore be a great addition to the Monero ecosystem. A listing would significantly increase liquidity as well as improve ease of access. Furthermore, it would signal and confirm that Monero is not incongruent with incumbent compliance and regulatory policies.

&gt;Having Monero on coinbase will definitely pump the price

Whether we like it or not, price draws attention and is a decent method to advertise a currency. Furthermore, a larger market cap arguably leads to ecosystem growth, which will ultimately benefit all stakeholders. 

&gt;If you use Coinbase, you can be certain that all your information will be shared with shady companies and governative agencies

I think it is unreasonable to expect that this information ultimately won't be shared. The Common Reporting Standard (CRS) has been in place for several years now and one can reasonably expect for it to also apply to cryptocurrency companies in the foreseeable future. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Reporting_Standard

Using Monero is actually beneficial here, as it limits the amount of information that can be shared. Essentially, the only information shared is information related to the account at the exchange, as Monero protects the user from the exchange following transactions going forward. Brian Armstrong uses a similar line of reasoning in the What Bitcoin Did podcast:

&gt; Peter Mccormack: Are you worried about the data stored by Coinbase if the government were to become more authoritarian?

&gt;Brian Armstrong: We need to make this a technological solution, something where it can't be tracked, where you don't have to trust Coinbase. In some ways that's a more crypto-native solution. 

**Source:** https://twitter.com/sethisimmons/status/1286753615185678338

&gt;I would never suggest a Monero user to join coinbase, not when i'm aware of the fact that i would be endangering this person's privacy with my suggestion.

Signing up for any centralized exchange with mandatory KYC/AML is a privacy trade-off basically insofar as one has to share personal data in order to get account approval. However, centralized exchanges typically have significantly better liquidity and are way easier to use. We essentially need them in order for the ecosystem to be able to grow. Besides, I don't think we can expect for (i) the average Joe to use a decentralized exchange, which typically require technical competence to use and (ii) centralized exchanges being able to operate without mandatory KYC/AML (at least for higher sums) in the current regulatory climate.

&gt;I don't want Monero to be listed on Coinbase

You basically list reasons for why one should not use Coinbase, not why it would be a net negative for Monero the cryptocurrency. I've said this before, not trying to get as many listings as possible for Monero would basically be shooting ourselves in the foot.",fz6xuxf,2020-07-25 21:56:11,49

BoyScout22,"locking bitcoin in defi allows one to borrow stablecoins, which then can be used in protocols like aave, compound, balancer and others to get returns. the beauty of it is that you still benefit if bitcoin moons while you're getting interest on your stablecoins.

if you deposit your borrowed stablecoins, for example in compound, you get the interest + the COMP governance token which you can sell for additional profit, or just keep it if you think it will appreciate in the future.

once you're in defi, there are so many options and strategies....it's mind-boggling.

Tiaan,"I don't recommend Coinbase or Coinbase Pro and here's why:

When buying crypto, the main thing people want is to have access to the crypto instantly and have low fees. Unfortunately, the platforms that let you buy crypto instantly typically have higher fees. For example: coinbase and cash app are nearly 2% fee for instant buys, Swan bitcoin is 1-1.79% which is still high.

The alternative is to deposit money and wait for it to clear before buying the crypto. This can take a week or longer which is frustrating when you want to lock in a buy at the current price. To use coinbase pro, you must wait for your deposit to clear beforehand (5+ days) or wire in money ($20+ fee from most banks), and then you still must pay a 0.5% fee when trading! It's a huge ripoff.

What I suggest is to use Gemini ActiveTrader. To access this platform, you must make a Gemini account and request access to the ActiveTrader platform, which they usually grant within a day or so. This platform is like Coinbase Pro to Coinbase. The difference is that Gemini ActiveTrader gives you access to your deposited funds instantly to buy crypto with a low 0.25% trading fee. You just cannot transfer the funds out of the platform before the money clears, but at least you can lock in a buy at the current price at a fee that is 50% of coinbase pro's.",fz84a2o,2020-07-26 04:36:00,22

MashedPotatoh,"Relationships can be tough with parents.  Growing up,  I felt disconnected from my own parents.  They were old school and focused more on providing a roof than mentoring,  so I often felt like I learned a lot on my own.  After my time in the military,  I became a single father and that was when my parents really stepped in.  It strengthened the relationship I have with both of them now.  My dad and I often talk about Tesla and Bitcoin,  these are things that really interest us.  My mom and I go thrift shopping and I even helped her get her own ebay store going,  to help occupy her during retirement and bring in some extra money.  I'd consider myself the black sheep of the family since I'm always the one that struggles to find my place,  but they have both been super supportive and it's helped me move on from the childhood I didn't really understand.  

I know it's tough to open up and break down these barriers with parents,  but I hope you're given the opportunity to do so.

Looking forward to what this new day will bring and hopefully it's filled with more time in the pool,  floating in the lazy river and maybe we can sneak into the arcade.  Lol. Tonight we are making lasagna and i'll need your help to make sure it's the best &lt;3

chuck_portis,"Remember the events that led to the creation of Bitcoin.  It was in the wake of the 2008 Financial Crisis, during which:

* Governments bailed out failing big corporations with freshly printed USD
* Interest Rates were pushed to record lows to discourage saving
* The fiscal system narrowly avoided a complete collapse

Here we are more than a decade later:

* Governments are bailing out big corporations with freshly printed USD (trillions this time!)
* Interest rates have been pushed to their absolute limit @ 0%
* The fiscal system narrowly avoided a collapse in March

The problems today are much worse than in 2008.  We have propped up zombie companies, printed trillions of dollars (at an unprecedented pace), all in an attempt to keep rich pockets full.  So far, the printing has concentrated itself in equities.  Stocks are trading at record highs, despite the poor economic outlook and deterioration of fundamentals.

Inflation rates are masked by improvements in technological production.  It hides itself in assets like stocks &amp; real estate.  While the rich see their portfolios inflate, the poor who are paid and hold USD see their purchasing power diluted.  The poor &amp; now even the middle class cannot dream of purchasing a house in a desirable area.  

Inflationary currencies benefit the holders of assets (the rich).  Deflationary currencies like Bitcoin distribute wealth more evenly.  Wages are no longer diluted through dubious money printing.  Those in power would love you to believe that inflation is only measured through the price of gas and a bushel of corn.  

This is Bitcoin's chance to rise up and gain notoriety as a digitally scarce asset.  As we watch the USD begin its descent to new lows, we will realize that government policies overwhelmingly favor the rich, and people will begin to embrace new ideas &amp; technology which challenge the historical status quo on money.  

As the USD enters its freefall, the perceived risk of holding BTC will evaporate.  Instead, the risk of holding USD will quickly become apparent.  BTC will solidify itself as a safe haven.  It will be firmly seated beside Gold as a defensive asset, impervious to fiscal policy designed for &amp; by the rich.",fza7od2,2020-07-26 16:57:44,49

He thinks he is top of the food chain so doesn't put any effort into school work. Why would he? He is already the best he can be! He pushes younger 'geeky' kids around. Who knows why. Maybe he knows they are smarter and he wants to assert his dominance in some other way.

Years pass by. One day while he is serving customers at the same kiosk he has worked at since he was young, he sees one of the kids he pushed around in past. Sharp suit, swinging lambo keys around his finger. ""Hey Ethan"" he shouts. Ethan turns, smiles but continues walking.

This is still fragile.  BTC needs to clear 10250 to cement this.  By then Eth will be at the 380-400 target.  Above BTC 10500 will likely be when the hysteria starts to mount, by then ETH 500 will be close.

Last time we went from where we are now to 1400 in about 7 weeks.  If we did the same pace again then that's basically the first week or two of September.  We have more global headwinds now but Eth is going to catch the eye of a lot of dopamine addicted wallstreeters and the robinhood crowd/retail.  Institutional onramps and custody is more established.  ETH has more regulatory clarity.  Not to mention Eth2 deploying.  We got to 1400 playing second fiddle to bitcoin.

just_say_n,"I’ve been reading John Mauldine’s letters for years.  He’s a talented and interesting writer who distills complex issues from many credible sources.  That said, he’s never been good at predicting anything—and has been saying that the market is overvalued for as long as I’ve been reading his letters.

This letter was no different—he even goes on to say that he thinks it’s a bad time to buy stocks “for the long term” and that you can expect a much more attractive “entry price” in the near future. This is not new. A few years ago he was advocating being in cash as an “option” to buy equities at lower prices.

Who knows if this time he’ll be right—but you’d have not been a winner banking on his timing in the past.  

That said, I fully agree that we have inflation in equities, but also housing/real estate and other assets (gold, after all, hit a new high and Bitcoin is back above $10K).

That doesn’t mean much, however.  Inflation is, if anything, a way of saying that your money is worth less now than it was yesterday.  

Ok, so?  Does that mean that, because we have inflation, we are also “overvalued” and, more to John’s point, that prices will “deflate”?

Of course not.  So yes, I’ll concede there’s been “inflation” of various assets, including stocks, but that doesn’t mean much besides that it now takes more dollars to buy the same quantity and value of stocks than it did yesterday.",fzez31d,2020-07-28 01:04:17,37

bergs007,"The topic of whether to invest in VTHO or VET has come up quite often in these Daily Threads, and I always argue in favor of VET.   However, I've never had a top-level post where I can organize all of my thoughts since I have always been in the position of responding to someone else's argument.  Therefore, here is a summary of why I think VET is the better investment vehicle.

First, let's start with a discussion of what it takes to run a crypto network.   A blockchain network isn't free to run; and in fact, a large part of the reason that it works is *because* it costs money to write transactions.  The people that run the network need to be incentivized to process transactions or else they would drop out of the network.  That is why Bitcoin pays miners to process transactions on the network.  The Bitcoin network pays its miners in Bitcoin, which is the main coin on the network that represents value.

&amp;#x200B;

In the footsteps of Bitcoin, Ethereum (the first smart contract platform) also decided to use a one-coin model for their platform.  This means that the same coin (named ETH) that provides payment to the transaction processors is also the same coin that investors use to invest in the network.

&amp;#x200B;

As the network gains participants and services, the utility-based value of the network grows as well.  As the utility-based value of the network grows, it gains attention and more people want their share of this utility-based value.  They purchase ETH in the hopes that the network will be more valuable in the future. These people are termed speculators because they are speculating on the future utility of the network.

In this manner, the utility-based value and the speculation-based value combine with the help of the market to set the trading price of the ETH coin.  As the value of the network rises, the price of ETH rises; and as the price of ETH rises, so does the cost to perform a transaction on the network.  As such, there is *strong* correlation between the value of the network and the cost of performing a transaction on the network.  Since price discovery is often volatile, this means that the transaction costs are also volatile, due to their *strong* correlation.

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's talk about where the value from a blockchain platform originates.  Let's say that a company receives 20 cents of value (either from supply chain management cost savings or customer trust or any other measures of value) out of being able to track their mushrooms on the blockchain.  This means that they will be willing to pay up to 20 cents in order to do so, but anything over that means they are losing money.  Hence, it behooves the blockchain platform to keep the total transaction costs for that product under 20 cents, or else they stand to lose this business as a customer.

With a single token system, this means that the more money investors put into the token, the more these mushrooms will cost in order to track.  The unfortunate effect of the single token system is that the more popular a platform becomes, the more expensive it is to transact on the system.  Wouldn't it be nice to have a blockchain platform where this isn't the case?  Wouldn't be nice if there was *zero* correlation between the value of a network and the cost of performing a transaction on that network?  Wouldn't it be nice if the value of the network could fluctuate wildly and the cost of performing a transaction was kept extremely stable?

&amp;#x200B;

VeChain understood this issue and they are attempting to solve it.  VeChain, in their two-token system, decided to split the gas token (VTHO) used to pay transaction processors apart from the main network token (VET).  The gas token (VTHO) is designed to represent the utility-based value that enterprises will receive from performing a transaction, while the speculative token (VET) is free to accumulate money from investors (aka speculators).  The system is designed to divorce the two, so that transaction costs are kept stable regardless of the current valuation of the network.

One way to think of this is to treat VTHO like a commodity and VET like a stock.  If you imagine a commodity like soybeans, they get their value from being able to provide energy.  If a kilogram of soybeans can, for instance, feed 10 people for 10 days, then a company can set their price for a kilogram of soybeans based on how much 10 people are willing to pay to stay alive for 10 days.  Likewise, if a 'kilogram' of VTHO can track 10 suppliers' product lines of mushrooms for 10 days, then the price for a 'kilogram' of VTHO should be in the same ballpark as the value that those 10 companies receive for being able to track mushrooms for 10 days.  There is some room to speculate on this value, but the companies themselves know how much value they get out of tracking their mushrooms.  This means that if the price of tracking the mushrooms gets too high, then customers will no longer utilize the service.

On the other side of things, you can think of VET like a stock.  It represents ownership in the VeChain platform.  If you think that the VeChain platform is going to do well in the future, then you should invest in VET because it gives you the rights to a share of the wealth that the platform represents.  You can speculate all sorts of reasons why VET will accumulate value in the future.  You can speculate that the foundation will raise the generation rate of VTHO, which will increase the dividend that each VET gets.  You can speculate that companies will have to purchase VET in order to generate their own VTHO, and that demand will raise the price of VET.  You can speculate that consumers will come to trust the VeChain platform and give more business to companies that utilize it.  The VET token is designed to attract all of this speculative investment.

If you assess the two tokens in this manner, then you must come to the conclusion that the VeChain Foundation will want the VTHO token's price to represent its utility-based value as closely as possible, while carrying as little speculative-based value as possible.  Contrariwise, the VET token's value should absorb as much of the speculative value of the network as possible.  This isn't to say that VTHO will not have any speculative value whatsoever.  After all, soybeans do have a futures market, so if VTHO is listed in the market place, then it will attract speculators.  However, I believe that since VTHO is designed to act like a commodity and VET is designed to act like a stock, VET will attract the lion's share of the speculative investment.  In the context of this analogy, I'd much rather invest in the soybean company than in the soybeans themselves.

So, in summary, I feel like the appreciation in value of the network will flow into VET and not into VTHO; and that is why investing in VET is the more logical choice.

I'm more than open to discuss this, so if you see any holes in my argument, please let me know.",fzfcdgq,2020-07-28 02:50:11,30

Kesuke,"There's a few distinct issues here;

1. The search
2. The damage to the door
3. The confiscation of the Bitcoin mining setup
4. Damage to one of the mining machines

**The search itself**: I think you appreciate it was entirely justified. They had solid evidence to suggest there maybe a drug cultivation operation occuring and they conducted a raid on that basis.

**The damage to the door**: This is more complex. Police forces DO sometimes make payments in compensation for damage that occurs entering a property. HOWEVER... if the search was lawful (which we've established above is almost certainly the case) then you are unlikely to get much further without going via a solicitor which will probably rack up more costs than the door itself.

**The mining setup**: This is where I think you may have a stronger argument. You'll need to talk to your son and figure out how much this is likely to cost you in ""lost income"". If we are talking big sums of money because he has somehow found a way to make mining profitable (vs the electricity and equiptment costs).

The argument here would rest on the basis that the confiscation of the machines was unlawful (and by extension so also was the damage sustained to the one machine)... everyone has computers in their house, it is 2020... so unless they specifically had reason to believe there was child pornography this seems like they've acted excessively on the basis of the evidence that prompted the search? The police do have broad powers to seize things they believe may be involved in crime though and this would be at the very crux of the legal argument.

You would need to make a claim that they have therefore acted negligently by confiscating the machines (in excess of the warrant) and in the process of that negligence you have suffered damages (both material in the damaged machine and in terms of lost income). I have no idea if any of this would stand up to close scrutiny but one thing I can say is you'll never get them to admit that the confiscation was negligent... you'll absolutely have to go via an IPCC complaint and you'll probably need a solicitor. The very fact that they have done this is probably a reflection of the fact they were left red-faced, as they busted into your house expecting to uncover a major drug ring - only to realize it was a perfectly legal suburban household with a good reason for a hot loft.

As a general piece of advice; the police search houses every day... this is their bread and butter. Whilst there is a lot to be said about their understanding of the law, they do generally act within it because if they're doing this every day then sooner rather than later they are going to get pulled up if they operate outside their remit. As a result, taking the police to court over negligence claims can be very difficult.

biggie_dd,"&gt;If I were to idly speculate they may have believed some involvement in something illicit due to bitcoin often being linked to the drug trade. So they've gone there for drugs, and found something often connected to drugs, so have seized them until they bottom it out. That's speculation though. 

Cash is often linked to drug trades as well. If they had £200 out on the counter (say, because they were expecting a repairman to fix the washing machine, or something similar, and completely legit), is that up for grabs for the police too? Or a few bags of potting soil and plant nutrient solution, which OP bought to re-pot their flowers?  Or if they have one of those shelf-sized hydroponics kits, which is obviously too small to grow cannabis, but has a grow light in it? 

The whole reasoning is wrong here. ""Oh, we found no signs of any drug related operations, except for a completely legal way of generating a pretty much everyday used form of money, because on a long stretch, it could be used for buying drugs, so we confiscated all"". With that sentiment, why not also take all valuable items from the home, since those could also be sold for drugs?

I’m still shocked that some of the same tropes and misconceptions are still lingering (Bitcoin = blockchain; why does the currency have value; Libra didn’t succeed, neither will blockchain! Companies will make their own “closed” blockchains, like it’s 2018; Etc.).

There were a few people in there who were open minded and discussed genuinely. Some others not so much. Overall, we are indeed *very* early if an “investing” sub is this closed minded.

Fun fact: back when the Baseline conference was happening a few months back, I posted the /u/pbrody stream to that sub and was actually permanently *banned*. After discussing back and forth with a mod, he reduced it to a shorter timeframe. But part of the reason why I posted it there is because Baseline is exactly the kind of thing I’d want to learn about if I was a stock trader. It’s basically a sleeper use case for tons of the companies those people are investing in. I feel like enterprise blockchain use of the public chain will have a similar adoption story to cloud computing (it’ll be slow at first but then become all the rage, all at once). Even if I didn’t want to buy crypto, and just stick to stocks, I’d want to know about Baseline.

From my standpoints, it seems it is more about the idea of money being independent and not regulated by the government than about an actual use of the coin. I have no idea why should I get BTC except for speculation purpose and how the hell is it supposed to become a gold standard with its alternating price. There u have ETH, for example, ready to be innovative and change to suit the needs of the people. Holding ETH also seems to have more practical value with the DEFI.

Bitcoin1776,"I know it's unpopular opinion on the sub, but I have the goal of getting as much as I can, sensibly.

So *frankly* I don't hodl. I do trade some, make business investments, etc. I think I spent like $10,000 on random mailers and billboard type ads in my city - but these are crazy fucking mailers, not *btc is cool* mailers, but like 'the end is nigh, get Bitcoin' type mailers, haha.

I've invested in some startups, made a shit load Bitcoin off that. I hope to be doing my own (true) startups soon (book, edu business, etc) and to make more Bitcoin off that. Everything I do costs Bitcoin.

My currency is Bitcoin. I pay Venezuelans in Bitcoin for cheap high quality work. I measure my wealth in Bitcoin, and feel bad when I don't have enough, more. I'm WELL OVER 100% invested into Bitcoin, like 'mortgage your house to buy Bitcoin' type invested.

But I did regret not having more money on Robinhood to play 'guess the stocks' during the pandemic. And I got burned during the 50% one-day crash, cause I had a (very weak) margin position that said Bitcoin wouldn't drop 70% - and it went from $13,000 to $3,300 - when Oil went from $70 to neg $10.

But I got more, and now I'm back at my original stack, from like 2 years ago.

I hope to never 'hodl' Bitcoin, I just want the Bitcoins. Like, lots of them.

It's a fucking insane game we're playing. If you got a huge opportunity (like investing $15k to go to Lambda School for 1 year to make $100k for multiple years thereafter), do it. In today's world, you can start a business with small money, and get huge residuals. I know a lady with a writing service making $150k per year, after just 3 years, doing no work (outsourcing it all) - with like $15k initial investment.

---

If you are a Bitcoin'er, earning $100,000 per year, buying $50,000 more Bitcoin per year... or using other techniques to gain Bitcoin, that is good - always, always get more Bitcoin.

Bitcoin might annualize at 100% per year returns or 20%, but there are peaks and troughs. I'm no day trader, but I will sell a few percents, and place buy orders here and there - but multi year trades are a good move, IMO (loading up now, reducing later, etc).

---

The Bitcoin inflation rate is approaching the magic number. If you call all Bitcoin'ers 'investors', they have to cumulative earn 2% returns *more than* Bitcoin, to purchase all the new Bitcoins. Granted, that's hard in times like these, where Bitcoin is skyrocketing, but like...

Well. I won't go through the math, but I'll just say we are nearing *perma bull* territory.

Set a goal of increasing your BTC holdings by 10% this year, and you will have purchased *your share* of Bitcoin inflation for the next 4 years...

That's what I mean. It's getting easy to perma - self perpetuate. And that to me is a good hodl'r - one who buys more Bitcoin than the year before. One who makes quick investments to get more Bitcoin. One who labors wisely to get Bitcoin. One who eats up all the Bitcoin.

[This business](http://sporeworks.com/) accepts Bitcoin (and other crypto). They never sell their coinage, ever. I did that. Many coins removed from circulation.

Gobble gobble gobble the Bitcoins. It's not a game of bragging rights, it's a game of eat 'em up, and beat 'em up. We got to get all the Bitcoins. 1.3 Mil coins in the next 4 years. Be the hungry hippo my friend, we got lots of work to do. Stay busy, get coin.

almkglor,"This is not a security loss, but it is a potential privacy loss.  If you spend it with other addresses, then that links that address with your other addresses, allowing chain analysis to get more accurate data on wallets.

The proper response is to spend the 0.0001 coin on a charity.  Pirate Bay, Wikipedia, WikiLeaks, Free Software Foundation, etc.  This prevents you from accidentally combining the coin with other coins you control and thus preventing anyone from exploiting this address attack to determine the other addresses of your wallet

(Knowing your addresses does not let anyone steal from you, but you probably do not want anyone from knowing how much money you are HODLing: how rich you are is your business, not anyone else's)

Unfortunately, most hardware wallet web interface (which is what your screenshot looks like) do not have coin control.  Sending out a 0.0001 coin might very well select a *different* coin.  So don't do that using your hardware wallet web interface (you should really avoid the hardware wallet web interface, since it leaks your entire HODLings to the hardware wallet manufacturer).

Fortunately, Electrum **does** have coin control, and recent Electrum versions support most of the popular hardware wallets (to my knowledge it supports Ledger, Trezor, and KeepKey; I have actually used Electrum with Trezor).

In Electrum there is a ""Coins"" tab (if it doesn't appear, look for the ""View"" menu at the top and select ""Show Coins"").  Once Electrum syncs you should be able to identify this 0.0001 coin.  Select the coin (and ***only*** that coin), right-click, and select ""Spend"", then send the max amount to your favorite BTC-accepting charity (Electrum will auto-deduct its fee estimate from the coin).

(You should probably use Electrum in general since it has a good mix of features, though note you are still sending all your addresses to Electrum servers.  You can run your own Bitcoin Core and Electrum server (such as Electrum Personal Server, which is very minimal additional load on top of Bitcoin Core) if you want better privacy, and use Electrum exclusively with your hardware wallet and avoid the hardware wallet web interface.)",fzl8scs,2020-07-29 13:25:13,18

TheGreatMuffin,"It's a bitcoin full node. A bitcoin wallet needs a full node in order to know which transactions happened on the network. If you don't use your own node, you (your wallet) are using someone else's node, with all the implications for your privacy and trust assumptions.  

A full node is a software that verifies your bitcoin transactions for you (implicitly it also verifies the overall supply of bitcoin, protects you from fraud from third parties, from ""fake"" bitcoin etc) and gives you a higher level of privacy (you don't leak sensitive information to your wallet's nodes, f.ex).  

Here's a great explainer by P. Wuille (although it doesn't even mention the privacy benefits):  

&gt; One of Bitcoin's strengths - the most important in my opinion even - is the low degree of trust you need in others.   
&gt;  
&gt;    
&gt; If you use a full node for your incoming transactions, you know that there was no cheating anytime in the history of your coins:  
&gt;  
&gt; * Nobody ever created money out of nothing (except for mimers, and only according to a well-defined schedule).  
&gt; 
&gt; * Nobody ever spent coins without holder their private key.  
&gt; 
&gt; * Nobody spent the same coins twice (but see further).  
&gt; 
&gt; * Nobody violated any of the other tricky rules that are needed to keep the system in check (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, ...).  
&gt; 
&gt; ... with one exception: because there is a need to pick a winner in presence of multiple competing valid versions of the ledger, (a majority of) miners have the authority to pick the version of the block chain that wins. This means their power is limited to choosing the order in which otherwise valid transactions occur, up to and including the right to delay them indefinitely. But they cannot make invalid transaction look valid to a full node.  
&gt;  
&gt; If you are not running a full node, the amount of trust you're placing in others increases.  
&gt; 
&gt; SPV nodes (such as some mobile clients, and Multibit) place a blind trust in the majority of miners, without checking validity of the blockchain they produce. It still requires a majority of miners to mislead an SPV node, but they can make it believe anything (including ""You received 10000000 BTC!""). The reason why this does not happen is because full nodes would not accept such blocks, and assuming a large portion of the ecosystem does rely on full nodes, miners who do this would not see their blocks accepted by the larger economy, resulting in them wasting money.  
&gt;  
&gt; Centralized services (most webwallets) make the user trust whatever the site says. They can claim anything.
&gt;  
&gt; So I hope you now see the importance of full nodes in this model. If you run a full node somewhere on the network, and nobody looks at the transactions it validates, it is indeed contributing to the network, but it is not helping with the reduction of trust.  
&gt;  
&gt; Look at it another way: if only a few large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem were running full nodes, it only requires a malicious intent, or an attack/threat against them, to change the system's rules, as nobody else is validating.  
&gt;  
&gt; Doing transactions in the Bitcoin ecosystem helps the Bitcoin currency. Running a full node helps the network. Using a full node helps you and the ecosystem reduce the need for trust.

Maybe since when you and most people (including me) first bought. However, NANO (formerly XRB) is still up over 10x against Bitcoin since March 2017 and well over 100x against the USD. Still way better than most alts. I think people should measure altcoin performance across cycles, and I don't think we've seen the next market cycle yet. If anything, we're only in the beginning. And there's still the whole possibility that crypto is just part of the global asset bubble.

hodlDRGN,"# LEVEL 5 - SECURITY INTERCHAIN BLOCKCHAIN

A Level 5 node will provide a bridge to one or more public blockchains and allow clients to interact with them (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, etc.).

An important feature that this would provide is that of checkpointing, or placing a hash of an artifact for “proof of existence” on a public blockchain. For checkpointing operations, the Level 5 node will accept a transaction, a block verification of any level, an arbitrary string, or an arbitrary hash. The argument will be hashed and this hash added to a transaction placed on the public blockchain(s). The existence of this hash can be used to prove that the artifact was in existence and at a certain state using public blockchain data. An organization may use this proof to measure and mitigate risk based upon the estimate or calculation of hash power expanded since that time (in the case of a proof of work blockchain). For example, a $2 Million transaction may be passed to a Level 5 node to be placed as soon as possible on the Bitcoin blockchain, and at some point in time later, a party may use that information as a source to measure the amount of hashpower that has been expanded since that time, calculate the probability that an attacker could successfully counterfeit that Bitcoin block given a particular percentage of global hashpower, and extrapolate or estimate the cost to expend that hashpower (as well as the sacrifice of hardware and/or currency due to network collapse). If this process results in a risk evaluation that is satisfactory to the business, the transaction can be trusted and accepted.

Another important aspect of the public bridge functionality is the ability to track assets between the private and public side. That is, given an internal currency implemented to use Bitcoin addresses (see currency section elsewhere in this document), a token may be issued on Bitcoin using public APIs or services and this token may live in both the private blockchain and the Bitcoin public blockchain. Owners of the keys or wallet would be able to transfer the token or asset with either public or private blockchain interactions. The Level 5 node may be used to track this asset between the blockchains as well as keep them in sync with each other.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This system seems entirely external to Ethereum apart from writing some data on chain at the end of the day (as one of many chains), is that correct?

Though it may seem this way, Ethereum is leveraged in many different ways. Some of it is explained in the proposal, such as the compatibility with any and all Ethereum based wallets and applications, as well as the Interchain. Dragonchain also runs their own Ethereum node. They're blockchain and currency agnostic, but as explained it makes most sense to leverage Ethereum for the many advantages, security, and ongoing active development it has to offer, while simultaneously be interoperable with any and all legacy systems and or other blockchains for flexibility and adoption reasons, and much more. I **highly recommend** reading [this extensive article from BitBuyTheCoin](https://den.social/l/Dragonchain/09f09bdf58fc4856a7bb378c26a15ef2/blockchain-interoperability-is-solved-with-interchain/) as I can never explain it any better myself.

&gt;You emphasize that Disney helped start it yet (I think) they’re not involved at this point, at least as not as much as they used to be, why?

It took Joe Roets and the team great efforts and lengths to open source from The Walt Disney Company, and as of right now the history is the only active connection, and the team itself has always made this very clear. 

The history there is that, many years ago Disney called Joe Roets, and relocated him and his family to Seattle, to build what was then called the Disney Private Blockchain Platform inside the company. 

''When I got the call from Disney, that’s when I was, okay that’s a company that has so many potential use cases, I would be a little freer to really test out this architecture right. And so they moved my family up to Seattle, and there’s a Seattle office, and we started building out the core Dragonchain infrastructure. And we started trying to figure out who would want to try it? Hackathons, and things like that. And we got a lot of people calling us out to ask, does this crazy idea makes sense? And for me as an architect the whole point of the exercise was to throw the architecture up against the rocks. And see where it broke, and to see what feedback we got. And that was the really important part because we found a lot of things that we hadn’t expected. Nothing broke because it was a very effectively flexible architecture, but there were things that we were able to add because once we realized oh they want to do this which we could do, we could do this thing over here, and we continued to do that, even with the the commercial platform. And everything else that we’re constantly finding new capabilities and new possibilities for products''. 

In the limited Open Source Money documentary product by Vision Tree, aired on Discovery Science Channel in the US, some insights were provided as to why the open source route was taken later on. And the documentation provided above shows how near impossible it is to open source something from The Walt Disney Company, though they have had plenty of other great open source projects coming out of them for the same reasons. 

In his communication with the community, Joe always made clear that open sourcing this technology is the only way, and the right way to succeed. ""Releasing the source code to the public was always part of our plan,"" said Joe Roets, founder and CEO of Dragonchain. ""With this release, we believe the potential impact can be maximized by the blockchain community, offering opportunities for developers and driving more real use cases in the blockchain space.''

Now I think it's safe to say that Bitcoin dropping back below $3k is never going to happen. But that's like 3 years later that I feel confident saying that.

In my opinion, this is still not a good reason to avoid leveraging on someone else's work, particularly if someone else had done a great job already.

More than that, it is surprisingly to me that Bitcoin ABC has no problem with implementing a bunch of codes from Bitcoin Core over the years (but has problems with implementing Jonathan Toomin's code). They are not consistent in their actions and this is the part that bothers me.

If Bitcoin ABC has difficulty in getting resources to do improvements for Bitcoin Cash, I am fairly confident that we can ask Bitcoin Cash Node to do all (or maybe most of) the work to make Bitcoin ABC's life easier, so that Bitcoin ABC can backport the codes from BCHN rather than Bitcoin Core (especially so because the Bitcoin ABC software is closer to BCHN than Bitcoin Core's software). This would be so much better for Bitcoin Cash in terms of progress and improvements.",fzogyu9,2020-07-30 09:34:06,9

tjkix2006,"Don't know if people already know or card (probably not but them brigading that post on r/ethereum piqued my interest), but I read DragonChain's white paper (it's called ""architecture"" so I don't know if it is the actual white paper). I understand why there is no short description for it, it is very convoluted and the papesr is vague and pretty hard to read and understand in a meaningful way. But from one I got from it, it is completely centralized and Ethereum (or other blockchains) only act as a way of doing ""check-ins"" which is really just a hash of their chain data and cannot be used without DragonChain at all. Just the receipt. The structure of the ""chain"" itself is also very questionable and is made up of 4/5 layers (they have a graphic outlining this but it seems like the lines are pointing in the wrong direction showing data flowing from L4 -&gt; L1, but everything else indicates the other way around is true):

1. Nodes run by individuals (or groups) to serve a single need, this is where the smart contracts run. The contract receives a header (meta data), signature, and payload. The payload is used to run the contract and is striped before the block is generated. These transactions are received and approved or denied based on the payload and the smart contracts.
2. This layer receives blocks of transactions (valid and invalid) from L1 and verifies that them (signature and what not) and creates a new ""block"" and signs it with a hash of the previous to create a trusted blockchain between nodes.
3. This layer gets the ""blocks"" from multiple (all?) L2's and verifies that it has received the  blocks from enough L2 nodes, ""business units"", and  ""key authorities"" (seems like these keys would be verified against L2 nodes so seems redundant). Not much is given here so it is really hard to know what the difference between these three ""verifications"" are and how they aren't the same. At the end of all of this another blockchain is formed here by signing with a hash of the previous block. It seems like this and L2 could easily be combined, but I guess this is used instead of creating a consensus model on L2?
4. Called the notary, basically third parties take the data from L3 and sign it themselves to verify it exists and they received it.
5. The public checkpoint. This is where ETH comes in (or other chains). Basically a hash of of their private blockchains are kept on public chain. They also say it could be used to currency because they suggest using addresses similar to Bitcoin, but this is not explained and I doubt it is built into the codebase. Also, what is stopping somebody from moving ETH/BTC from an address that matches one on the DragonChain? Obviously nothing. So this leads me to believe that you would have to have your own BTC/ETH node and build something to monitor this.

So overall, it seems like a basic, but convoluted blockchain that gives you some bare bones infrastructure that *could* do a lot with, but you have to build everything yourself that it could do and build it especially for DragonChain. The fact that it is so convoluted would make it hard to work with and having 3 different types of nodes also seems less manageable.

I looked at the code a little but don't have time to do a deep dive but from their Github it seems inactive so I'm assuming the chain is underdeveloped. Also, it is built in Python, so slow.

Immature technology and the use of Ethereum is essentially moot because it is so inconsequential and non-reliant. Also, WHY DO THEY SELL COINS? Everything they offer is for businesses with closed, trusted setups. License the technology and advise, absolutely no reason to have coins.

I'll probably edit this with additional quotes as I read this but the first one that stands out is this:

""An analogy is that investing in bitcoin today is akin to investing in Facebook when it had 50 
million users with the potential to grow to the more than 2 billion users it has today""

Edit:

The majority of the paper is what I would call Bitcoin 101. It's followed up about current issues of the pandemic and de-globalization and their affects on bitcoin's price and adoption.

It discusses the investment made by Paul Tudor and how that was a watershed moment to open the door for other hedge funds.

One section I found interesting was related to millennials; as follows:

""Great wealth transfer

A report released by Coldwell Banker in October 2019 shared data around the transfer of $68 trillion in 
wealth to millennials, estimated to be one of the most substantial transfers of wealth historically. The 
study also found that there are almost 620,000 millennial millionaires in the United States, about 2% 
of the population of millionaires in the U.S. The millennial demographic (those born between 1981 to 
1996) is more open to novel, digitally native alternatives versus legacy products and services and more 
comfortable holding new types of investments. 
This open-mindedness has been shaped in part by the 2008 financial crisis. Entering the workforce 
at such an inopportune time instilled a level of skepticism towards the traditional banking system. 
According to WEF’s 2017 Global Shapers Survey, 45% of the 30,000 millennials surveyed said they 
disagree with the statement that they trust banks to be fair and honest.xiii Edelman’s October 2018 
survey of affluent millennials (those aged 24-38 with $50K in investable assets or $100K in individual or 
joint income) found that 77% of affluent millennials believe “the whole financial system is designed to 
favor the rich and powerful” and that “it’s just a matter of time before the bad behavior of the financial 
industry leads us into another global financial crisis.”xiv
There is also evidence that the millennial demographic’s affinity to hold bitcoin relative to legacy stores 
of value such as gold is high. According to Nate Geraci, president of investment advisor, ETF Store, 
anecdotally, about 90% of their millennial clients said they prefer bitcoin to goldxv - “It’s a landslide.” 
According to a November 2019 Millennials and the Future of Money report by Edelman, 63% of “crypto 
users” said crypto is a better investment than gold in a volatile economy""

The final sentence of the conclusion goes :

""Bitcoin’s strength is that it has properties that allow it to serve multiple functions, further hardening the likelihood of its success as measured by growth in value.""

This is a good paper to read, especially for some newer folks here, but interesting tidbits of information for those at all levels.",fzrfvmk,2020-07-31 04:02:01,10

63db346d,"* There is no built in pyramid scheme in IOTA, the whole infrastructure doesn't induce the systemic slavery of the poor
* unlike mining/staking pools, the project aims at true decentralization, the consensus quorum in IOTA 2.0 is going to be much higher than other Blockchain projects
* IOTA's vision is future proof: if there are better technological options in the future for improvements, IOTA can adopt them. The users and the service providers of the system are not in conflict of interest, there is no reason to not adopt better tech for IOTA
* strong academic background: the IOTA Foundation (IF) works together with some of the most significant universities in Europe, those universities dedicate lots of resources to IOTA. And also the research team at the IF is extremely strong (take a look at this tweet  https://twitter.com/billatnapier/status/1260691063339188231?s=20 )
* the IF really knows well how to present stuff in a visually appealing way (which is quite important for the adoption of the technology imho)
* standardization of IOTA as the default DLT solution world wide is already on its way with pretty significant players like the Object Management Group, Eclipse Foundation and Linux Foundation. IOTA already translates to prestige in the open source scene.
* the community behind IOTA is organic and real, visionary people are behind IOTA, the community is extremely strong and its full of builders. Even the critics watching over the project closely are well educated and are permanently questioning every minor decision. Alone according to the community size, we could easily says that IOTA deserves to be in top 10
* unlike Bitcoin, IOTA has no inflation and no fees, in my eyes it is going to be the first truly decentralized cryptocurrency without utilizing any shenanigans to be kept alive. 
* While to some degree you can call most coins an ""Altcoin"" of Bitcoin, IOTA is far more than just a cryptocurrency, its the first of its kind, it is there to not only secure value transactions, but also zero-value transactions, which is definitively a game changer and obviously a huge factor in its adoption so far
* all those hundreds of patents mentioning IOTA from fortune 500 companies, all those crazy partnerships are only confirming that the industry already sees the value in IOTA in its primitive alpha version form and they invest money and resources in it.
* the price is almost in all time low, perfect timing for investing, especially considering that after years of research, the first prototypes for a Coordinator-less IOTA are finally there, and the TestNets look very promising. 
* by having reusable addresses and sub 10 second transactions soon with the Chrysalis update big exchanges are going to be able to integrate IOTA way easier
* the IOTA Foundation is always one step ahead of the game, they already have plans for extreme scalability with a wonderful sharding concept, and there are advancements like the multiverse approach promising multiple magnitudes of more scalability. They always got some secret weapons ;)
* the project has an extremely clean start, the IF is registered as non-profit foundation in Germany, the initial crowd sale was extremely fair, no shady things like reserved supply etc. This is not a VC project. They achieved all this with only $500k. A clean start and a clean history matter A LOT. The IF got its IOTA's from donations after the initial crowd sale, they didn't keep anything to themselves
* the IOTA Foundation is very strong with about 100 extremely skilled people working making IOTA happen, yet, although they got probably a huge burn rate, they already have many different income streams, and the IF is on its way to completely become independent of selling its IOTA's.
* the IOTA foundation is strongly supported by EU, you can clearly see that if you pay attention, see the CityXChange project as a quick example
* the IF as well as the builders in the community are not scared to try new things out. No risk, no fun, those guys understand very well what science is about, what invention is about, they don't copy paste like the remaining 99% of all other projects in the scene but they try to build novel technologies instead.
* the IF is permanently in communication with industry players and tries to understand their needs and solve real world problems. See eclipse work group TangleEE in this context https://tangle.ee/

Those were just the points which instantly came into my mind, there is still soooo much to tell, I could go on and on, but I am getting tired :D Maybe see https://iotaarchive.com/ for more reasons why to invest in IOTA and to make up your own opinion.

* the most important reason why to invest in IOTA for me personally is the hope to leave a better future for the world and for my son",fzs4ll4,2020-07-31 05:42:43,9
BubblyJoe,"This isn't just a nano problem imo. 

Over a million subscribers and you have like 8 mods. Hello? Mods have definately been biased against many coins and they should probably publically announce % of what coins they have and whether or not they work in crypto/finance whatever.

The daily discussions are kinda pointless today I realized. Either this pumps blah blah, scam coin blah, occasionally links to articles are posted but will see deleted comments a lot. Little discussion and mostly bashing.

What if there was a public wiki about each coin and how they have been attacked, pros, cons, etc? Iota shutdown for a day, Verge 51% attack, rgb secret 51% attack (?), ravencoin (a coin I like and hold) overprinting possibly purposely, the list goes on.

Also the funny part about nano is that it is a working product. How many working products do you see in top 100 or 200? Oh and that are NOT stable coins, exchange coins etc.

Even at this point what if I said I'm all in on bitcoin? Am I shill now? It moves slower than dirt, will never see transactions below $1 again, lightning network been in development since at least 2017, HUGE waste of energy (made some localish residents very upset when their electricty rates double/trippled). Bitcoin might be the biggest, but its development is god awful.

Lastly the content of the subreddit. Literally dogshit. Posts that are all single digits except the 2-3 big news for the last 2-3 days. Look at just about any other subreddit with 1 million subscribers. Way more upvotes and/or comments. If your gonna play political games as moderator and controlling what people see your going to just end up driving people away and the place will not be able to grow and discuss more.

As non-programmer and non-finance, I find the space fairly hard to understand and would love to learn more. Like I like mimblewimble, want to learn if UBT is scam or something complex. But its hard when everything in the space is small and there are scammer shills going around. But LMAO if your gonna call nano a scam and lolly just cause it's down 97%.

Will each phase work as intended until ETH 2.0 (incl. sharding) is fully functional? Will there be more delays? ETH is promising because it can do so much more than just be a coin to transfer value, but it's also less certain. PoS and sharding would be great milestones and prove that ETH can evolve. Unlike BTC, where the technically conservative community can't even agree on a modest increase of the blocksize.

tlztlz,"That's good questions. We were all there at some point. No need for excuse.

You want to sell your car. 10k. Who sets the price? You? Nope the buyer. If nobody wants your car for 10k but they will buy for 8k, you have to lower your price or your car will rot in your garage. Same with any product. Also Bitcoin.

Can it fall to zero? Not likely. Because when the price is 0.00000000000001 I *will buy all bitcoin*. The problem is, my friend will buy at 0.00000000000002 and so on. See? But it can, it will like it did multiple times drop significantly.  But on the long term side it goes up like a rocket. So instead of trying to time the market, it's more important to be in the market long-term.

Who controls it? Everybody is. You are if you do it properly. This is the power of Bitcoin. **NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR BITCOIN**  
You can store it on an exchange, but technically it's not your Bitcoin. They can block your account, they can be hacked etc. Happens all the time. If you are in control of your keys. And you safeguard them properly, nobody can take it away from you. The keys are like the password for your bank account. If you send them over the internet, type it in on a website, mail it? Bye bye money. So you have to store them offline. A hardware wallet like ledger nano, Trezor or my favourite is bitbox02.

Here are some good video resources to go deeper. Welcome to the rabbit hole. 😄

&gt;Ethereum vs #Bitcoin. Looks impressive with 2.16 Billion dollars 'locked' (nice ponzi mechanic, supply lock = price moon for ETH right?)

&gt;The biggest ETH DeFi dApp Compound has 967 users. 

&gt;Locked $ / users = $700,000 per ""user."" ETH DeFi users = traders

Notice how rapidly the stupidity stacks up:

- Inexplicable quote-marks around 'locked' to insinuate... what, exactly? That the smart contract has risks? That the value isn't truly locked but rather can be accessed in minutes? But why bother with precise, verifiable statements when it's easier to snark aimlessly?

- Here's a ""fact"" ($700,000 USD per Compound user)

- Here's a casual conflation of all DeFi with a single component thereof (Compound isn't even the top DeFi provider in total funds, that's Maker!)

- Here's a random assertion (lock-ups = ponzi mechanic, which seems to imply that **all** collateralized loans are ponzis)

- Here's an extremely poor extrapolation from the previous ""fact"" (ETH DeFi users = traders)

Somebody [graciously lets the guy know how DappRadar works](https://twitter.com/bax1337/status/1281253345131245569), because reading is hard: the #'s represent total users that interacted with the contract within a specific time-frame. His ""fact"" neglects that he's using the number of Compound users in the last 24 hours.

Lesson being, OBVIOUSLY, IF YOU SPEND EVEN HALF A SECOND ACTUALLY THINKING INSTEAD OF SEARCHING FOR ANY GARBAGE THAT BACKS UP EXISTING PREJUDICES, that **these time-bound metrics are extremely poor proxies for total users**.

So of course [the guy immediately repeats the exact same mistake, but with the number of users through the last 7 days](https://twitter.com/bradmillscan/status/1281301993752080385).

Academic_Crypto,"I haven't posted or visited this sub in a while, but I see a  lot of people who are confused about the market micro-structure right now, so what I am going to do here is describe what is happening in the market atm.

The first thing to point out is that the open interest (OI) on derivatives products is relatively very high right now ([image](https://imgur.com/Pl6UgNX)), and this isn't even considering the options markets. Currently this figure is about 5 billion USD, and approximately the same as the top that formed in February of this year. There are essentially two kinds of products at comprise this open interest, there is (1) perpetual futures which do not have a settlement date and instead have a funding rate that is paid either continuously or every 8 hours and track the spot price and (2) settled futures which do no have a funding rate and incur a premium to spot assets.

A year or two ago these futures products existed primarily just for Bitcoin, but in the last year they have been increasingly offered and utilized for other crypto assets as well. The main exchanges where these are traded are BitMEX, OKex, Huobi, Binance, FTX, ByBit, Deribit, Bitfinex.

A question that I see confounding a lot of people is ""Who are the actors that own the long and short side of these record breaking levels of contracts?"". Answers in this sub range from an organic distribution of individual traders to a huge short-seller that has failed to successfully suppress the price of Bitcoin that is about to get destroyed. Unfortunately the truth is far more boring.

The long-end of these derivatives products right now appears to be nearly entirely comprised of retail and institutional traders that want leveraged net-long exposure to cryptocurrency assets. The short-end of these contracts however is increasingly being owned by arbitrage agents that are net-neutral and are arbitraging the premium over spot markets that people are willing to pay for leveraged exposure. Let me describe how this strategy works:

To see how this works, suppose that the spot price of Bitcoin is $10,000 however the price of a Bitcoin future contract that expires on September 25th 2020 is $10,100, or roughly 1% higher. In an arbitrage strategy known as ""[cash-and-carr](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashandcarry.asp)y"", an actor can sell the future contract and simultaneously buy spot Bitcoin. Their net-exposure to the price of Bitcoin is zero however they have pocketed the difference between the spot and futures price  as long as they are willing to wait for the future contract to settle. This person is going to look like a short-seller because they own the short end of a futures contract, but they are in fact neutral. Agents that engage in this trade are constrained because they have a limited amount of capital, they don't want to use all of their money arbitraging a small premium if they suspect that a larger premium may present its self later. For this reason, the number of contracts / Bitcoin that they are willing to arbitrage increases as a function of the size of the premium. For example, for every $1 premium that opens on the settled futures contract, I might be willing to sell $1 million in futures contracts and buy $1 million in Bitcoin. As the premium increases, so does the size of my short futures and spot Bitcoin position.

if we look at the premium or ""basis"" on the OKex quarterly futures Bitcoin contract ([image](https://imgur.com/XWKu9YO)), we can see that the premium has gone from around $90 to $370. This premium can also be understood as an implied borrowing rate or the daily interest that buyers are willing to pay for leveraged long exposure to Bitcoin. The implied borrowing rate of [BTC](https://imgur.com/5Z1kXst) and [ETH](https://imgur.com/hYmr2qI) over the last few weeks has gone parabolic, jumping from the stable long term rate of around 0.025% per day to nearly 0.07% per day or almost 30% APR. If these plots look familiar its because they are, this same trend was spotted in [February 2020](https://imgur.com/YPeH6OU) when the implied borrowing rate of BTC and ETH briefly touched 0.1% per day before the derivatives ecosystem collapsed.

This cash-and-carry strategy also works with perpetual futures contracts since the funding rate captures the implied borrowing rate on settled futures. The strategy is the same, just short the perpetual future while buying spot and enjoy the price arbitrage as well as the funding payments on the perpetual futures position which holding no Bitcoin exposure. If premium that traders are willing to pay decreases, and therefore the futures basis shrink and the funding rate decreases, then the position is un-wound by selling spot Bitcoin and buying the futures contracts.

There are two ways that we can check to see if this strategy is being employed. The first thing that we would expect to observe is that the leverage being used by short-sellers is relatively constant as the price changes since they actually maintain a neutral position. OKex fortunately allows us to see just this ([image](https://imgur.com/Jt5yeK5)). In the last day or so, the price of Bitcoin has increased considerably, 5-6% but the leverage being used by the owners of short contracts is relatively constant. Typically what has been observed in the past week is that as the price decreases, the leverage of longs increases considerably but the leverage of shorts is invariant to price movement in either direction.

The second that we can check is to see if the open interest (OI) of these products is roughly correlated with the basis or premium on them. As the premium increases, the reward for this arbitrage also increases, and the more capital that will be deployed in that trade, thereby increasing open interest.  This does appear to be the case for [BTC](https://imgur.com/nxCz64p) and [ETH](https://imgur.com/qwS1gwm). These plots would be more informative if they included the basis instead of the absolute price, but as I showed earlier, the basis has expanded in these products nearly 1:1 as the price has increased.

Another symptom of this taking place is that the arbitrage between futures and spot is poor. I saw that someone else recently mentioned it in this thread, but large gaps are opening up where the futures get way ahead of the spot markets when they are pushing up because MMs are reluctant to arbitrage the difference. This is very likely due to their capital supplies being limited due to an already significant cash-and-carry position that they have established.

\-----------------------------

So what does this all mean? What it means is that we are in a situation where the demand for leveraged long exposure to cryptocurrency assets far exceeds the spot demand. Currently traders are willing to pay somewhere in the neighborhood of 30% APR for this exposure due to the rapidly increasing prices. Additionally, a significant amount of the ""shorts"" on these leveraged products are in some sense, fully priced into the market because they are actually part of an arbitrage strategy between the spot and derivatives markets. This is not to say that they cannot be ""squeezed"" or ""liquidated"", just that, upon their derivatives positions being liquidated they become net-long the underlying asset and have a choice to either continue to be net long or sell their spot holdings to once again become neutral while making a handsome profit.

There other implication is that we are in a situation where its very likely that most actors in an otherwise symmetric long/short derivatives instrument are actually net-long or neutral due to their spot positions. A second kind of actor that I didn't mention is those who use futures as a means of hedging their Bitcoin. For example, suppose that you own 5 BTC and think the price is high and wish to sell, however you don't want to sell them on a KYC exchange and incur a taxable event. What you can do instead is send 1 BTC to a non-KYC exchange such as BitMEX or Bybit and use it to go 5x short, giving you effectively USD exposure while also being paid funding.

Historically, the only time the ecosystem has looked like this was February-March of 2020 when the premiums on these products slightly exceeded what they are now. This of course ended with a collapse of the derivatives market when the price did finally decline into the significant long-side leverage that had accumulated. This is understandable because almost all of the money in the ecosystem is either net-long or part of a net-neutral arbitrage or hedging strategy.",g00mctu,2020-08-02 04:57:41,17

Merlin560,"PNF Update

[Here is the Chart:  11:37 AM EST](https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/pnf.php?c=%24BTCUSD,PWTADANRNO[PA][D][F1!3!!!2!20])

We were in a pretty long, long pole.  I suggested the other day we could get as high at the 12,500 range, and then drop back under 11 on the pull back.  While not to the dollar, it was pretty close.

The pole from the first breakout last week was 48 boxes, peaking at the 12,100 box.  The reversal from that point should have been about 24 boxes, or $1,200--taking it down to $10,900.  I never in 100 years figured it would happen in 15 minutes on a Saturday night.

This is bitcoin and that is how it works.

Where do we go from here?  Based on the past formations we tend to pump, dump and dither for a few days.  I think we will bounce around these areas for a while unless we see some things:  If the stock market pukes a lot, we will drop back into the $9,000s.  If gold continues to rage, we should move up with it.  If the world starts closing down again because of the virus or big riots break out in the US...we could see some instability.  I know China is playing around with allowing its people to buy gold--that could have an impact.  China ALWAYS has an impact.

We are in an interesting place.  Since the price moved upwards earlier in the day, the chart ADDED Xs to the column.  We will not see any reversal until tonight when the new day arrives at 12:00 UTC (20:00 EST).  If the price doesn't rip up higher we will not even start the formation of another pattern.  The pop up will just be a long pole in the middle of the existing pattern, and that patter will be wider.  What would have been a brief four column pattern would now need to be at least seven columns to move upward.  That is definitely a more stable pattern for growth.  The next break out would take us closer to $14k.

Don't get too bummed out about the drop.  We are literally where we were two or three days ago.

Railionn,"End of SEPTEMBER is the scheduled testnet of Mimblewimble on Litecoin. The greatest thing to ever happen to Litecoin

Mimblewimble changes the traditional model of blockchain transactions. It allows for a blockchain to have a more compact history, which is easier and faster to download, synchronize, and verify.

In a MW blockchain, there are no identifiable or reusable addresses, meaning that all transactions look like random data to an outsider. The transaction data is only visible to their respective participants.

So, a Mimblewimble block looks like one large transaction rather than a combination of many. This means that blocks can be verified and confirmed, but they give no details about each transaction. There is no way to link individual inputs with their respective outputs. This is a real problem currently, for instance, if you are a business that wants to do payroll in Bitcoin/Litecoin etc, your employees could deduce who was being paid how much through some clever analysis of the public blockchain.

Hate for Litecoin has grown over the years, but you cannot deny that this is what crypto needs to be successful. Monero will be sweating, Zcash will be sweating. Bitcoin will be sweating. Make no mistake, the implementation of mimblewimble into LTC will be a very big deal.

MobTwo,"I am a little upset with how Bitcoin ABC had handled things to be honest. I wanted Bitcoin ABC to succeed and I want to see Amaury make good money from his work. And I believe many others shared my feelings as well (or at least used to) but Bitcoin ABC keeps shooting their own foot for no good reason.

Marc De Mesel used to donate money to Bitcoin ABC, as had I, as had many other Bitcoin Cash supporters... but now these people are really unhappy with Bitcoin ABC. Of course if you piss off people who donated money to you, who supported you in the past, then they are not going to donate money to you anymore. Is it difficult to understand why Bitcoin ABC has a funding problem?

Another fact is when Roger/Bitcoin.com spent huge sums of money defending Bitcoin ABC against lawsuits from BSV, instead of being appreciative, Bitcoin ABC was still unimpressed that Roger/Bitcoin.com wasn't doing more. I thought that was being handled badly as well.

Or when I reached out to Bitcoin ABC to ask them not to proceed with IFP just yet (give Flipstarter a chance) because there is a team of people who dedicated weeks of their lives and built Flipstarter with the main purpose of helping Bitcoin ABC get funded (because Amaury keeps complaining about their funding problem). When people did something just to help you and you come up with something else to undermine their efforts, you're essentially giving these people the middle finger. In case you're wondering why all the Flipstarter campaigns got fully funded except Bitcoin ABC, maybe this is one of the main reasons.

There are 2 ways you can deal with a problem when it happened. Acknowledge the problem and deal with it so there is no problem left. Or continue to blame others, blame the whole world, ignore the facts of reality (eg. Bitcoin ABC conflicts with big BCH investors like Roger, Justin Bons, Marc De Mesel) and give all sorts of excuses instead of solving the actual problem.

Think for yourself which is the better way to solve a problem. In my opinion, Bitcoin ABC supporters should stop giving excuses and condoning behaviors that is not helpful to Bitcoin ABC.",g04uwpo,2020-08-03 04:38:44,7

readcash,"&gt; However, on a system such as Bitcoin Cash, there are already many existing users. Bitcoin Cash has a script system that has time based features, such as locking coins for a certain amount of time before they are spendable.

&gt; These features are essential for many smart contract systems, notably payment channels or recurring payment solutions such as Mecenas. These contracts do not have a source of time, and therefore use the blockchain itself as a clock. **Changing the block time would therefore effectively change the speed at which time passes for all these contracts, breaking the system they are built upon.**

&gt; To add to the challenge, Bitcoin Cash supports P2SH, which means we are not aware of all the scripts that are associated with existing coins. It is **not possible** to parse the blockchain and devise a system that would work for existing contracts, so we are forced to devise a system that will work for all contracts that could have been written. It is not certain that this can be achieved at all without **serious downsides,** but what is certain is that **nobody has the time or resources required to make an honest attempt.**

&gt; **Without a solution to this problem, we do not have a very concrete proposal to change the block time we can discuss.**

For example, if $1USD in 2022 is worth 50¢ in 2020USD, then will Bitcoin hit 200K and ETH hit $20K instead of the frequently memed 100K and 10K? Or will we just hit these psychological targets at the peak of the run despite the fact that they are only equivalent to $50K and $5K in 2020 dollars?

1. What do you think about the short and mid-term impact of the COVID economy on the XRP price? (I'm considering 1-2 years as midterm FYI)

This depends on a lot of unknowns right now.

Chiefly the Feds continued reaction to growing debt defaults in the commercial lending, and consumer lending sectors w/Un-Employment running out and 40% of small businesses bankrupt. 

If the perfect storm occurs and the Fed injects more than $500B we are in a strange place. M3 Money Supply would out strip demand, circulation, and GDP levels if no large entities buy up our debt - which no one will because everyones in the same situation.

Let’s say that happens - complete currency collapse of the USD with the 66 Countries pegged to it - rest of world follows. It would be the Weimar Republic scenario but on a global scale. 

What could that lead to - a globally accepted reset on payment methods - and or currency. 

Without tinfoil hatting it - Crypto may have a space if all those dominoes fell in terms of replacing Fiat entirely.


2. Is it still (considering all the risks associated with the crypto market as a whole) smart to buy XRP dips and hodl? How long do you foresee until a significant potential break-out?

XRP will experience dips, however its long-term value is a lock once banks have to start using their currency for asset transfers. Ignore the dips, and be patient its rise will be steady and less dramatic then Bitcoin, but it will break out once their tools go full active for asset transfers. 


3. What is your strategy with Crypto hodling during COVID?

I’m holding Fetch.AI, and XRP leaving the money in there and forgetting about it until I hit my targets an can retrieve my initial investment and ride the profits to the moon eliminating any risk.

4. Any other advice/suggestions? 

Patience in the new age crypto world will serve you well, and bring success. Focusing on short term shifts will just bring stress watch the long-term trend and how it is positioned to be scaled to exceed supply and bring value - if it has that there is a chance to reap rewards in 5 years. The guys who bought in early to Bitcoin and sold at $1,000 are hitting themselves 4 years later - the difference between a thousandare and a millionaire is patience and technical analysis for long-term forecasting.",g0ekhpa,2020-08-05 11:41:24,9

yeahdave4,"390/who cares

Long winded, pointless, and self centered post, but too bad because I am going to share it anyway. 
 I am entitled to a selfish shitpost once in a while too.

It doesn't take much to allow tunnel vision to creep in and to unknowingly become stuck in the moment.  It's easy to just ""move on"" and take things for granted.  I think it helps to take a step back every now and then and re-live how we got here.  I've been doing that today and I am going to share just pieces of the last few months lest we'd be tempted to forget.

One of the reasons why I log and share my thoughts is that it helps create a timeline and a narrative which I can revisit later.  Yes some of it is cringe worthy now but I think it is still a fun exercise to look back.

----------

&gt;Still very long since $153. I think the mid term risk to reward is much better on ETH than BTC... I firmly believe that very little is ""priced in"" for ETH. What is coming has been something we have been waiting for for many years. During the last run, the crypto space was almost entirely dominated by Bitcoin. Now more then ever Ethereum defines the very identity of crypto.

.

&gt;I'd be sweating bullets shorting here at 170.

.

&gt; ETH has a lot of value that is under appreciated at $185. Buying here is not wrong or reckless/FOMO

.

&gt;Very notable shift in strength for ETH. I wonder if people are still just too afraid to believe in this move.

That was ~4 months ago.  People were still numb.  Eth had no business being $90 again.  Many were still very skeptical of the gradual climb from the low 100's. But in just two months Eth had doubled from the low 100's to the low 200's. 

But as usual, it wasn't going to be that easy.  For one month we tossed and turned fighting to keep 200.  Sentiment went negative again very quickly.  With each test of 200, many wondered if they should take some of the recovery and run while others were smugly claiming how they sold everything in the low 200's and were going to buy back in at the low 100's.  May was not an easy month.


&gt;Going out on a limb here but I think this ETH move hasn't really started (as weird as that sounds going from 170-215).

.

&gt;Went full position long on this dump at 202.

.

&gt;We were at $140 a month ago. We'll be ok.

.

&gt;Not giving up. The bears are wrong. Added to position at 194. All in. Come get me.

🙄 Ok maybe I was a little too passionate hah

&gt;Held strong against the onslaught and now nauseatingly long at $194 with a stiff drink in hand.

&gt;If you are waking up and feeling down after seeing the price at 204 then you are missing what just happened. The retest of 200 was going to happen and given the current global environment and the stock market dump; everyone was jumping ship. The floor was about to fall out. We came so close to losing this up trend and going back into the bear market grind.

&gt;But it held. It held despite significant downward pressure. Anticipating a move towards $300 soon once Bitcoin gets back over there 1hr 100MA.

Ya that $300 comment got a lot of laughs and some nasty DMs.

&gt;Everyone is expecting this all to breakdown and fall apart. Every other comment is ""see you at 150"" or ""I am going to sell now and buy back in later"".

&gt;Y'all are in my way.

&gt;That is not what I am seeing.  As for me, I will be patient. If I am wrong, so be it. But this is why I take profits and wait for the right entry. People were looking back at my $153 and below longs and were saying how ""lucky"" I was. It was really choppy then too. It is choppy now. Just as before at 170, I'd be sweating bullets shorting here at 204.

.

&gt;I caution against the heavy negative and dour bias. You are shorting a coiled spring. This market has been beaten to death for several years. The black swan global pandemic drop to the 3000's/90's was a pivot point.

.

&gt;I can keep my thinking to myself going forward. I am going to continue ignoring the PMs. For those vacillating and inundated with the recent influx of negative opinions; here is a contrary voice to add to the discussion. That is all.

Before you think I was just sloberingly bullish the whole time, I wasn't.  It doesn't take much to have months of margin gains suddenly wiped out in 5 minutes.  I also mentioned warnings/hedge shorts just before the inevitable stop hunt dumps that mysteriously immediately recovered.  I'll skip over those.

Finally at the end of May we broke out of the 210's and the switch flipped to extreme excitement.  This of course came at a bad time.  There were several days of euphoria as we neared 250 and many piled in only to get burned over and over again.  Yet again we were in for suffering.   June and July was going to wear us out with the numerous bounces from 220's to 240's.

Early June:
&gt;Going forward I am going to trade less (for now).
Where do we go from here?

&gt;My basic answer is that it is VERY unclear and directionless right now. 
&gt;Margin positions are very very high risk right now. The risk is much higher than the reward.

But I mentioned 
&gt;I have a 20x from $76 that I am keeping open until ~$360-400. 
I think we will be back at 250 soon.

Of course then the whining and the complaining started as Vechain and Cardano and Nano and whatever else started to make large moves while Eth sat there.  With Eth seemingly stuck below 250, frustration and fatigue was almost worse than at $90.

&gt;The same thing that happened just before the last run to $1400 is about to start. It is an essential and critical indicator: The complaining.

&gt;Either:

&gt;Eth sucks and ""those lazy devs keep delaying making me rich"" and ""waa where my moon""

&gt;or

&gt;Eth hasn't even *remotely* begun to move.

&gt;Choose now and plan accordingly because I promise you this lag will happen again (is already happening). Choose which project has more potential, provides more value to the human race, and is more likely to exist years from now.

I think we lost a lot of people those two months.  But then finally on July 19 ([yellow arrow](https://imgur.com/Uf4NMk4)):

&gt;recently the risk to reward for ETH has shifted favorably into a break to the upside.

&gt;How I am positioned:

&gt;My entire ETH trading stack is now deployed from $232-238 (rare for me)

The rest will soon be history but for years this community suffered and patiently waited.  Years and years holding, supporting, and building a nascent and volatile asset.

jessquit,"&gt;My opinion about Amaury is that he is not a bad person 

..


&gt; Amaury has a serious problem of collaborating with people

In the end, what's the difference?

A ""good person"" is one who values others.

I don't think Amaury values others. Not sufficiently. Not even close. 

When you Google ""what is a good person"" these are the top two results:

They're just pop-sci, so take them with a grain of salt. But, I suspect you'll find them largely agreeable. And they are not flattering to Amaury.

https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/cutting-edge-leadership/201610/how-can-you-tell-if-you-are-good-person

I've managed many more software teams than Amaury has. I'll tell you right now, I would have fired Amaury years ago. In my opinion, while he's clearly a smart guy, he's toxic to team building.

Now we are witnessing a face off between Amaury, and the rest of the community, which has rallied around Jonathan Toomim. At least in terms of proven character traits, Amaury isn't even in the same league as Jonathan. And the community knows it. Jonathan is, like Amaury, extremely intelligent, but he possesses a character trait that I have never observed in Amaury: humility. Which I consider to be a very high virtue. Jonathan is open minded, sincere, listens to others, gives credit where due, and is sufficiently humble that he doesn't want to be in charge. Which is exactly why he should be. 

BCH - Bitcoin - stands at a precipice. Very soon we're going to have the next test. Is ""consensus money"" doomed to be dominated by the most toxic people in the room? Or will it successfully route around toxic people?

The second test - the Faketoshi test - was a qualified success.

I'm back to just looking at charts for what they are, feels good to be back with the bulls. I was all setup for altseason and BTC running and what I ""thought"" should happen fucked me up instead of just looking at charts.  

To me it's been all about the dollar and I totally missed [this downtrend channel](https://www.tradingview.com/x/puixs1H6/). If we don't get some crazy market blowup it should trend down, which means Bitcoin goes on a massive run. I'm still cautious because there is a [giant IHS](https://www.tradingview.com/x/xfAmXcoG/) but I think more big stimulus will be pushed through. 

Altcoins broke through the downtrend since 2018 and have amazing setups, we are [at resistance](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ayk2CB8V/) and might get a small pullback but I'll be buying some. 

DXY might get some bullish action soon which would give BTC a small retrace, there is an open BTC gap at 9k something which would be an amazing buy but we might not get there.

ftrader,"BCHN supports and works toward the goals of the common Bitcoin Cash vision that you linked at bitcoincash.org. 

I've stated that commitment in the past.

Additionally, we have [some broader objectives we have set for our project](https://bitcoincashnode.org/en/goals) and when it comes to the work we are doing, we follow a [project plan](https://schedule.bitcoincashnode.org/BCHN-task-detail.html).

As for a ""BCHN roadmap"", by which I would understand a technology roadmap for our project, that is something which we still need to develop. It will take more time, effort and consultation with our user base and the rest of the ecosystem.

The primary needs we are working on as per our initial crowdfunding, are:

- DAA replacement
- improving test networks
- raising unconfirmed chain limits
- ensuring that smart contract script have necessary mathematical operations

Then there are other technologies we feel will help to scale Bitcoin Cash and make it a better &amp; more useful for of money. These too will require additional sponsorship (read: crowdfunding) and devolved leadership (finding people to champion their development). We've mentioned many or all of these in our Flipstarter proposal:

- Fast, secure and more compatible API connections (this includes using better network transport protocols)
- Double Spend Proofs and Notifications
- UTXO/UtreeXO commitments
- Better block propagation with compatible Xthinner and/or Graphene
- Better multi-processing (enabling use of all processing cores during block validation)
- Adaptive blocksize limit proposals (to replace fixed limit)
- Pre-consensus options (we are open to evaluating Storm and Avalanche)
- Extending capability of smart contract features
- Improving the transaction format

As an open source community-driven project, we rely heavily on not only community funding but also working with engaged developers who want to see these items realized.

We are fortunate to enjoy good collaboration with other projects and independent developers in the Bitcoin Cash space.",g0kewtg,2020-08-06 23:48:20,7

What the fuck is wrong with this guy? This guy is a delusional megalomaniac psychopath — and he is FIRED. 

There are approximately 937.5 Bitcoin Cash coins mined each day. At the current market rate of $316 USD per coin, that is approximately $296,250 USD worth of coins mined per day. 

8% of that is $23,700 USD. Per day. 

$23,700 per day. That's what Amaury believes his income should be, and what he believes his value is worth. $23,700 per day. That's $711,000 per month. Or $8.5 million per year. 

Sounds perfectly reasonable. 😅😂🤣 

Oh, and that's at today's extremely low prices, too.

Everyone under $100k is lucky to buy bitcoin that cheap. Buy and hold for several years, you will always profit. 

Bitcoin is young for a currency, only 12 years, but look how big it already is!

12 years is a long time for tech to be proven. Bitcoin has never been stronger, more secure, or bigger, in hashrate, new wallets and second layer solutions. If bitcoin would have died, it already would have. It's only getting bigger and stronger.

Look what the FED and other central banks are doing, printing trillions. Bitcoin gets more recognition everyday, it is fighting for its spot next to silver and gold. And winning, too. If it grows as much as the market cap of gold, around 9 trillion or so, it's said 1 btc would be around $350k - $500k. Give it time and it will outgrow gold in market cap, that's what I think, there is lot of room to grow.

Go all in, I would do the same! 

Look up these people to educate yourself. Start with Andreas Antonopolous, great beginners serie on YouTube, and google these great people: Gigi, Robert Breedlove, Dan Held, PlanB, Knut Svanholm and I am sure you'll get a great amount of fascinating links, bitcoin is never boring!

And some more bitcoin resources: [https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information.html](https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information.html)

Bitcoin has great 4 years cycles, with high peaks, and badass drops. But every for years there is new all time high, higher than before. We're at the start of a massive bull run. Planb's stock2flow model's target is around $288k this cycle, we'll see. It's going to be one hell of a ride. Make sure your hands are strong. The cycle next to this one will bring us close to (half?) a million dollar bitcoin, and we'll still be only just starting..

nick_badlands,"Hey all,  


Have posted some updates over the years in the daily's about my mission to convert the large UK finance company I work for to using blockchain.  Given presentations all the way up to the exec team over the years and was given the job of keeping my company up to date.  Still in regular contact with the exec responsible for our capital markets side since, he's a convert and sends me emails with blockchain news :)  


Starting on a presentation to give an update to people, been a couple of years since I did one to a wider audience so can r/ethfinance help me out?  


Topics I have so far:  


* Market Conditions – End of the bear market?
* Institutional Adoption – Bitcoin CMEs, Banks, Rating Agencies, Exchanges, Institutional FOMO?
* Derivatives – Huge rise in demand since 2017
* DeFi – Decentralised Finance and the rise of decentralised derivatives
* Ethereum Scaling – Child chains, Side chains and ZKrollups
* Ethereum 2.0 – Move to PoS / More scaling!
* Oracles – Enabling smart contracts to evolve, importance of reliability in DeFi

Any other big ones I've missed?",g0q3of9,2020-08-08 06:28:22,8

readcash,"I think there's one thing you don't consider. People just don't trust ABC based on their history to spend this money well. ABC did not try to explain **why** they need exactly that amount, what is the process on how they are going to decide what to use it on, etc... 

You skip this part as if it's not important and we can work it out later AFTER we all agree to IFP. 

But why should we? 

I say we must know this BEFORE we agree to it. 

We already have a system that takes our money and distributes it ""wisely"" (called ""taxation""), but even then the government publishes the detailed budget for the next year, quarter, etc... And it still sucks, you just know that this money is nowhere close to 100% effectiveness, that you money is going to fund a war or prisons or something you didn't agree to.

Now **imagine** a different situation - one where ABC comes out in January and tells people: 

&gt; Hey everybody, we have a proposal to collect some funds and use them to develop Bitcoin Cash further. This is a very preliminary idea, so we're totally open to feedback, let's discuss it.

&gt; We want to collect $5.5M over the next 6 months and we plan to use it for the following:

&gt; 1) Hire 2 scientists ($250,000/year each max) for one year to help us research possibility to deploy Avalanche

&gt; 2) Hire 2 additional C++ developers ($200,000/year each max) to help us backporting stuff from Bitcoin Core - they are releasing a ton of stuff and we need to merge it, this blocks our important work

&gt; 3) Lead developers salary: Amaury ($200,000/year), Anthony ($200,000/year) - discussable, but that's about what they could get on open market

&gt; 4) Buy better hardware (4 iMacs, 2 MacBooks) for lead developers - about $20,000, this will speed up the development

&gt; 5) Hire a PR guy to improve our communications with public, because Amaury is better used in other place ($75,000)

....

&gt; 33) We want to have additional $100,000 buffer just in case we missed something somewhere in our calculations (that's about 2% of total amount)

&gt; Any money left over (if we manager to hire people cheaper or some plans are cancelled as not possible) will be kept and we'll open a discussion on how to better use it.

&gt; This is a total of $5.5M. We have contacted some miners and they are willing to donate $500K, we have contacted Roger Ver and Marc de Mesel, they are ready to donate $1M more, but we're still $3M short for our plan.

&gt; One of the ideas that we have thought about, was to make a hard fork where 3.5% of miners coinbase will go to ABC for 6 months, that would be exactly $3M we're missing. This will drop our hashrate 3.5% for 6 months, but will allow us to build this incredible thing. We understand that it's a serious issue and we want to hear some ideas on how should we proceed.

Then in March a community builds a Flipstarter and ABC collects maybe $300K more. After that they go to the community and talk about how all current options are exhausted and we need to seriously think about IFP.

I can guarantee that the reaction to THIS approach would have been totally different than to ""12.5% to HK corp. everything is already decided, the deal is done, k thx bye!""",g0ta5cp,2020-08-09 03:41:29,3

jtoomim,"&gt; Does it bother you that me simply asking that question already gave me 4 downvotes?

Not really. I think it was a question that you should have not asked publicly. You were asking me for a promise to put in effort for (currently) zero pay. That is putting me on the spot, and puts me in the difficult position of having to either answer truthfully (as i did -- I explained what I'm certain that I'm interested in doing for free ) or dishonestly (to promise the world in order to achieve political gain). It was not a good question to ask of someone in such a politicized and uncertain context.

&gt; We're about to kick ABC out and have no long term committed devs,

I've been a Bitcoin dev since 2015. Freetrader has been around since at least 2016 (I don't know his/her full history). Tom Harding and Zander, Dagurval, and others have been around far longer than that. What's worth more: a promise, or a track record?

Other native coins haven't suffered the amount of forks that bitcoin did.  u/My1xT is correct in saying that the apps for different coins are coded to use different signature formats.  The U2F app for example, can't sign a bitcoin transaction because it doesn't have the code to be able to do so.  The apps which run on the device are open source, so anyone can audit the code.  When apps are running, they can't see the seed and that's enforced by the firmware.

epic_trader,"Everyone is talking about PoS being so great because you can stake and it cuts electricity consumption, but the real boon is finality and the cost associated with attacking the chain. You got it right except an attacker in PoS can't rewrite history as epochs can't be changed and they'll just get their funds slashed/deleted. I believe an attacker needs to control 1/3 of all staked ETH to successfully attack the network, so that's probably an expense of $400,000,000-4,000,000,000 to attack the network which is like 100s of times more expensive than attacking Bitcoin for an hour",g0xuf0q,2020-08-10 08:14:26,3

decibels42,"The reasoning behind Bitcoin’s SOV argument is that it is circular.

ETH is a better SOV with eth2 because it’s issuance will be less than Bitcoin’s for about 10 years at 0.5%, and fee burning under EIP 1559 can make that issuance rate go lower, potentially negative.

The *real* important thing beyond that, imo, is that people will want ETH for reasons other than simple belief that it’s a SOV. At minimum it is the security mechanism of the network that is an income generating asset through staking. Then factor in DeFi and other income generating uses and *now* you have a real SOV that mirrors gold and commodities a bit more realistically.

That said, this isn’t a zero sum game. Bitcoin is cool. I have no problems with it.

Yes that includes right before the 2008 crash. The market *as a whole* always comes back, if you're invested long term crashes don't matter. You're not going to time the market. What if it doesn't crash? Then you've lost out on returns. What if it goes up another 10% and corrects by 8%? You'd still have lost money by not being invested.

Actually looking at the date, it's possible that the version of Bitcoin at the time didn't even have the next 100 keys generated -- the first handful of versions required you to back up your `wallet.dat` **after each transaction**.

When I first started following bitcoin back then I was shocked at how error-prone the design was, and am still surprised it took so many years to get deterministic wallet seeds.

almkglor,"They make it harder for online hackers to get at your private keys.

Private keys are what control your Bitcoin holdings.  If you do not hold your keys, you do not hold your coins.  All web wallets do *not* let *you* hold the keys, the website operator holds the keys, thus are ""custodial"" and if *they* are hacked, or ""hacked"" (i.e. inside job from a disgruntled employee, or even the golden parachute of the founders of the website), you could lose all your coins.

The proper thing to do is to hold your own keys on your own hardware that you control yourself.

You can do this with an ordinary laptop or desktop or phone (e.g. just download Electrum); this is hardware you control yourself, after all, you can run with a laptop or phone or move house with your desktop, so all the data stored therein is yours in much the same way the hardware is yours.  The problem is that general-purpose computers like laptops and desktops and phones are easy to hack especially if it does not run GNU/Linux, and especially since they are usually 100% online when they are turned on.

A hardware wallet is a dedicated very low-power computer, which specifically does not connect online.  The things they can do are very limited: they can only sign transactions, and only if you physically press a button on the hardware wallet to authorize it.  Because of the limited scope of what they can do, they are very much harder to hack online.

Note that hardware wallets are still vulnerable if somebody is able to acquire physical access to them (specialized hackers can use standard electronics lab equipment to extract private keys from it).  But then: possession is 9/10 of the law, and that applies here as well, so keeping the wallet physically secure is still necessary.  The important thing is that hardware wallets greatly reduce the scope of remote online attacks.",g16bap7,2020-08-12 11:49:24,8

Doc-Engineer,"They can't just ""run a script"" though, that's not really how it works. The few times law enforcement has managed to track Bitcoin transactions across addresses was because they were able to follow the BTC amount rather than the addresses, because they were unique, large-sized transactions. If tumbling services are compromised by hackers that's not a great sign, but it sounds like Tor has been buckling down to fix that as of May when they were alerted. Either way, the only time any link to me actually comes up it's encrypted with the buyers public key, so unless they perform a sting that I actually decide to buy from (unlikely because I use the same few trusted vendors who have been around forever on multiple markets), they would be hard pressed to collect my identity for any reasonable cost to them. Tails alone is hard as shit to trace and destroys all the evidence as soon as the flash disk is pulled, with the exception of the encrypted private message with my address sent to the trusted vendor, and the anonymous BTC transactions.

It also helps to use public WiFi that doesn't block .onion routing along with that MAC spoof. Then even if they do trace the network responsible for the BTC transactions they won't know who it was, unless I got caught on video like a dumb shit. But again, by the time they're watching local business security footage the cost of man hours alone would be through the roof.",g16nrjn,2020-08-12 13:59:46,7

&gt;Those messages revealed that in May 2016, Musbach arranged through the website for the child to be killed, prosecutors said. After asking if the girl was too young to target and being told the age wasn't a problem, prosecutors said Musbach paid approximately $20,000 in bitcoin for the hit.   
&gt;  
&gt;When pressed for an additional $5,000 to secure the hit, Musbach eventually sought to cancel and asked for a refund of his $20,000. The website’s administrator then revealed that the site was a scam and threatened to reveal Musbach’s information to law enforcement.

Tricky_Troll,"I'm just going to post this comment reply I made further down for visibility because I think it's an interesting discussion. Let me know what you all think. But here is my ideal top 10 coins by market cap in 2023:

**My dream list of 2023:**

1. ETH

2. Bitcoin

3. DAI - the native permissionless stablecoin for DeFi

4. USDC - Probably the most trustworthy bet if I had to hold $1 million in any stable coin for the next 10 years. I love DAI but over a long time scale, a project build on smart contracts which have only been deployed for a few years is high risk.

5. LINK - I think it might deserve to be a little bit further down the list at the moment until their oracles become truly decentralised.

6. MKR - Someone needs to govern all that DAI!

7. - 10. Mixture of Dexes (COMP, KNC, AAVE etc), interoperability and infrastructure tokens like RLC or REN (If BTC is no. 2 then this could be huge). I could also see Polkadot being in here. Not because I think it will come close to killing ETH but rather because they are focusing on interoperability which is exactly how to survive in an ETH dominated world. If you can't beat 'em join 'em. I can definitely see polkadot carving its own little niche in the comig years and its interoperability with ETH will put it ahead of Charles Hoscoinson chain and ""The Ethereum of [insert asian nation here]"" chains.

**Note:** I didn't include Monero because I would hope that more substantial privacy tech has been implemented by 2022 on Ethereum. Also, I can't see privacy coins keeping up with other coins in the long run because their target market is only so big.

**Note 2:** This is a pipe dream. The top 10 will never look like this since  ETH and BTC competitors/forks will always be overpriced due to speculation on them overtaking ETH/BTC 

**Note 3:** Yes I put Bitcoin at number 2. 21 million hard cap is super memeable and very compelling as we enter a world of [brrr](https://brrr.money/) and another selling point is that it would be superior to gold in a not too distant future where asteroid gold threatens the dominance of gold as a store of value asset. If you don't like Bitcoin being at number 2, fight me.

Sooner or later, the government's got to start paying for them-- some of these stimulus for some of the deficits, for some of the well-deserved, very smart subsidies that it's providing to people.""

And then the notion isn't to hide or to seek a tax refuge but to have something that can't be undermined by the government, and it won't become worthless if the currency becomes worthless or at least if enough Robinhooders happen to believe that.

There's no yields today. And so Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency becomes a very attractive either long term, I want to make a safe haven for my money or a short-term speculative bet.

Ethereum is at a point in 2021-2022 that it can succeed without Bitcoin and the sooner people realize that the better. If you don't believe me just watch what happens with the Three Gorges Dam in China if that Levee Breaks.

10,000+ ETH: whale. In at ICO and somehow didn’t manage to sell. Vitalik, Lublin, etc. some of the project owners and developers. OG folks in here, etc. Hundred millionaires at ETH 10k. 

1,000+ ETH: Probably a decent chunk of active people here. Some of the ones who have retired on crypto. Invested $10,000 in an experimental magic internet money in 2016 that had no proof points and was likely going to fail. An insane thing to do at the time.

100+ ETH: Good job. You’ve been able to accumulate multiple nodes. These could each be worth **a million dollars some day** according to some here. Hopefully enough income to be financially independent. Crypto millionaires at ETH 10k. I hope to see some golden showers.

Furthermore, the ownership base of Bitcoin is a vanishingly small percentage of the total addressable market. The anticipation of new entrants into the market and thus increased future demand further reinforces this expectation of Bitcoin's increased purchasing power. 

However, as Bitcoin is more widely adopted, this ownership base will continue to grow up until a point where there are very few new entrants into the market. The absence of new demand will cause a plateau in Bitcoin's price level, the degree to which holders anticipate an increase in their purchasing power will diminish, and their propensity to save will be marginally shifted toward consumption. This process will usher in the next phase of Bitcoin's monetisation. This transition will make Bitcoin much more suitable as a 'Medium of Exchange' and is representative of the aggregate shift toward 'use Bitcoin'.",g1n7xnt,2020-08-16 05:04:19,18

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/search?q=microstrategy&amp;restrict\_sr=1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/search?q=microstrategy&amp;restrict_sr=1) 

Thats the company that butters were so happy about because they claimed to have bought some bitcoin.

And apparently, its by the far the most expensive domain sale,

&gt; So $30 million for a domain? Yep, that’s a record by a long shot, topped only by Sex.com for $13 million. It was actually more than $30 million because the buyer, block.one, paid a commission to GoDaddy. 

And whats weird is that honestly I felt that we are well past the whole dot com high valuation phase. 

Here,

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_most\_expensive\_domain\_names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_domain_names) 

[Sex.com](https://Sex.com) was sold a decade ago! And [sex.com](https://sex.com) was basically making half a million or something just from ads (no porn):

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex.com) 

Just look at the domains sold recently before that. All huge sales, but barely 10% of [Voice.com](https://Voice.com).

Something else interesting about MicroStrategy:

 [https://domainnamewire.com/2019/07/30/voice-com-sale-helps-microstrategy-turn-a-profit/](https://domainnamewire.com/2019/07/30/voice-com-sale-helps-microstrategy-turn-a-profit/) 

 

&gt;MicroStrategy Incorporated (Nasdaq: MSTR) turned a profit in the second quarter of this year, but only because it [sold Voice.com for $30 million](https://domainnamewire.com/2019/06/20/yes-voice-com-is-the-most-expensive-publicly-announced-domain-ever-sold/).  
&gt;  
&gt;The company reported earnings this afternoon. It had net income of $20.4 million, or $1.98 per share on a diluted basis. After paying taxes, it netted $21.8 million on Voice.com.  
&gt;  
&gt;Take out the domain name sale and MicroStrategy had a net loss for the second quarter of $1.4 million, or $0.14 per share.

So what's going on? This company is losing money, sold one domain that turned it's quarter into a profit, and then next year, buys millions of bitcoins?",g1nd9g8,2020-08-16 05:31:08,13

&gt;*“Cryptocurrency’s promise is to make money and payments universally accessible– to anyone, no matter where they are in the world.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The Decentralized Finance (DeFi) or Open Finance movement takes that promise a step further. Imagine a global, open alternative to every financial service you use today — savings, loans, trading, insurance and more — accessible to anyone in the world with a smartphone and internet connection.”* \[Source\]  
&gt;  
&gt;DeFi has evolved substantially over the past couple of years.  
&gt;  
&gt;No longer is it limited to simple lending / borrowing with over collateralisation on Ethereum.  
&gt;  
&gt;Synthetic assets have exploded in popularity.  
&gt;  
&gt;These are tokens pegged to legacy assets such as fiat currencies, metals and commodities.  
&gt;  
&gt;Others represent native blockchain assets such as Bitcoin or other tokens.  
&gt;  
&gt;While DeFi is possible on other blockchains, Ethereum is dominating this space.  
&gt;  
&gt;There is more Bitcoin “wrapped” into the Ethereum network than Bitcoin’s own scaling solutions.  
&gt;  
&gt;These advancements have lead to a whole new world of borrowing, lending and derivatives.

nick_badlands,"Commented earlier about slides I'm doing to update my company, my ETH 2.0 info:  


&gt;Ethereum is poised to make a large move into the next phase of its roadmap.  
&gt;  
&gt;This will see it shift from using “proof-of-work” to using “proof-of-stake”  
&gt;  
&gt;This means that the network will no longer rely on the massive energy cost of “mining” that uses specialised hardware like Bitcoin.  
&gt;  
&gt;Instead it will rely on node owners who lock up Ethereum, using simple software and low cost devices.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ethereum node owners that lock up their ETH are given a reward instead of the miners for processing transactions.  
&gt;  
&gt;Using this method will mean the transaction speed will increase drastically.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;With the layer 2 solutions and Ethereum 2.0, this will deliver the speed and ability to equal and surpass current internet / cloud technologies.  
&gt;  
&gt;For example, Visa does approx. 1,700 transactions per second.  
&gt;  
&gt;Twitter is around 5,700 per second.   
&gt;  
&gt;Ethereum 2.0 without layer 2 solutions will allow 100,000 transactions per second.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ethereum 1.0 is around 15 transactions per second.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The possibilities for what could develop, given what is possible with 15 transactions a second, is hard to quantify.

Chart:  [Point and Figure Chart for $BTC](https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/pnf.php?c=%24BTCUSD,PWTADANRNO[PA][D][F1!3!!!2!20])

(Chart at 13:15 EDT, with the price at 11,844.

I know it feels like we are stuck on a hamster wheel again, but it is merely a consolidation period.

As much as the gains over the last few days are exciting, in the grand scheme of things it is merely noise.  If you take a look at the chart you will see that we are well within the recently established trading range.  That range goes from 11,150 up to 11,950.  

The formation we are in right now is 10 columns wide, which is getting a little wider than normal over the past year or so.  The attempts at 12,000 and above have been pushed back pretty harshly.  But that is to be expected as we grow into areas with much thinner air.  

I tend to think of the 15k-20k range as not really reflecting ATH pressures as we really spent a small amount of time in those ranges.  The rocket from 17k to 20k took about 48 hours if I recall.  That is not exactly a process of consolidation.  

So, I think we stay in our current range from 11,250 to 11,950  for a little more diddling around.  Keep in mind that as long as we stay in this formation, the “explosive” nature of the move up (or down) is being magnified.  The consolidation that is demonstrated by the width of the formation (how many columns across at its widest, unbroken point) should be considered a spring.  With each new column within the formation, that spring is turned one more time.  As any elementary school student knows that the tighter you wind a spring, the more tension is released when it is unleashed.  

That pattern is common for bitcoin.  We should see another move fairly soon (days, not hours or minutes.). When it happens, and the price rises above 12,000 look for the “width” of the formation count (11 wide if it goes up) would be added to the break out price—giving you a price target in the next 30 days of about $550 dollars above the breakout.  That's nothing to sneeze at.

In the mean time, we could decline to the 11,250 point of the range without losing much sleep.  If you were shorting from these areas I would start looking to close out at a price above 11,250 with most of the trade.  If it goes below 11,250 —the tension is released and the downward count would be ten boxes.  If you are shorting then, you would have a lot of rooms for a fast, and significant drop.

Point and Figure Charting does not take volume into consideration.  I tend to keep an eye on it.  Right now the volume is kind of middling (CoinbasePro).  In the recent past big jumps have come when the volume declines under 7,000 or so.  (I am eyeballing it, so go along with the estimates.)  I think we are still finding our sea legs on this.",g1r34bl,2020-08-17 02:19:54,4

BigBlockIfTrue,"# [Release Notes for Bitcoin Cash Node version 22.0.0](https://docs.bitcoincashnode.org/doc/release-notes/release-notes-22.0.0/)

Bitcoin Cash Node version 22.0.0 is now available from:

  &lt;https://bitcoincashnode.org&gt;


## Overview

This is a major release of Bitcoin Cash Node that implements the
[November 15, 2020 Network Upgrade](https://upgradespecs.bitcoincashnode.org/2020-11-15-upgrade/).
This will upgrade the difficulty targeting used in Bitcoin Cash to a
commonly agreed new algorithm called ASERT.

Additionally, this version contains many corrections and improvements.

User who are running any of our previous releases (0.21.x) are urged to
upgrade to v22.0.0 well ahead of November 2020.


## Usage recommendations

The update to Bitcoin Cash Node 22.0.0 is required for the November 15, 2020
Bitcoin Cash network upgrade.


## Semantic version numbering

As of version 22.0.0, Bitcoin Cash Node uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for its version numbers.
Hence our version numbers no longer start with a zero.

Semantic versioning makes it easy to tell from the change in version
number what are the impacts on interfaces and backward compatibility:

- A major version (first number) change indicates that an interface changed
in a way that makes the new software incompatible with older releases.

- A minor version change indicates added functionality that is backwards
compatible.

- A patch version (third number) change indicates that a new release only
contains bug fixes which are backward compatible.


## Network changes

### Changes to automatic banning

Automatic banning of peers for bad behavior has been slightly altered:

- Automatic bans are now referred to as ""discouraged"" in log output, as
  they're not (and weren't even before) strictly banned: incoming connections
  are still allowed from them (as was the case before this change), but they're
  preferred for eviction.

- Automatic bans will no longer time-out automatically after 24 hours.
  Depending on traffic from other peers, automatic bans may time-out at an
  indeterminate time.

- Automatic bans will no longer be persisted across restarts. Only manual bans
  will be persisted.

- Automatic bans will no longer be returned by the `listbanned` RPC.

- Automatic bans can no longer be lifted with the `setban remove` RPC command.
  If you need to remove an automatic ban, you must clear all automatic bans with
  the `clearbanned false true` RPC command, or restart the software to clear
  automatic bans.

- All extant automatic bans (""node misbehaving"") that are currently stored in the
  node's `banlist.dat` file will be converted into ""manual bans"" and will expire
  within 24 hours after first running this version of BCHN.


### Regtest network now requires standard transactions by default

The regression test chain, that can be enabled by the `-regtest` command line
flag, now requires transactions to not violate standard policy by default.
Making the default the same as for mainnet, makes it easier to test mainnet
behavior on regtest. Be reminded that the testnet still allows non-standard
txs by default and that the policy can be locally adjusted with the
`-acceptnonstdtxn` command line flag for both test chains.


### Graceful expiration of this version on May 15, 2021

A mechanism has been added to this version such that it will gracefully
expire on May 15, 2021, at the time of the network upgrade which is
tentatively scheduled to occur then. Once this software expires, the RPC
subsystem will disallow RPC commands. This feature can be disabled with
the `-expire=0` option. Furthermore, the date of expiration can be altered
with the `-tachyonactivationtime=&lt;n&gt;` option.

This feature has been added as a safety measure to prevent this version of
the node software from mining or otherwise transacting on an incompatible
chain, should an upgrade take place on May 15th, 2021. This version will begin
to warn via RPC ""warnings"", via a GUI message, and via periodic messages to the
log starting 30 days prior to May 15th, 2021.

Once the future consensus rules of the May 15th, 2021 upgrade to the Bitcoin
Cash network have been determined, a new version of Bitcoin Cash Node will be
made available well in advance of May 15th, 2021. It is recommended that all
users of Bitcoin Cash Node update their nodes at that time so as to ensure
uninterrupted operation.

*Related configuration options:*

- `-expire`: Specify `expire=0` in the configuration file or `-expire=0`
on the CLI to disable the aforementioned graceful expiration mechanism
(default: 1).

- `-tachyonactivationtime=&lt;n&gt;`: This option controls when the expiration
mechanism (if enabled) will expire the node and disable RPC (&lt;n&gt; seconds since
epoch, default: 1621080000).


## Deprecated functionality

### Autotools build system

The autotools build system (`autogen`, `configure`, ...) is deprecated and
will be removed in a future release. CMake is the replacement build system,
look at the documentation for the build instructions. To continue using the
autotools build system, pass the --enable-deprecated-build-system flag to
`configure`.

### CashAddr enabled by default in bitcoin-tx

The bitcoin-tx tool has fully supported CashAddr since v0.21.2. CashAddr in JSON
output was disabled by default, but relying on this default was deprecated.
Version 22.0.0 now changes the default to enabled. Specify `-usecashaddr=0` to
retain the old behavior.


## Removed functionality

### `medianfeerate` field removed from `getblockstats`

The `medianfeerate` field in `getblockstats` output has been removed. The 50th
percentile from the `feerate_percentiles` array should be used instead.

### `-datacarrier` removed

The bitcoind/bitcoin-qt option `-datacarrier` was deprecated in v0.21.2 and has
now been removed in v22.0.0. Instead, use the existing option `-datacarriersize`
to control relay and mining of OP_RETURN transactions, e.g. specify
`-datacarriersize=0` to reject them all.

### BIP9 support removed

Bitcoin Cash Node 22.0.0 removed the (incomplete) BIP9 support. In earlier
versions, it already was inactive due to no available proposals to vote on. The
empty `softforks` field in `getblockchaininfo` has been removed.

### Prototypical Avalanche removed

The Avalanche prototype features have been removed from this release
pending specification and evaluation.

### Windows 32-bit build removed

The 32-bit Windows target is no longer supported and has been removed from
the release shipment.

Users that wish to build for 32 bits Windows should be aware that
this will not be tested by the Bitcoin Cash Node team and be prepared to
resolve issues on their own.


## New RPC methods

No changes.


## Low-level RPC changes

- The `sigops` and `sigoplimit` values returned by the `getblocktemplate`
  and `getblocktemplatelight` methods are now calculated according to the
  SigChecks specification.

- The `clearbanned` method now optionally can take two additional boolean
  arguments (both default to true if unspecified). These arguments can be used
  to control whether manual or automatic bans are to be cleared (or both).

- The `listbanned` method no longer lists automatic bans.

- The `listbanned` method's results array has changed slightly. All entries
  now have their `banned_reason` as ""manually added"" (since `listbanned` can
  now only ever show manual bans). The ""node misbehaving"" value for this key
  will never appear. This key is now deprecated and may be removed altogether
  in a future release of BCHN.

- The `setban` method can no longer lift individual automatic bans. Use
  `clearbanned` instead to clear all bans, or `clearbanned false true` to
  clear all automatic bans (while preserving all manual bans).

The argument that bitcoin is more reliable works before the lights go out or you lose your wallet. In fact, by the time you have to worry about the banks or Wall Street stealing the gold/securities/rare art/diamonds/etc out of the vault society is so fucked nobody is going to be using bitcoin.

Peng_Fei,"I just finished listening to the \`Bitcoin vs Ethereum\` with Samsom Mow and Vitalik Buterin podcast by Peter McCormack, Here are my thoughts on it all.

&amp;#x200B;

Not everyone will agree with my opinions, and I'm not expecting for everyone to do so. That being said, I believe that in the short-medium term, Bitcoin will continue to dominate the crypto markets. It's well known, has a solid goal/vision of being a store of value and people trust it as hard money. What Bitcoin excels at, Ethereum falls behind in. Ethereum on the other-hand is well established as the go to Smart Contract platform to develop on, with a work in progress Monetary Policy. I believe this is the correct approach as well, as the Ethereum blockchain continues to innovate and be the place to build Smart Contracts on. What I want out of Ethereum though for it's long term goal is to finalize it's blockchain technology,  develop an acceptable scalable solution on the base layer and perform less tinkering with it's base layer over time. Afterwards, continue to cement ETH the asset as the store of value for the new digital economy. Whether it be through stablecoins backed by ETH, staking, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout the podcast, Samsom would throw slight jabs at Vitalik for things like the DAO hack back in 2016; Vitaliks statements on the internet of money shouldn't have transaction costs more than 5 cents; or how easy it is for scammers to thrive on the Ethereum blockchain. While we all agree that the rollback of the chain is something we will never agree to again, we cannot fault Ethereum as a whole due to one event. In fact, it was brought up during the podcast that Bitcoin had a similar situation of having to rollback it's chain due to an inflation bug. Bitcoiners tend to shrug this off as not being similar to the DAO situation, when in fact they are one in the same. Samson also brought up that Vitalik has this centralized control over the development of Ethereum through his statements on Twitter. This is blatantly false, while Vitalik can and should have his own opinions on the future of Ethereum, ultimately the future of Ethereum is up to the community and this community can listen to Vitalik, or shrug off his statements. Samson also brought up that there are constant hacks on Ethereum, but this statement too is false. Ethereum the blockchain has not been hacked, and Ethereum doesn't scam people. The truth is, Ethereum allows it's community to do whatever it is they please , it doesn't discriminate. In fact, all of the scams and hacks mentioned by Samson, are possible on top of Bitcoin as well, all it takes is for someone to develop an application that gains traction. I don't feel Vitalik during the podcast defended Ethereum well enough . 

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, I at the moment do not see ETH as a SoV, but I treat ETH as a SoV, and I see a future where ETH can be a SoV for the new digital economy so long as we help build and cement ETH's monetary policy which in due time, will be a reality. The Ethereum blockchain will continue to be the #1 Smart Contract platform, and with ETH 2.0 on the horizon, it will cement it's place even further. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let us work together to build this new digital economy together.",g1xdwig,2020-08-18 08:46:08,16
Tricky_Troll,"There are basically 3 phases of a bull market. These are:

1. Bitcoin pushes upwards, altcoins sit back and watch.

2. Bitcoin moves sideways, investors get impatient and look for gains elsewhere, altcoins pump.

3. Bitcoin pulls back significantly, altcoins do too, often pulling back harder.

Note: Individual alts will move at different times. If you make 5x gains on one coin but another has only gone up 10-50% in that time, it's probably a good time to move some profits into the alts which are still going to pump.

Note 2: The above phases can happen in any order multiple times over in a bull run.

then in the mini bull run of 2019 we closed only 2 daily candles in the 11,000s before the local top (6/23/19 and 6/24/19) and we also skipped a close in the 12,000s on the way up.

now in this latest bull run, we closed 20 (yes twenty!) daily candles in the 11,000s and also just closed a daily candle in the 12,000s.

Tricky_Troll,"I think we're going to make a heap of ratio gains in the months leading up to the launch of ETH 2.0 phase 0 due to staking hype. If Bitcoin hits 20K around November, then this would likely coincide with when ETH staking hype peaks. After phase 0 launch and assuming BTC fails to break 20K like it failed to break ATH at the beginning of the last bull run, then BTC will see a pull back before retesting ATH and breaking through sometime in early 2021. Due to the ETH 2.0 hype, I can see the ratio getting back above 0.1 for a few weeks or months before falling back down for a few months when Bitcoin takes the spotlight off ETH as it pushes past 20K. A ratio of 0.1 would put us at almost $2K. Otherwise, a ratio of 0.07 would put us at ATH the same time as BTC. I could see this happening too since there will be strong resistance for ETH at $1,400. If I had to bet though, I think staking hype could push ETH above its ATH before Bitcoin breaks 20K.",g1xkj40,2020-08-18 09:46:53,17

Price was higher for about 40 days back end of 2017. Most of that was a dead cat bounce. 

Maybe 3 areas of resistance looking at the 3 day https://i.imgur.com/STLz2Dv.png

Bull case is over next few months price gets bought up to ATH and then in 2021 we see if the stock to flow model holds true and price hits $100,000

2 weeks till a new monthly candle. If it opens above $13,900 that will be highest ever. https://i.imgur.com/r3D7O82.png above $14,000-$20,000 will be interesting to see the resistance. 

Say 100 world wide companies / hedge funds want to put $250,000,000 each into Bitcoin. At $30,000 that buys 8333 Bitcoins. Which is 9.25 days worth of Bitcoin mined. Those 100 companies buy up 925 days worth of Bitcoins mined if price is at $30,000. 

Lets say there are 15,000,000 active Bitcoins. 1% of the world buys in which is 75 million people. If they all buy 0.2 BTC that is 15 million BTC bought. 0.2 BTC at $100,000 is $20,000. Basically just get 75 million people to set up an automatic $100 Bitcoin buy for each week and leave it for 4 years. 

I think Bitcoin is a giant snowball just getting bigger as more people buy in. The bigger the money that Bitcoin attracts the less people is needed to buy up millions of Bitcoins. 30 millionaires buy 0.5 Bitcoin.

Longer answer: 

The reason some people think it will go to ATH is because of the bust-and-boom cycle that started with Bitcoin and seemed to continue with ETH. Now, that's a small sample size, so it is irrelevant, but some people are desperate for patterns.

Also, with ETH, progress is being made toward a pretty big milestone, Proof of Stake.  This  leads eventually to scaling gains, and in the shorter term, it turns ETH into an income-producing asset.  And all that is happening as corporate adoption is soaring and DeFi is taking off.

Add to that the Federal Reserve money printer and that ETH could act as a hedge against inflation, and you have a perfect storm brewing for an ATH.",g2157f2,2020-08-19 06:00:46,12

TL;DR: ""We don't like Ethereum. It's dangerous for its users because millions of dollars have been lost to contract bugs and scams and you don't warn people about these risks.""

Ultimately, risk management in finance is up to the individual investor. People shouldn't be guided and told what to invest in like they are children if they don't want to be. I think this is one of the things Vitalik mean't when he said Ethereum is freedom. Ethereum is the grown-up's world of finance to traditional finance's walled playground for children. You can do whatever you can dream of in Ethereum but nobody is going to help you if you fall off the jungle jims. Bitcoin created their own walled playground separate from the traditional system but now that true financial freedom was created with Ethereum, they find this world too scary (or they pretend this is the case) so they warn everyone how dangerous it is and instead tell everyone to join them in their own walled off playground which is even more limiting than traditional finance.

Without getting into how bitcoin works technically, I'm sure he understands why people buy gold in times of uncertainty. You could say people have figured out how to take the scarcity of gold and make it digital, so you have all the benefits of a scarce asset, but it's easy to verify the authenticity of it and transport it, kind of like how sending an email has extreme benefits over sending a letter. And no one person is in charge.

I think that concept is easy enough to grasp, it's usually the questions that come after it are from their perspective about authenticating that the above is actually true, and that's where they start asking how it works, which takes a fair amount of time to go through, but it doesn't have to happen in one sitting.",g21or3y,2020-08-19 08:47:30,8

I compared myself to my engineering-school peers: the girl who is already a director of product development, the guy who created some algorithm for trading stocks and sold it for a song, and the idiot who was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and had made it into an entirely gold flatware set. 

The reality of modern capitalism is that hard work doesn’t correlate to more money and more net worth. 

I was hospitalized with a respiratory infection in 2017 because I was too busy to take care of myself. I couldn’t take the time off to see my doctor when I was feeling under the weather, but once my lungs filled with fluid, I ended up in the ICU for a week on high flow oxygen trying to prevent permanent brain damage. I was out of work for 2 months, I broke ribs from coughing, and I wasn’t 100% for about 8 months. 

I pushed myself and jumped back in. I forced myself as if my illness was just another obstacle I could obliterate and prove that I was the best. 

Then I was the best, I was getting the most important projects, tons of praise, and put in front of our client and executive management. I got a promotion and a big raise. I was the golden girl and I was fucking miserable. I was in the office all day, I was so exhausted, I was stopping by Whole Foods and paying too much for dinner and downing a bottle of wine almost every night. I had insomnia and I never was not thinking about work. 

And then I got sick again. Now I was bleeding internally and I was having panic attacks on my 2 mile commute. I was driving my family and friends away, my husband couldn’t figure out how to help me without offending me and my ambition. I started losing my shit in the bathroom and then began openly crying at my desk. 

I was (and am) Financially Independent. My husband and I set our life and living expenses up based on just one salary. We had a solid emergency fund. I am privileged, both of my own making and the situation I was born into. 

So I YOLO quit in January. I told my boss I quit and that I would be happy to onboard the next engineer over the next two weeks. Word got out that I wasn’t leaving for another job; I was leaving because I hated it there. I got mixed reactions, but most were jealous. Most didn’t have the options I have. They begged me to stay, and I slept for the first time in months when I told the Big Boss that there was no title nor amount of money that would change my mind. 

I took about 6 weeks off with no agenda. I went to check out the cute coffee shops I never had the time for. I painted! I read books! I hung out with my mom! I cooked and exercised! I did all the shit I always wanted to do if I didn’t work. 

In February, I had 3 job in offers and I accepted one that was 10% more than what I had been making. I started there a few weeks before COVID and I love it. I intentionally drew boundaries about how long I would work and my new company respected them. 

Where am I going with this... I believe that financial independence is first and foremost because it gives you peace of mind along the journey. Get your emergency fund and set your life up WELL within your means so you can weather the storm. Retiring Early is not guaranteed, even if you have billions in net worth. Bitcoin guy and director girl could get cancer or hit by a car then who really gives a shit how much money they were worth. If you decide to live in a cardboard box until you’re 40 then retire, that is up to you and your values. For me, my shitty job and health made me realize that I want to go out with my husband to nice dinners. I want to wear clothes that fit and make me feel good. I want to pay for the AC because it’s hot as balls in my apartment. 

My values are to spend the time I have with my loved ones. That’s why I choose to be Financially Independent.",g22701z,2020-08-19 11:33:14,34

TA analysts HAVE to try models used to predict traditional assets. This does not work... at least not as well as it does with established markets that have a long history and relatively stable user base.

What most people miss is that the overhead of saturation is enormous compared to established technologies. The saturation for newcomers to the crypto market has barely scratched the surface. And the saturation for new users of Bitcoin has also barely scratched the surface. 3% of investors own gold. Bitcoin being not only an accounting system for a value store, but also a digital currency, app based liquidation, easy to send anywhere on earth, aligned to a digital society, etc means the ownership will likely dwarf gold's ownership. So basically, just have patience.

If you're stressing over a 5 or 10 percent drop in price, just stay the course.

2. Decentralized and crowd funded. Gold is top down and over regulated by a slow moving establishment. USD is heavily influenced by the Federal Reserve, which is a private company controlled by a very small and hidden group. Bitcoin gives the global population the ability to build the global reserve of the future.
3. The separation of currency and state. There's no natural law that says the government should control and manipulate reserve currencies. A free market reserve with the properties of Bitcoin leads to a financial source of truth that can be used as the foundation for measuring value. In a world of increasing financial relativism where the value of assets is disconnected from the fundamentals, a global source of truth creates certainty.

Ultimately the number doesn't matter too much as the market will price in the supply and demand. What matters is the fact that there is a limit, there is scarcity that is open , predictable , and agreed upon beforehand and not manipulated by corrupt Central planners like fiat or some altcoins (even popular ones) do.

-------------------

&gt; what kind of economy would it create?

Bitcoin in this sense is a bit of an experiment and is already disproving some incorrect economic assumptions suggested by Keynesian economists, namely the fear-mongering of the ""deflationary death spiral"" where the opposite has occurred during periods of high appreciation/deflation. More spending and charitable giving occurs during these times. 

We will see in time , but my general sense is that Bitcoin will become more stable and less volatile with a higher market cap and more liquidity and encourage more saving, more conscientious consumerism and longer term investing, and wiser use of capital.

&gt;Lets say the population has grown substantially without enough bitcoin to go around

This will not happen. Bitcoin can already be divided by 1/1000 of a sat in payment channels today. Divisibility for a unit of account to buy your daily coffee should never be a concern",g26btd8,2020-08-20 12:04:14,9

When I send some Bitcoin Cash to that address, the bot then notifies the person I'm tipping that they've been tipped. It also sends them a message with instructions. In order to claim the tip, they need to download a Bitcoin Cash wallet and then send their own address to the bot, which will then forward the tip to their new wallet.

If they don't claim the tip within a week, the bot sends the funds back to my wallet. It's a pretty good system! I'll tip you from this comment (which I can do just by mentioning the bot, like I did above) and, if you'd like to check it out, you can download a wallet and claim the tip. No pressure though!

bitusher,"&gt;heard anyone explain why the cap is set at 21 million. Rather than 19 or 35.

Some educated guesses why satoshi chose 21 million-

1) One theory is that at the time of Satoshi’s decision to use 21 million as the finite number of Bitcoin, the global M1 money supply stood at approximately $21 trillion. In economics, this is the global money supply that includes physical currency and coins, demand deposits, traveller's checks, other checkable deposits

2) “I wanted to pick something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but without knowing the future, that’s very hard. I ended up picking something in the middle,” Nakamoto said. “If Bitcoin remains a small niche,” he added, “it’ll be worth less per unit than existing currencies. If you imagine it being used for some fraction of world commerce, then there’s only going to be 21 million coins for the whole world, so it would be worth much more per unit.”

3)  Some believe that Bitcoin‘s 21 million limit was arbitrarily set by Nakamoto when he made two key decisions. That Bitcoin should add new blocks to its blockchain every 10 minutes (on average) and that the reward paid to miners halves every 210,000 blocks – roughly every 4 years.

4) ""A total of 174,100 tonnes of gold have been mined in human history, according to GFMS as of 2012.2 This is roughly equivalent to 5.6 billion troy ounces or, in terms of volume, about 9261 m3, or a cube **21.0 m on a side**.""

5) 50x210,000(1+1/2+1/4+1/8+1/16....) or 

50*210,000(2) = 21,000,000 is a nice clean equation to code and mathematically concise 

6) It helps avoid errors on most computer systems, and, is likely sufficient for all possible transactions everywhere.

My first bet would be those Tesla shares they bought for 700 that are now worth 2000 or more.",g296ui5,2020-08-21 05:47:37,7

An attacker would likely need the equivalent of 1 million of these machines, which would cost somewhere in the range of 3 billion dollars, and they would also need a ton of electricity to run all their miners.

Based on our previous feedback survey, there has been a sudden interest in DeFi, and understanding valid gold comparisons. We will analyze the decentralized finance market to provide you with a better understanding between trend valuations and accurate valuations. Lastly, we will discuss the characteristic similarities for fungibility and privacy. Considering many crypto-assets claims to be private, only a privacy-by-default cryptocurrency such as Monero can be digitally fungible. We will break down various fundamentals between Bitcoin and Monero when using crypto-assets as an economic hedge.

Before Bitcoin, the solution was to maintain a centralized database, not unlike the ledger of accounts that any bank must keep.  All transactions need to be cleared through that database.  The problem was that meant there was a centralized database, and a company in charge of it, and the government could come and shut it down.

The key advance of Bitcoin was to solve the double-spend problem in a decentralized fashion, with no central servers to confiscate and no company to threaten legally.

LiquidCracker,"Missed out on luck is what it primarily is. You can rationalize with hindsight bias that you should have known, and you’ll run into many lucky people who “knew all along and had the foresight,” but for everyone in the latter category, there are many more who called it wrong or timed it wrong (e.g., “bitcoin straight to $100k”). 

You should try to give yourself educated chances to get lucky, but don’t blame yourself for not being lucky. I mean, you could have played roulette and bet on black 5 times in a row that time you saw it hit and gotten 32x your money, but you don’t kick yourself for not doing that, do you?

P.S. if you think Tesla is currently NOT overvalued, then you may disagree with this line of thinking and may just have an entirely different worldview than me.

Izrud,"A few words of wisdom to my fellow omisebros and omisegals.

&amp;nbsp;

Only you can decide what's best for you. Maybe that's taking some profits, maybe it's holding longer. There is no wrong answer here, because no one can predict the future. 

&amp;nbsp;

If you have waited this long (3+ years for some of us), do you honestly think this is the end of the road for OMG? That it won't go higher than this? That when Coinbase and Binance and Bittrex and Kraken all transfer to OMG for their tether volume, more people wouldn't want a piece of those watcher rewards? That when Omise clients start onboarding that won't cause interest in asian markets? From what I can tell the good news is just starting to come out. Whether it takes 3 weeks or another 3 years, some of us would greatly benefit with sitting with our asses firmly on our hands and far away from the sell button. 

&amp;nbsp;

Conversly, boy I held so many alts from ATH's to 95% down. At every turn I would convince myself that a 500% run up was just around the corner. Whether it was ETF's, wasltreet money, chinese new years, halvings... God i always knew it was bullshit, but deep down I secretly wanted to be wrong. And it cost me to go in debt. And it cost me sleep. And cost me happiness. It cost a hell of a lot more than what I think any money is worth in terms of stress. I won't get that time back ever again. But I can always make a little more money later. So be kind to yourself. Take whatever out you need to cover any oustanding debts. If you have credit cards pay them off. Anything higher interest than %3 should be a major goal in life to get rid off. 

&amp;nbsp;

Thirdly maybe you want to stay in the game, but diversify a little bit. Boy wouldn't it be nice to have 1 whole Bitcoin, 32 ETH AND some left over OMG's? It's not like BTC won't have another run. We all know it's just a matter of time, and being diversified sure helps you sleep better at night. Maybe it won't cause you to have another evening of seeing your profits triple, quadruple, etc in one evening. But on a long enough scale of time - it is sure to pay off eventually while getting some considerable stress off your shoulders. 

&amp;nbsp;

Again - **YOU CANNOT PREDICT THE FUTURE**. Make whatever is the best choice for you now. Today. And while it's ok to look at the past and learn from your mistakes - don't dwell on them. 

&amp;nbsp;

Good night omisebros and omisegals, I'm going to sleep before I have a heart attack watching the price go between $7 and $9 every 30 seconds.",g2anebc,2020-08-21 13:40:43,32

My chart shows a weekly bearish divergence which based on previous times it has been triggered more often than not results in a 15-20% move down, with that is also a 0 on the weekly HVP which usually guarantees some sort of large weekly move since the price action volatility is at an all time low and will eventually expand when the move comes. Not to mention the stochs coming down if we stay below say 12k and the rsi being rejected from the bullish control zone.

mortuusmare,"Just so you are aware the article you linked is from July 2019 and was heavily debunked.

With ORV (Open Representative Voting) similar to DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) it is the users who decide who to allocate their voting weight to. Some people won't like to admit it, but Nano as well as cryptocurrency as a whole is in its infancy. There are currently 88 principle representatives on the Nano network who have enough voting power to broadcast votes ([source](https://nanocrawler.cc/network)). You are absolutely right in that the large amount of that voting weight is allocated to a few big reps, 3 reps have about 33% of the voting weight according to [MyNanoNinja](https://mynano.ninja/principals), Nanovault, Nanowallet and Binance. This is because two of these are early wallets that created reps and many still have their voting weight allocated to them. The last is Binance. Binance has their own principle representative so they have assigned all the Nano that they are in custody of to their own rep.

**This is an issue**. However, is it one that should become less of a problem over time. These reps had more voting weight last year, then Kraken listed Nano and created their own Principle rep, this reduced the voting weight that the top 3 had and now Kraken has 4% weight. As more exchanges list Nano and set up their own principle representatives the more the voting weight should even out. If Coinbase list Nano, they'll almost certainly set up their own principle rep which will see another drastic reallocation of voting-weight, spreading it out further.
 
But its not just exchanges. If a company really likes the idea of accepting Nano for their product/services because they could save ~3% in card or PayPal fees they would feel incentivized to help secure the network by setting up their own Principle Reps. Then you have the hobbyists who don't mind paying ~$50 a month to help secure the network. There doesn't need to be a financial incentive regardless of what the POW maximalists or stakers say. 

&gt; Gold doesn't rely on people to do the right thing. Bitcoin doesn't rely on people to do the right thing

Wikipedia doesn't pay their contributors. The contributors write, research and fact-check articles *because they want to*.  Modders for videogames release their mods to the community free of charge *because they want to*. People seed torrents *because they want to*. Crypto enthusiasts may want to set up principle representatives with no financial incentive to help secure the network *because they want to*.

Also, it's in the best interest of cryptocurrency exchanges and retail companies who have principle representatives to **secure** the network. It would make no sense to collude with other companies to get 51% voting-weight, manipulate the network for a few hours before people starting changing the reps. It would ruin their reputation and their business would consequently suffer. The financial gains from doing so would be peanuts compared to if they hadn't done so.",g2i18eb,2020-08-23 03:28:49,11
Qwahzi,"A couple of points in rebuttal:

- Nano's Nakamoto Coefficient (the number of entities required to collude to attempt a 51% attack) is the same as Bitcoin's:  https://twitter.com/patrickluberus/status/1292532679716601858

- Nano representatives are different from Bitcoin mining pools because they do NOT have control over the blockchain. They cannot reverse, modify, or double spend transactions, even with &gt;50% vote weight. This is partially because of Nano's block-lattice ledger data structure, where every account has its own blockchain that *only the owner can modify*

- Nano nodes *locally* make their own protocol decisions, and cement blocks (mark as irreversible) after they have achieved confirmation. Even if there was a 51% attack after the fact, your node would not reverse the transaction because that breaks the protocol rules (confirmed transactions can't be reversed). Compare this to Bitcoin, where enough hashrate can always reverse Bitcoin transactions. Hell, there was a [1-conf double spend](https://twitter.com/BitMEXResearch/status/1221681807881424898) in January. That's why exchanges make you wait 6-confs minimum, but even that could be theoretically reversed because Bitcoin uses probabilistic finality

- Nano's consensus mechanism allows users to remotely re-delegate their vote weight to anyone at any time, and gives the *users* of the protocol the control. Compare that to Bitcoin where miner and user desires can be at odds (e.g. maximum profit vs minimum fees), and it requires a lot more effort to relocate a physical Bitcoin mining farm

- To even attempt a 51% attack on Nano, you'd have to buy a huge amount of supply, probably pushing Nano's price to beyond Bitcoin's. And all for what, to destroy the value of the Nano you just purchased? Remember that you can't modify, double spend, or reverse transactions, even with majority vote weight",g2i3ojs,2020-08-23 03:43:45,11

Qwahzi,"- It's not apples to oranges, because 1) a 51% attack on Nano also requires a huge amount of capital, which is at risk of being made worthless when the attack fails, 2) Nano representatives also represent hundreds or thousands of individual Nano users, 3) even with &gt;50% of vote weight they can't reverse transactions (the big risk with a 51% attack in Bitcoin), 4) they could not effortlessly control the network forever because honest participants can lower their threshold and the only chains that would be stalled would be the attacker chains that attempt double spends

- A 51% attack with Bitcoin mining pools can also censor transactions or addresses

- 1-conf [is risky](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Irreversible_Transactions#How_many_confirmations_are_required). [Kraken](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/203325283-Cryptocurrency-deposit-processing-times) requires 6 confs, [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/support/articles/360030775291) requires 2, [Coinbase](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/sending-or-receiving-cryptocurrency/why-is-my-transaction-pending) requires 3

- Coin distribution gets better over time with more adoption and more exchanges, but at least Nano users even have some control. In Bitcoin, most people are dependent on whatever the majority mining hashrate decides

- Binance + Kraken + Kucoin + Bitgrail is still not enough to achieve &gt;50% vote weight on Nano. Also, the majority of Bitcoin hashrate is located in an authoritarian country, and it's much harder to relocate mining hashrate than it is to remotely redelegate vote weight",g2ibyvw,2020-08-23 04:30:09,11

csb06,"I think blockchain can be viewed as a failed tech solution to a problem that is more social than technological. Bitcoin, for example, is a system that tries to decentralize the process of transferring funds in order to grant anonymity and remove power from the centralized banking/credit card/payment processing companies.

However, this only led to a new establishment of ""middlemen"" or centralized third parties that handle the transactions. Most people that use Bitcoin use some kind of third party software or service to interact with it, and as the article says, a handful of companies dominate the process of mining. The social problem - the mistrust in private institutions that act as middlemen to financial transactions - did not go away. Instead, there are now new middlemen who handle most transactions. There may be more visible checks for consistency than in the banking system, but it still hinges on placing trust in the third party intermediaries you use to do your transactions. And now there is the additional problem of tremendous energy inefficiency.

The ideal solution would be to leave the tech as it is (centralized databases that manage accounts and check for consistency) but instead reform the *social structures* that control this valuable data. The financial system could be publicly owned and operated, with open-source code and democratic oversight instead of leaving it in the hands of private companies with opaque security practices/data sharing policies/codebases. Guarantees for safety could be encoded into law and be verified to be met, since the tech would be available for anyone to inspect.

I get that these kinds of social reforms don't exist now, so they aren't an immediate alternative to blockchain-based systems. But I think that programmers/engineers too often think that technology alone can replace old social structures, when in fact new technology without corresponding social change only replicates the current social structures.",g2is0ex,2020-08-23 06:32:36,23

This is of course only one concern, the amount of data that's collected can be used by almost any company to inform their decisions. You probably know about targeted advertising, but that's the tip of the iceberg. Your insurance provider can evaluate your risk based on who you associate with, the sort of information they're not allowed to ask when you apply, but information they can acquire anyways. Search China's social credit score program for an extreme example.

Personally I think the only real protection other than legislation (which holds dubious effect over intelligence agencies and law enforcement) is consumer encryption. If only you hold the key, they need a warrant to see your shit. And more and more apps (e.g. whatsapp) use protocols that prevent the server from ever being able to decrypt your messages. Only the sender or the recipient can do that, which again requires the authorities to get a warrant to read them, assuming they don't have a backdoor in your phone, however police departments almost certainly do not. Intelligence agencies probably don't, especially in Android because it's open source, but it's possible. As for protection of stuff other than records, well you're probably still going need to use the web, and almost every website has google or facebook (or both) tracking you, so you're kinda stuffed.

JustAWildTurtle,"Another favourite (see /u/peterquest and /u/MoreCowbellMofo using it in this very thread) of theirs is the:

""Yeah but actually the global banking industry uses a ton of energy besides raw server costs for the transaction mainframes, Bitcoin is more efficient if you include those"".

So let us be nice and actually humour the point:

So first, let us grab some numbers.

* [Digiconomist tells us Bitcoin consumes roughly 66.5TWh per year](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/)

* [Visa, per it's corporate responsibility report has used 711,268
GJ of energy in 2018, or a ~0.1976 TWh per year rate](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/download/corporate-responsibility/visa-2018-corporate-responsibility-report.pdf)

* [Blockchain.com tells us the exact amount of transactions in the last 24h: _311,179_ at time of writing](https://www.blockchain.com/charts)

* [Visa claims a transaction capacity of _65,000 per second_ or ~5,616,000,000 per day](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/download/corporate/media/visanet-technology/aboutvisafactsheet.pdf)

If we take this last claim at face value, we get the following math: (God bless Wolfram alpha and it's ability to cope with arbitrary units)

||Transactions / day|Energy use|Energy per transaction (Transaction throughput / Energy use)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|VISA|5,616,000,000|0.1976 TWh|347.03 Joule / Transaction|
|Bitcoin|311,179|66.5TWh|2,108,000,000 Joule / Transaction|

(And for those comparing with the comments above, Bitcoin is at ~585kWh per transaction, so the 906kWh figure is a little high.)

Okay so a ""65,000 per second"" figure is both ludicrously optimistic and ignores that Visa's energy use will soar if it actually has to deal with that many transactions.

Let's knock that down to the more commonly cited figure of ""1500/second"" or 129,600,000/day and re-run the numbers.

||Transactions / day|Energy use|Energy per transaction (Transaction throughput / Energy use)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|VISA|129,600,000|0.1976 TWh|15,038 Joule / Transaction|
|Bitcoin|311,179|66.5TWh|2,108,000,000 Joule / Transaction|

Mhm. Still not making a dent.

But hey, Visa doesn't just handle transactions itself, it interfaces with the broader financial system that uses a ton more energy, so let's instead compare those numbers:

* Unfortunately, ""The entire financial industry"" doesn't publish their energy consumption numbers, so instead let's linearly (as we're comparing per-transaction) scale Bitcoin to their transaction throughput, and see how much energy the financial industry were to use if it were as efficient as Bitcoin is.

* [Capgemini puts the amount of global non-cash transactions at 538.6 billion in 2017](https://www.capgemini.com/es-es/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2019/09/World-Payments-Report-WPR-2019.pdf)

So, 585kWh times 538 billion is uh... _314,730 TWh_ used by the ""global financial industry at Bitcoin-efficiency level""

... This doesn't really say much on it's own. How much energy are we even talking about. I'm sure our friends at [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/energy) will be able to provide some context...

Let's see, global energy consumption in 2019 was ~159,000TWh, or roughly half our theoretical financial industry estimate.

Last I checked there's no Visa branded dyson sphere around the sun, so we can reasonably surmise that the financial industry is at least _twice_ as energy efficient per transaction as Bitcoin.

---

... Still here? Have a bonus:

So, thing about Bitcoin and likewise cryptocurrencies is that their transaction fees are a free market, and the transaction capacity is quite scarce by nature of that capacity having a hard ceiling.

The economic result of this is that the equilibrium towards which transaction fees increase is the utility value of the transaction; The user pays exactly what utility value they gained from sending the transaction, thus gaining net-zero value.

Which would normally be fine; Such markets are still a positive-sum-game for humanity as those providing the service reap profits. However, with cryptocurrency mining there is another aspect: There is a horrible tragedy of the commons at play.

Miners are allocated money from transaction fees based on the amount of hashrate (=computer work) they contribute. This functions as a 1:1 share; If you contribute 5% of the total hashrate of Bitcoin, you get 5% of the transaction fees.

Any individual miner can thusly only increase their profits by increasing the hashrate they have, and well, they readily do this. ([Blockchain.com has a chart where you can see this happen](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate))

And this is by design; As the collective hashrate increases, the network becomes harder to attack.

_But_, increasing hashrate does not increase the total transaction throughput (and thus collective transaction fees), the pool from which miners get paid remains the same. This means that the profit margins shrink, as the cost of mining does increase with increased hashrate.

And where does this rat-race of increasing hashrate hit equilibrium? _A profit margin of barely above 0%_; All transaction fees flow straight to the energy production companies.

Who, by the way, are also incentivized to lower their costs to barely above 0% profit; Miners will move to the cheapest electricity and are a huge consumer.

Thus the end result, at equilibrium, Bitcoin costs it's users exactly what value it provides; Being of net-zero benefit to them. Yet it also is of negligible profit to it's miners, who spend almost all of their earnings on electricity bills. And not even the energy companies see profits, as they compete each-other's profits away.

A massive digital hole-digging-and-filling system, currently valued at ... [roughly $200 billion.](https://coinmarketcap.com/)

Because there's gonna be a few people asking: Conventional financial systems avoid this ""net-neutral-value equilibrium"" problem by simply _increasing capacity_. A bank transaction costs you far less than it's utility to you; Should the bank ever significantly increase their prices, you'd just go to another bank that'll do it for cheaper.

Bakounin,"After reading all the comments to your question, it seems to me that a lot of people have problem remembering what do we need to use Visa/Mastercard cards for. 

""We need them to buy goods and services online !!!""

I bought my first Bitcoins for one and only one reason, to buy things that I wanted on Silk Road. I beleive most of the people in 2011-2013 that bought Bitcoins, did it for the same exactly reason. I didnt care about the wonders of the DLT technology that Bitcoin brought to this world, neither did most of the other people. People cared enough to get some magical Internet money as that was the only way for them to get the they wanted. Simply put it was the usecase that attracted them.


I jumped on the Crypto crazyness wagon after the Cyprus-related Bitcoin pump, the greed drove me there and that is what still keeps me here. I firmly believe that this is the case for a lot of people in the cryptosphere. Some even wrap their greed in a cognitive dissonance of a true best DLT seeker. All rubish, we all want to get rich or/and remain rich. Since 2013 I have heard myriads of claims about the usefulness of the Bitcoin and other crypto projects, and jumped/switched/diversified to many different DLTs promising to take over the world with their fastest or the most secure or the most scalable tech. All very interesting and promising but GREED was my main driver and still is.

I will reply to the OP from the position not of a crypto investor but from the position of normal people that I have tried to convince to join the ""Crypto Revolution"" during the last 7 years. Literally nothing other than ""you might get super rich"" was attractive to most of them. The digitalization (at least in the Western countries) has made everything extreamly easy and thus most of modern and quite impressive DLT solutions remain unattractive to the general public. It is again mostly the GREED that fuels the new-commers to the cryptoshere and I presume that is why Bitcoin's selling point have switched from becoming the world currency to becoming a SoV, a hedge against the fiat inflation. 

So what do normies need to enter the cryptosphere other than greed?

They need a REASON to use them. DLT solutions need to offer them an easy, and if possible, the only way and of doing something that they NEED or WANT. In the same spirit to what attracted me personally to Bitcoin. Crypto projects need to offer products or services that people need and hesitate or cant use their Visa. Not technical advantages but a real usecase to address peoples needs. A lot of DLT solutions offer many increadible advantages against Visa payments but those still remain relatively unattractive to the normies. Say for example the privacy coins, they offer a huge advantage for the DNM but look at the statistics:

https://medium.com/@eliezer.ndinga/the-state-of-privacy-coins-b873982acbe4

The vast majority of users use BTC and continue doing so despite the myriads of arrests. Looking at the study one might speculate that a simple reason for that could be, that most of DNMs accept only BTC, with only a few of them accepting XMR and nothing else. So maybe if the DNMs accepted more privacy coins people would use them more often. 

Now extrapolating that to the normies, if the clear web ecommerce platforms would start accepting privacy coins, that would potentially be a great reason to attract normies. As Visa or other regular digital payments do not offer privacy. A real usecase, something that adds a tangible value to digital coins. 

The same study contains something that may support my hypothesis and possibly even a local EMH. The study questions the users and most of them despite using BTC are aware of privacy coins and actually own some. One surpising result, according to the authors, is that the 3rd most held privacy coin was Particl, even though its not accepted on any of DNMs. 

So a looot of privacy coins out there, so what is up ? Why this one ? After checking the Particl Project I discovered that they have developed a privacy-focused decentralized marketplace. Digging a bit more into the tech and what it provides, it seems it is way ahead not only of all the current DNMs but also of the promises from the new tech coming from the Russian Hydra market. I guess the DNM users somehow were aware of that. 

Now the true potential of such technology is not its privacy features or anything related to DLT. The true potential is that it allows the normies to buy easily, freely and privately products and services. So what if in my quest to convince people to join cryptos, I could ignore mentioning the word crypto and simply point out to them an interesting market on the Particl's marketplace. What would happen then? Well I think the same people after looking at a potentially attractive product would return back to me with a simple question, how do I buy things there! 

So I think usecases like that is what the cryptosphere needs to attract normies. A rule of thumb evaluating a DLT solution for attracting normies could be:
""Point out a DLT solution existance to normies, without any convincing that they need it. If they get what they need or comeback asking for help to get it, then the DLT its has a tangible value""",g2lrnc0,2020-08-24 02:29:22,5

butactuallythough,"u/HarryPFlashman is pointing out that if electricity was free, the cost of crypto mining would be paid for by taxpayers.

Because it is designed this way, bitcoin mining takes increasingly more processing power and/or time to get the same results as in the past. In the beginning you were able to mine bitcoins with single desktop PCs (albeit slowly), which didn't cost much in electricity.

As more and more bitcoins were mined, the availability of mining new bitcoins decreased, which meant miners had to start building specialized rigs based on GPUs, otherwise they would be spending more money on the electricity to mine a bitcoin than the actual value of the bitcoin itself.

Since GPUs are expensive, the cost of mining bitcoins became even more prohibitive since it took many more GPUs and much more electricity to mine a bitcoin than it used to. If electricity bills were paid by tax funds, mining rigs would pay for themselves and make miners wealthy at cost to the taxpayers.",g2n3s4d,2020-08-24 09:20:51,5

rockspapersscissors,"All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day. I await the furious fussilade of odious obluquies and belittling bombast in the comments below.

MobTwo,"I can't wait for November to be over so that we can move on without a dictator enforcing his own terms on the chain. Looking at the positive interactions between the multiple node implementations (with the exception of Bitcoin ABC) has given me lots of hope, optimism, and sense of happiness over the long term future of Bitcoin Cash. I know some people may feel worried and cautious and that's normal because over the last 4 years, Bitcoin ABC had created such a toxic environment. Even recently, their supporters are spreading FUD to increase fear and uncertainties in the community. Even Vermorel, the guy who is always missing from Bitcoin Cash only to appear once a blue moon to sing praises for Amaury while attacking other BCH developers is active again, writing a smear hit piece using false accusations to harm the reputation of other BCH developers.

Like I said, I can't wait for November to be over so that everyone else can start making real progress which Bitcoin ABC had been obstructing over the last 4 years.

&gt; There have been tons of attempts at scaling that have been done, just none that have made it into Bitcoin ABC. That's because Amaury has generally stonewalled all attempts at scaling. He rejected my proposal to fix the recursivemutex issue with the source code (I recommended a switch to readers/writers (shared) mutexes), which makes the code difficult to parallelize. He sabotaged my attempts to develop Xthinner. He sabotaged Shammah's attempts to fix the O(n2) transaction chain issue. He opposed mainnet stress testing, and has not supported testnet stress testing, and ignored my own testnet/regtest stress tests. He has put no resources into scaling at all.

&gt; Bitcoin Unlimited has done a ton of scaling work, as has Flowee. I think Flowee was tested with 10k tx/sec a while ago. BU added Graphene v2 and parallelized almost everything. But BCH is only as fast as the slowest node.

&gt; The reason why there seems to be an ""anti-ABC mob"" is because a lot of us who have been paying close attention have noticed a pattern of subtle but heavy manipulation, sabotage, and power games from Amaury (and consequently, from ABC as a whole). But because he's usually pretty good at keeping his manipulation subtle, it only gets noticed by the devs and the people that he's attacking or manipulating. This makes them seem like they're crazy, and so they usually get sidelined. Amaury comes out of each conflict as the hero and the victor, and his credibility goes up whereas his enemies go down.

ObiTwoKenobi,"I think the ""Store-of-Value"" and ""Global-Economic-System"" arguments are going to be heavily tested.

There really are only two likely scenarios:

- Trump wins; short-term the stock market gravy train keeps going, and we ride along with the US Stock Market as they overexert the system and run it into the ground. Trump already tweeted negatively about Bitcoin and crypto once. He's surrounded by a surprising amount of ""pro-crypto"" people, so they might be able to steer him towards the light. Long-term: the US Economy goes bankrupt and melts down.

- Biden wins; Trump contests results and will use any legal, and also illegal, means to generate as much pandemonium as possible. You'll for sure see accusations of voter fraud, planted evidence, undercover cameras, all of it. The US dollar crashes against the Euro, turmoil for a couple of months, eventually the adults take over and the healing begins. If crypto can hold its ground against the USD we could see moon prices sooner rather than later (albeit they'll mostly be as a result of the devalued).

Crypto Markets had a test of these arguments during the COVID-crash of March, and they shit the bed completely (worth noting; so did Gold fwiw). A second test within 9 months might work out better?

Just because Core hobson-jobsoned some kind of bizarre, overly complex contraption (Segwit) on top does not make it the same as a simple blocksize increase.

Let's be honest: Segwit was created specifically to favor Lightning Network and Liquid (which I would argue are also failures as evidenced by Ethereum's superior scaling on layer 2, with more BTC locked up than even Bitcoin's own LN).

Here's what happened: The developers on Core *compromised*, took money and ever since had a conflict of interest. LN and Liquid has been their goal for a long time. They don't want people scaling unless it's with their products and unless it benefits them.

Nagosh,"So my buy at 11,200 got hit and I'm back in my long that I sold at 11,520, so not bad overall. To me, there aren't any patterns and I doubt a reversal will happen here. I think we are just chopping sideways. 

I think trying to make any predictions is a fool's errand but that is what we are here to do so I guess I'll just put my thoughts down.

I think the market overall is more bullish than bearish, i.e. people are more likely to buy and hold then to sell so I view this as consolidation, and I don't think it'll take as long to move up as 9k. Especially with sentiment this low (futures premium is the lowest it's been in weeks, possibly months) and we're still maintaining &gt;11k, I think we'll have at most another month of sideways in this range. If we can maintain a &gt;11k price for another month I'll hesitantly up my leverage to maybe 10x. 

**Pure baseless speculation just for fun** \- Fractals are just as predictive as any other TA (that is to say not very predictive), but many are using comparisons to 2016 to predict future price action. While it is entirely possible that we may hit ATH and then plummet down 30% like in 2016, I'm going to take the contrarian position and say that probably won't happen. I think many, like I was, are expecting something like that to happen. It's possible, maybe even likely now, that we just move through ATH slowly and steadily with low volatility. 

I'm also going to increase my expected bubble top to 300-350k. I wrote previously that I think the top would be around 200-300k, but with inflation possibly going through the roof I wanted to adjust my expected top. I may still start scaling out at 200k but it entirely depends on the velocity we get there. In 2017 the price doubled in a month. This next bubble could be the same in that we could spend months trying to clear 50k, 100k, 150k, and then only weeks to clear 200k, 250k, and 300k. When we start getting weekly returns of 30-40% we'll know we're reaching the top.

As I said before, though, the absolute top will be w/e gold's market cap is. I think right now if Bitcoin has gold's market cap it would be around 400k a coin. This will be the driver of the next bubble. Everyone is going to want to get in because of headlines like ""Bitcoin *is definitely going to be* the new gold so buy now and get 100's of % returns!,"" etc., but after that hype is gone we pop.",g2v6h28,2020-08-26 10:33:56,17

Merlin560,"PNF Chart Update

[PnF Chart Here](https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/pnf.php?c=%24BTCUSD,PWTADANRNO[PA][D][F1!3!!!2!20])

Yesterday the drop put us into a low pole warning situation.  This occurs when the price drops 4 boxes below the breakdown point.  It reflects that the price is dropping beyond what is “expected”.  In an EILIF wording, it overshot the bottom.

When this happens the reversal and bounce are often fast and significant.  It is the rule of thumb that the price, when it reverses, will move up 50% of the column where it settles down.

As of right now (10:49 AM, EDT the price $11,466) the price climbed up that low pole 7 boxes on a 13 box column.  So that is a “text book” rebound.

I know there are people reading this saying, “OK, you are great at predicting what has already happened.”  I plead guilty to that.  

But this is my explanation:

I post these to reflect how to read the charts.  When you recognize what is happening in the chart it is possible to make some pretty good predictions as to where its going.  For example, we saw a break down yesterday.  Looking at the chart I predicted a low of 11,150.  When it got in that area it created the low pole.  If you were shorting, that is where you should have started closing down your trade.  If you were waiting for a reversal (up 3 boxes from the low point) you could have played the Low Pole Reversal and picked up $200-250 on the price.

PNF Charting gives you ranges and potential movements.  Unfortunately it doesn’t tell you “when”.  But a brief 3-5 minute review the chart every morning will give you the “targets” you should have in your head when looking at the price.

So, right now we are in a column of Xs.  If the price drops below 11,000 today that column is moot and we go bak to the long pole (the chart “sets” at the daily close—which is 00:00 UTC.). The formation is 4 columns wide.  Any move up should be marginal.    

Shooting up from a low pole is usually a couple day event—if it is going to break out, the price must rise above 11,800.  The peak of that break would be about four boxes, or 12,000….again.

The trend is still upwards and a reversal is currently in the 8,000 range.  I am very confident we won’t see a $3k crash today.  (From my fingers to God’s ears!)

Here is the PnF overview for those of you new to the process:

[PnF Charting Explanation and Primer](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/03/081303.asp)

This charting method can be taught to 5th graders.  I read the book on the process and there was a chapter of how it works, and how it was taught to a class of 5th graders.  Over the period they discussed, the 5th graders beat the index percentages by a lot.  

It is simple.  It removes noise.  And it gives easy to understand parameters and good, basic targeting abilities.

A personal aside--no more bitcoin stuff here:

For those who have asked, I wanted to thank you for checking in about my family.  Today marks 1 year since my wife’s surgery and diagnosis with pancreatic cancer.  It was also the day my Mom passed.  It has been a year of lows, lowers, and lowest.  But, I am happy to say that my wife is cancer free, back and work, and appreciative of the good feelings sent her way.

Thanks for asking.  I know we don’t “know” you guys.  But it is nice to have people asking and passing along good thoughts.  

If you have never been in my position, let me tell you—every word of encouragement means a lot.  If you do not reach to folks you know in these situations because you don’t know what to say, just say “I am thinking of you, I hope you are OK.”  

Its funny, I was kind of surprised at the number of ""friends"" who disappeared over the past year.   They heard the news; said they were sorry; and then they were ghosts.  Mostly because they did not know what to say.  I am telling you, it doesn't matter what you say.  Just BE there to listen and be ""normal.""

&gt;I’m the guy who went over the blockchain stuff in Satoshi’s first cut of the bitcoin code. Satoshi didn’t have a 1MB limit in it. The limit was originally Hal Finney’s idea. Both Satoshi and I objected that it wouldn’t scale at 1MB. Hal was concerned about a potential DoS attack though, and after discussion, Satoshi agreed. The 1MB limit was there by the time Bitcoin launched. But all 3 of us agreed that 1MB had to be temporary because it would never scale.

decibels42,"I see a large focus in your post on “on chain governance.” Take a look at my post below before replying, but how do you reconcile my issue with on chain governance at the base layer?

In my view, the base layer of a chain should be as absolutely simple as possible and hardened over time. Then, on top of that base layer, all kinds of systems can be built out (voting included).

Imo, for Polkadot, in the best case, I see it as too unpredictable for high value use cases to depend on it (I can’t trust a base layer/central chain that can change its rules and create inconsistency under me). At worst, the voting power either remains majority dominated/centralized by the founders (there’s been 3 rounds of VC investing, aside from the Web3/Parity holdings), or it becomes “bought” by future investors who will control the narrative and dominate the direction of the chain (ala Blockstream and Bitcoin).

Also, Vitalik has written extensively with the issues of on chain governance (he’s in favor of other solutions, potentially quadratic voting). I can’t really see how it’s anything but a gimmick for large scale base layer chains that should be primarily focused on achieving consensus and pumping out new blocks.",g2xsjjv,2020-08-27 03:46:02,9

InLimbo21,"A lot of people skeptical of this rally and I don't blame them. We were in a brutal bear market for a few years and it sucked. Can we drop below 10500 (the breakout point) sure -- it's bitcoin but I wouldn't expect more than a wick. 11k-12.4k or so is just a trading range. A lot of people missed 3800 - 9000 buying zone and are waiting for a ""bigger"" dip which I don't think will come. We had 2+ years to accumulate. 

From a macro perspective on the markets I think all asset classes are going to melt-up in the next few months leading up until the election. We have the Fed speaking tomorrow and its expected he will let the market know that inflation will be allowed to run ""hot"" until the economy recovers. This is a massive policy change and will buoy the markets. 

We also have the catalyst of the 2 trillion+ stimulus bill in early September which will be MASSIVE. People have forgot about the bill because congress is useless and has been purposely dragging their feet. Make no mistake they will pass something and it will be bigger than you expect. Yes there's going to be 1200$ cheques again that will go into Bitcoin and Robinhood accounts. 

The last factor that will melt-up all asset classes will be more ""vaccine"" news. They'll announce the vaccine passed stage 3 and will be ready by the end of the year or early next year. Make no mistake a vaccine will not fix this mess of an economy but it will boost markets in short term. 

Do not short the S&amp;P or Bitcoin. This will go further than you think. My targets are 4200-4500 on S&amp;P and $20,000-$22000 on Bitcoin by early November (before the election). This is a blow-off top in equity markets and will be the top for 10+ years. Wave 2 corona in the winter, undecided election (recount, ""voter fraud"" etc..), and economy hopium wearing off will be the cause of the crash. Bitcoin will have a 40-50% correction but buy the dip. Stocks gonna be ugly. Gold, miners and Bitcoin will be the place to be this decade.

Remora_101,"Good read!


&gt;Fast forward to late 2019.  I attended a Bitcoin Cash celebration in Vancouver and sat next to Amaury on the connecting flight.  It was at that time when he explained to me how the total SHA-256 pool would be forced to subsidize BCH.  I thought it was a clever idea, and important to help ABC get the infrastructure funding they needed. In 2020, I took it upon myself to try to help ABC in this way.  I contacted BTC.top, ViaBTC, and Antpool and presented our idea.


Is this the first time you disclose this? I've never heard it before and was sure that the miners came up with the IFP.

&gt;ABC’s version of the IFP (if you can even call it that) is so poor that the issues are surfacing even before it is released.  Take myself for example -- in the span of half a year, I went from being someone who Amaury wanted on his 2 of 3 multisig to a political enemy.  The project I maintain (Electron Cash) went from being “essential infrastructure” that was included in the first IFP to a project now demonized by an ABC supporter. The only discernible reason for this change of position is that I am now an IFP opponent rather than a suporter.  This is what happens when politics are invited into the protocol.

btcaccount91904,"I like the article, but I'm a little concerned that this is preaching to the choir. 

What we need to be doing right now is convincing exchanges, as they are the ones who have the ability to assign the ticker symbol (and therefore the coin identity of ""Bitcoin Cash"", in the eyes of the general public).

Your article lists exchanges as part of ""the community"", but I don't think that's the case generally. There certainly have been a few who also run miners and have commented by making statements about what they will mine, but there are also many that have not commented at all, including major ones like Coinbase, and others that have taken (dubiously) ""neutral"" positions. Many, despite listing BCH, may not consider themselves part of BCH's ""community"", and may not be interested in its politics.

I think those exchanges aren't looking for these kinds of arguments. It's a little too ""Here is why ABC's plan is bad"" and not enough ""The BCH community rejects ABC and its plan, and here is why you should listen to the community"". 

Many coins just simply have centralized development -- lead devs that implement whatever ideas they like, whether they make for ""sound money"" or not. Exchanges deal with these kinds of coins all the time. I don't think the exchanges particularly care whether these changes are bad for a coin. They just let the devs do what they want with ""their"" coin and leave it to the market to decide which coins are valuable. 

I think what we need is a short article that makes a compelling case to these exchanges for **why Bitcoin Cash should not be treated that way -- why it is important that Bitcoin Cash is not defined by a single dev team (ABC) or a single website (bitcoincash.org).** I fully expect that if we can get *at least* ""fair"" ticker treatment, BCH can reject IFP successfully -- almost no one wants the IFP. My last remaining concern at this point is whether or not the disinterested exchanges will give the non-ABC chain that treatment, and that's why I believe we need to be focusing in this direction.

For instance (just one idea) -- we could argue that Bitcoin Cash came about in 2017 because the rules of BTC could not be changed to accommodate a significant hard fork block size increase, and the BCH community has always seen Bitcoin Core's resistance to such a change as a large reason for this. That's why, ever since the earliest days of BCH, BCH has prioritized having multiple implementations, **specifically** to avoid a recurrence of that situation where one dev team gets the final say on consensus matters, and that is why there are six or so BCH node implementations available and why the majority of miners have already switched to a different one. The BCH community may have gone along with ABC in the past based on the merits of the individual decisions, but it was never the case that the community saw ABC as some kind of definer of the coin who gets the final say on **all** decisions, and therefore, to treat BCH as being owned and led by ABC (or defined by bitcoincash.org, which ABC controls) despite massive opposition from the ecosystem would go against the central principles of the coin's community.

(Maybe there are other, better arguments.)

Also, we need to clearly and concisely back up any claim of massive opposition to ABC. We could probably do that with a signed statement by everyone against ABC's Coinbase Rule, and more generally, against BCH being defined by the decisions of a single entity like ABC or Bitcoincash.org. We have a statement by those in favor of ASERT over Grasberg, but that is technically outdated now. We also have lots of individual statements, but nothing really nicely presented that unites them, I think. 

I think we should have a new statement, or at least an easy-to-parse table of all the major figures in the BCH ecosystem and who stands on which side, [like this one that was made for Segwit](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Segwit_support), so that the exchanges can clearly see at a glance where the ecosystem support is.

jberm123,"Arguments against Monero from a Bitcoin maximalist perspective:

Since bitcoin is public, we can be 100% certain the supply is correct, no one is double spending, no one is minting coin, etc. whereas with Monero, if the math turns out to have some unforeseen flaw or there’s some bug in the implementation, it would be more difficult (maybe even impossible) to tell and subsequently fix.

Thus, public is really what you want at the base layer of the protocol of a secure global currency. More of a feature than a bug.

And if you want privacy, move over to a bitcoin layer 2 solution.

Taking off my bitcoin maximalist hat, I don’t have a strong enough understanding of the privacy potential of bitcoin layer 2 solutions to further expand on the above argument.

Personally it seems pretty clear the better move would be to move over to Monero if privacy is your primary concern. For that reason, I personally think Monero is valuable.",g2ymn35,2020-08-27 07:40:36,9

puff_paff,"&gt; don’t you see?

all I see is people with questionable analytic skills spreading meme-analysis as truths. 

- a couple weeks ago the correlation boyz were hot and sweaty about SPX correlation; probably they all left and bought a boat with their profits exploiting this brilliant trading edge; they deserve it, finding two arbitrary charts and some pattern during some random timeframe is some real alpha.

- DXY is an index relative to other currencies (euro, yen, gbp). Dollar down, implies people fleeing to BTC as save investment, I have been told.... but wait? dxy down means euro up, so this means euro people are selling bitcoin for euros as a more save investment, right? uhm.... reductio ad absurdum, unless everything what is happening on international forex market can be explained by bitcoin switching hands across continents? This must be the only logical explanation since I started with crypto some years ago and really like it, ergo: everything happening in the world must also be about crypto.

- since most of us saw the inflation [shopping card](https://chrislo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Bitcoin-shopping-cart-inflation-deflation-protecting-federal-reserve.jpg) picture over at /r/bitcoin, we can call ourselves experts in macro-economics; inflation is not some very complicated long-term process, but is happening right now (this moment even when I am browsing reddit late at night); the charts are not bored people speculating but are a direct reflection of real world causes such as inflation: it's so really easy: we can see immediately how the dollar getting weaker means bitcoin is succeeding.

- lastly, clearly some wall street guys are taking advantage of this, any good story needs a bad guy; quants with PhDs are reading this subreddit (which is like 10-15 of the same people posting daily) to gauge market sentiment and will take advantage of this indubitable market correlation; they stopped trading other markets with thousand times more liquidity and opened bitmex accounts (and are shilling their reflinks to Nancy at the reception right now). These brilliant minds working at trading desks are making sure bitcoin remains synchronized with the rest of international markets, because why not? because: Bit Coin.

Capt_Roger_Murdock,"I guess it’s “survived” in the narrow sense, but I’m having a hard time feeling too optimistic right now.  Three years after BCH forked off for the purposes of lifting the 1-MB block size limit, the median block size of this ""big block"" chain is about... 100 kb. (The then-undivided Bitcoin chain began consistently exceeding that level back in late 2012.) And BCH is trading at a USD price the then-undivided Bitcoin chain first achieved back in 2013. And the price ratio to BTC is currently under 2.5%, an all-time low.

To quote Peter Rizun’s paraphrase of an analogy I shared with him:

&gt;I've also been feeling down about bitcoin since the hash war. Like /u/capt_roger_murdock said to me recently, between 2015 - 2017 bitcoin was a tree growing in a container too small for it to thrive. For over two years, we tried to move it to a larger pot without success. So we ended up taking a small cutting from the bitcoin tree and planting it in a much bigger pot. The little cutting admittedly looked kind of stupid in such a big pot, but with some watering and fertilizer we told ourselves that it would grow to fill that large container and more. But then just when the cutting was starting to establish some roots and to bud with new leaves, we decided to cut it in half, move each half to even bigger pots, and then trample and pee on both.

Being forced to fork off BTC as a rebranded minority chain did serious damage to BCH’s network effect, but with time I think it could have recovered. But then the messy BSV split did even more damage. And then ABC’s disastrous leadership and IFP fuckery did even more. I’m still *hopeful* that the bitcoin peer-to-peer electronic cash project that filled me with so much excitement back in 2012 will find a way to succeed. But “optimistic”? That would probably be a stretch.",g2z6hn6,2020-08-27 10:36:49,8

mkgll,"I think some people in Bitcoin Cash may have taken the wrong lesson from Core. 

They see in their reluctance to hard-fork to raise the block size a lesson that ""resistance to change is bad,"" and have concluded that the opposite is good.

I think that's wrong. If Core were resistant to change, they would not have made a highly radical change by refusing to raise the block size.

Scaling was always part of the ""instrinsic promise"" of Bitcoin, and IMO refusing to scale is as egregious a violation of that promise as changing the block reward.

The lesson is in fact that Core was far too willing to change the basic promise behind Bitcoin.

fishsupreme,"40 billion hashes per second may be reasonable depending on the hash algorithm used.

At one extreme, say it's SHA256. In that case, $100 will buy you a used Antminer S9 ASIC hashing rig, which can try 14 *trillion* hashes per second. It won't take an hour, it'll take 17 seconds. Obviously this isn't a ""standard computer,"" but it only cost $100.

However, you can only buy dirt-cheap used ASIC hashing rigs for hashes that are used in popular cryptocurrency mining. (I use the S9 as an example because it is no longer profitable to mine Bitcoin with one, so they are now worthless for that purpose and available at fire-sale prices.)

Say it's something else and you can't use ASICs. $5,000 will put together a system with 4 modern GPUs (say nVidia GTX 2070s.) Your speed then could be over 100 billion hashes/sec on MD5 or SHA-1, maybe 85 billion hashes/sec on SHA-256, or 60 billion hashes/sec on SHA-512.

You do need GPUs, though. CPUs are awful at this category of problems (known whimsically in computer science as ""[embarrassingly parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel) problems."") You might get 50-100 million hashes per second on a very high-end Intel or AMD CPU, like a thousandth of what comparably-priced GPU would generate.

However, keep in mind these are all standard hash algorithms, not purpose-designed password hashes like bcrypt or PBKDF2. Cracking those is *enormously* slower, many orders of magnitude. For instance, that same $5,000 GPU cracking rig might manage 60 thousand hashes per second on bcrypt. Not billion, *thousand*.",g33tyhr,2020-08-28 14:20:21,8

Here is my general opinion about btc's price action in next 2-3 years

* first point, there will be no parabola like late 2017, where btc price went 4x in about 4 months. 4x price action in such short range, will not happen, Because there are many exchanges like bakkt and cme, which allow shorting of btc. Which means that price action will not be drastic.
* the upward movement in price will continue for next 2-3 yeras, and beyond. Overall, I expect it to be at 18k at EOY, and at about 25k-40k at end of 2021.
* The price rise is happening due to demand from gbtc ( normal 401-k holders), and demand from recent buyer like microstrategy , which is a mnc that bought staggering 22k btc. That 22k btc, btw, took price from 9k to 11k. So here you can see demand directly taking price higher. I keep a tight watch on gbtc, and its accumulating btc at a drastic pace, spurred by demand from normal fellows mostly who are buying it for their 401-k. On top of that, get this, gbtc has **no redemption program**. Which means it only buys btc, ( and sells it only for fees if any).
* And now Fidelity is coming with its own Bitcoin Fund ( and only Bitcoin). That shows the demand for Bitcoin from the investors at large.
* Governments have already realized they cannot stop btc. Trump had told Mnuchin in 2018 to ""go after btc'. But mnuchin could not do anything, because there is not much he can do. So on that front, bitcoin has proven ( to the extent) its strength as decentralized network which can't be brought down easily be governments. That's why microstrategy bought it too - they aren't fools to put so much money in something Mnuchin could bring down overnight by a decree. So there will be no such decree.
* Another bullish point is ABSOLUTE lack of any alternative to btc. The top 10, apart from btc, is a shitshow. XRP is an out and out scam. and even others are totally no shots and scams. So Bitcoin is the only thing in this market.
* I think anyone who buys btc today, and holds for next 10 years, can get returns of about 10x-15x. And the thing is, the risk is very low, so I strongly recommend people to buy at least 10-20% of their portfolio in btc. This is for EVERYONE.

darkwaterosint,"Everyone has to make decisions about how comfortable they are with a SWAT team kicking down their door at 4:30 am, siezing their hardware and arresting them for importing drugs. The problem with good OPSEC is that it is inconvenient. It requires restricting access to listings, it requires Monero, it requires multi-sig. 

A flashy user interface, easy transactions, simple transaction completion all seem amazing in theory, and provide a better vendor and buyer experience (and we explain why here: www.darkwaterosint.wordpress.com), but they are inherently insecure. Any market accepting bitcoin, is open to LE involvement. 

We scraped 60+ buyers from Silk Road 1 market just by using their clearnet published Bitcoin addresses and ties to known and published Silk Road escrow accounts. We got names, and e-mail addresses tied to Facebook accounts for donations, or posts asking for contributions on the clearnet, etc. It took about 3 minutes. 

It sure would suck if LE has that same information and some poor individuals got arrested 13 years after the fact (disclaimer: its happened dozens of times, because the blockchain is eternal). 

When selecting a market your personal safety has to be your top priority. The flashy, new, untested markets, with Empire like bitcoin set ups are of course easier to use than White House. But they are also the kinds of markets that mean you'll be worrying about being vanned decades after the fact. 

We are in no way endorsing WHM or any other market, but rather pointing out that selecting a platform that you are using to commit a crime should be based on your personal safety only. Ease of use should not enter your head, because the less complex it is for you, the less complex it is for anyone who wants to find you also.

The big thing to do is to research the exchange you are going to use before you fund your account. Check forums to make sure they aren't having problems with people withdrawing money. Make sure they have reasonable fees. But watch out if their prices are TOO good. Scam exchanges will offer great prices to sell your bitcoin, and people will use them without researching because it looks like such a great deal.

And just because an exchange was legit 1 year ago doesn't mean they are ok to use today. So even if you used them previously, check up on them again before sending money.

Excellent question, Bitcoin is one of the most important open source projects in existence and need to work in solidarity to improve it and society as a whole. Your design background might help with the documentation that could use more images and diagrams or helping test UX issues in wallets and services. 

If you aren't a developer than here are ways to contribute.


1) Educate yourself more-
https://lopp.net/bitcoin.html

2) Run an economic full node - https://btcinformation.org/en/wallets/desktop/windows/bitcoincore/

3) Possibly mine with an ASIC after doing 100 hours of research - 
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=14.0

4) Perform translations-

https://github.com/achow101/btcinformation.org

https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoincore.org


5) write documentation 

https://github.com/achow101/btcinformation.org

https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoincore.org

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page

http://lopp.net/bitcoin.html

https://github.com/jlopp/lopp.net/blob/master/bitcoin.html

6) Start a blog , or write articles on medium about bitcoin. 

7) Participate more on social media websites and forums educating others 

8) Attend local meetups and discuss Bitcoin IRL

9) Sell Bitcoin locally

10) manage a bitcoin atm 

11) Set various buy limit orders (In addition to buying Bitcoin at regular intervals)  on an exchange you use with deposited fiat. This will decrease Bitcoin's volatility by increasing buy limit support which is critical to both investor confidence and Bitcoin maturing into a stable currency and a less volatile unit of account. The side benefit is you can auto pickup any dips and save money.

12) Help answer new user questions on r/BitcoinBeginners

13) Invest in more Bitcoin , but focus on spending and replacing as well to support local businesses that accept Bitcoin. 

14) Help local Merchants accept Bitcoin

13) Help test open source bitcoin software by reporting any bugs you find to the developers. Most projects have a github page which has an issue tracker.

14) Donate to open source bitcoin projects and other bitcoin-related volunteer efforts.

15) Provide liquidity in joinmarket

16) Provide liquidity on Bisq

17) Buy Bitcoin and securely store it

18) Spend money (BTC) with merchants that accept Bitcoin and replace the spent BTC. Better yet , go to a bar or restaurant that accepts Bitcoin with friends and family and pay the bill with Bitcoin in front of them to show them how easy it is.",g3ag5p6,2020-08-30 07:04:56,3

Zeyode,"&gt;Can I start a small business?

You can, but only a co-op if you wanna avoid hypocrisy. The main point of anarchism is to abolish as much hierarchy as possible, which the traditional business (big or small) relies on. A power imbalance where owners have power over workers. Worker co-ops solve this power imbalance by bringing democracy to the workplace, and giving workers collective ownership of the places they work at, effectively ridding the business of any distinction between worker and owner. An economy mainly comprised of co-ops would be called market socialist, or market anarchist (depending on whether or not the hierarchy of the state is yeeted at this point). The way I see it, small businesses are better than big ones, but at the end of the day, it's the same thing on a smaller scale.

&gt;Should I be donating to the needy?

It's good praxis to help the needy however you can, but you don't have to. Everyone has their own living expenses, so it would be unreasonable to expect everyone to just donate all the time.

&gt;Can I work in finance?

If/when we abolish the commodity form, the job would be rendered redundant. However, I don't think that we'd be able to abolish the market economy in our lifetimes, so you'd be safe if you did. Even co-ops need people managing finances. It's not unheard of for people to go for econ degrees for this exact purpose.

&gt;Can I trade stocks for a living?

This however, wouldn't really make sense even in a market anarchist society. Co-ops and stocks don't mix. Stocks are a measurement of ownership of a company that can be consolidated, giving the people who own more stocks disproportionate power over the workers. Stock trading doesn't make sense if you also wanna abolish that hierarchy. Might be okay for making money in the short term. Just not long term.

&gt;What are your thoughts on Bitcoin?

I'm neutral on it. I want currency to eventually be abolished, but in the meantime, it's fine. At best, it's useful if you need to buy something under the table for whatever reason. At worst, it was annoying for a while when bitcoin miners bumped up the price of GPUs. Been thinking of getting some for a rainy day, but idk where to begin.

ShadowOfHarbringer,"Hello, well known Shill.

Regarding your point:

&gt; Don't let these scammers around here tell you to buy bitcoin cash.

Why would he buy Bitcoin for? If for actually *using* it, it would be pointless to buy Bitcoin BTC as it cannot be *used*, because it is too prohibitively expensive, cumbersome, slow and faulty for any Joe Sixpack.

The only thing that can be done with BTC is speculate and sell it on an exchange, which is not really *using*, nor what is and was the *point* of the invention of Bitcoin in the first place (it was supposed to be a currency, as in something you can *use* to *buy* goods and services).

But the problem with exchanges is, they do not hold your Bitcoin. Bitcoin held at an exchange is not Bitcoin, it is a promise of Bitcoin. Avoiding of which situation *was* *exactly* the reason for inventing Bitcoin in the first place.

So logically in this situation, what we do here is point newbies to a Bitcoin that they can **use** and actually *works*. Meaning: **Bitcoin Cash**, BCH.

It's just that nothing else even makes any sense.

Being ASIC resistant just means more that everyone can do it at a worthwhile pace, as long as no massive entity sets up said warehouse, or mines on a botnet on a few million cloud servers, phones, or IoT things.

Bitcoin = makes it impossible to centrally regulate shit

When this modern world wide ""Petro-dollar socialism"" falls apart and The Dollar dies.... Bitcoin will take a big part of the money market (along side gold and silver).  
And Bitcoin makes Agorism so fucking easy... and it makes Taxation extremely hard...

Central planers will have only 2 options: let people be free... or double down on tyranny just to be able to tax people like they used to. Like full on Owrellian surveillance just to keep tabs on peoples spending.  
So some countries will go a lot more Libertarian, and some will go full Commie.

Libertarian countries will be a lot more successful and in the long run people copy successful systems even if they don't understand them.

I can see the world in 100-200 years without socialism and Bitcoin will facilitate the transition.

Some thing I can predict for sure like:  
\- the dollar will die  
\- bitcoin will take a part of the money market  
\- bitcoin makes taxation extremely difficult  
\- statists will have to double down on tyranny in some/most countries  
\- some countries will go Libertarian   
\- people imitate stuff that works  
and it's enough to see the death of Socialism

It's the early days. And the same way you couldn't imagine smartphones in 1991 when the internet was starting I can't even begin to imagine how AWESOME Crypto will become.

But the sky is the limit if you remember Hayek's knowledge problem.  
When Bitcoin goes mainstream. It will be the first time in the history of the planet that ALL 8 billion people will be connected in the same free market. (there is about 2B people today that don't have access to banking at all and a lot more are underbanked)

This means that the internet and BTC will for the first time in the history connect the Knowledge (thru prices) of 8 billion people in one GIANT FREE-MARKET BRAIN .

https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/18/mueller-clinton-arizona-hack/

&gt;“I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” said then-candidate Trump at a press conference, referring to emails Clinton stored on a personal email server while she headed the State Department. Mueller’s report said “within approximately five hours” of those remarks, GRU officers began targeting for the first time Clinton’s personal office.

&gt;More than a dozen staffers were targeted by Unit 26165, including a senior aide. **“It is unclear how the GRU was able to identify these email accounts, which were not public,”** said Mueller.

&gt;Mueller said the Trump campaign made efforts to “find the deleted Clinton emails.” Trump is said to have privately asked would-be national security advisor Michael Flynn, since convicted following inquiries by the Special Counsel’s office, to reach out to associates to obtain the emails. **One of those associates was Peter Smith, who died by suicide in May 2017,** who claimed to be in contact with Russian hackers — claims which Mueller said were not true.

https://slate.com/technology/2018/07/cryptocurrency-helped-russian-operatives-hack-the-dnc-in-2016.html

&gt;In an attempt to further conceal their identities, the intelligence officers created hundreds of different email accounts to make the purchases, converted funds into different cryptocurrencies, and acquired bitcoin through peer-to-peer exchanges. **Investigators found that the same computers that were facilitating the bitcoin transactions were also used to create and send test spearfishing emails.**

https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/13/russian-hackers-used-bitcoin-to-fund-election-interference-so-prepare-for-fud/

&gt;But the process of laundering, after all, becomes rather difficult when there is an immutable, peer-maintained record of every penny being pushed around. Small slip-ups in the team’s operational security allowed investigators to tie, for example, an email address used to access a given bitcoin wallet with the one used to pay for a VPN.

&gt;**""[U]sing funds in a bitcoin address, the Conspirators purchased a VPN account, which they later used to log into the @Guccifer_2 Twitter account. The remaining funds from that bitcoin address were then used […] to lease a Malaysian server that hosted the dcleaks.com website.""**

&gt;It’s likely that the very same distributed ledger technology that allows for anonymous international payments in the first place also creates an invaluable investigative tool for those savvy enough to take advantage of it. So although bitcoin has its shady side, it’s far from perfect secrecy, especially when exposed to the privileges of a federal investigative team.

ARRRBEEE,"Alright now that the initial ""shock"" has subsided a little bit re: the BitMEX news, I've had a moment to gather my thoughts. Here they are:

* This is a *big* deal (indicted for Bank Secrecy Act shit in NY state is a yikes), and has the potential to snowball into a ***really big*** deal, but it will take time to sort out in court. Thankfully for BitMEX's founders they're all legit billionaires, so they will have the best legal defense money can buy. Literally. They'll certainly need it because of hilariously flagrant shit like this:

&gt; One defendant went as far as to brag the company incorporated in a jurisdiction outside the U.S. because bribing regulators in that jurisdiction cost just ‘a coconut'

* IANAL but the long-term most-likely outcome is that BitMEX simply settles and pays a [massive] fine (CFTC shakedown as another Reddit calls out below). As many have astutely pointed out below, BitMEX's exchange product doesn't touch fiat currency so there's a valid case to be made in their favor. Since CFTC has no jurisdiction over a business registered in Seychelles (or Bermuda), the exchange will continue to exist (albeit with strict KYC/AML procedures).
* There is a **BLACK-SWAN** possibility that a separate 3-letter US law enforcement agency seizes the BitMEX.com domain. This *might* occur if BitMEX refuses to settle with the CFTC and/or another agency is somehow emboldened to take action. This is probably very bad.
* If you're not a trader, but have a long-term bullish bias on Bitcoin--nothing really changes. This doesn't change the value proposition of Bitcoin as an asset. It *might* change the short-/mid- term supply/demand mechanics (resulting in low spot prices), but that still remains to be seen. DCA, buy the dips, whatever. You're chillin'.

Things I'm looking out for &amp; how I plan on trading this:

* 2 out of the 3 BitMEX founders need to be physically present to approve withdrawals from cold storage. ([Source](https://blog.bitmex.com/bitmex-security/)) These guys will be out free on-bail same-day, but in the unlikely scenario where 2 out of 3 are in jail, then withdrawals will be temporarily suspended. This may induce panic in the market (although ironically, if you can't withdraw physical coins, then you can't sell sooo... bullish? /s)
* Keep a sharp eye on BitMEX open interest. Traders on the platform are now faced with two risk vectors: price AND counterparty. Logically, if you want to hedge *price* risk you can do 1 of 2 things: 1) withdraw and sell your coins spot **OR** 2) short synthetic swap/futures. If you you want to hedge counterparty risk, you simply withdraw--but first you must close out your position(s). If open interest falls dramatically along with the price, then that tells me traders are closing out longs (and possibly exiting the platform). There's not a whole lot of leverage left in the system though. (Mex OI is roughly 1/2 of what it was in February and we're at the same price)
* Pay attention to the spot market volumes &amp; CME/Bakkt. I used to shit on them, but Bakkt has quietly become a noteworthy force in the game. They're consistently doing at-or-above the same volume as Coinbase on the BTC-USD pair on their physically-settled daily futures product. CME volume was very low at the end of the last quarter and open interest is at-or-below summer levels. The biggest institutions don't give a shit about BitMEX so if they're thinking macro, the narrative that PJT espoused for example, still seems very valid.
* Despite all this FUD, we're holding the 50D EMA ($10,490ish on Coinbase/Stamp). No real need to panic--well within the chop zone. Daily close below $10K and we're probably fucked.

New Zealand: https://nz.easycrypto.ai/blog/inland-revenue-info-request-to-nz-crypto-companies-sept-2020/

**This is not an exhaustive list.** Other countries will be doing the same and if you haven’t paid taxes yet I suggest you do some research into what the laws are and if your government is auditing cryptocurrency buyers and traders. If you pay taxes now, you will avoid bigger fines which are given for not disclosing your gains in crypto.

**How do I know if I need to pay taxes?**

It is fair to assume that if you have made any crypto trade where the value of your crypto when making this trade is greater than when you bought your crypto then you should be researching what your tax obligations are. A trade includes crypto to crypto trades such as selling BTC for ETH in most countries (it doesn’t have to be back into US Dollars or your local currency). For example, if you bought 1 BTC for $5,000 and traded that 1 BTC for ETH when BTC was worth $10,000, then you have made $5,000 in taxable income in most tax jurisdictions. However, this is not the case in all countries, so you should research your local laws to see if this applies to you.

Anyway, I hate to even discuss this because I think that most crypto tax laws are unfair and outdated but that doesn’t change the fact that at some point you will have to pay them. Ultimately, I would rather pay them now rather than have to pay them later with extra fines and fees for not paying them on time.",g7djypp,2020-10-02 15:30:41,12

Limburg3rt,"KYC, AML, regulations, at least bitcoin doesn't give a fuck and keeps on producing blocks. I'm just so pissed by the double standards. I am from the Netherlands and as we speak small crypto firms are moving out of the country because they have to put down thousands of dollars and apply for a lot of bullshit, which is almost impossible for a lot of small innovative start ups. The regulator who comes with these rules is the Dutch National Bank ( De Nederlandse Bank). Who on earth would make a bank the regulator of crypto firms?

So for me it's all a bit of the same bs. Now it's Bitmex, which one is next? 

Please explain why they react here, and not with banks laundering 2Trillion USD for almost 2 decades?

Please explain why at least since 2008 not a single banker was trialed, convicted or went to jail?

All the fraud (the list and fines are endless) and when they screw up, the taxpayer picks up the tab.

So yeah, fuck all regulators, KYC and AML is a pile of horseshit. Makes us jump through hoops when we want to buy a couple of hundred dollar bitcoin, but if you show up at a bank as a cartel boss, dictator or terrorist and you bring millions you get VIP treatment and they succeed in laundering the money for them for years in a row. Not a single regulator or KYC or AML rule prevented that.

Super_Govedo,"Illegal IPTV in a hotel is not a good thing to do.

Before any smarta** tries to say there are legal providers too, yeah there are but they won't give you m3u file of link, m3u file/link providers are illegal and always will be. M3u file was before used for other purposes but today it's well accepted file format that's mainly used for watching IPTV. Idk is there even any other format than m3u.

But legal providers have their own apps with hard coded streaming links and when you pay legal providers you pay them PER month and you have invoices you pay AS company (hotel company) and not privately via PayPal or Bitcoin....

So OP, be careful, there is just no way someone today or in far future won't report you for offering illegal IPTV channels. You could have unsatisfied customer who will go to police and simply say ""Hey that hotel has illegal TV provider"" despite customer had problem with something else, and you will be screwed completely.

But, you do what you want. Illegal IPTV is something you get for yourself, your friend or family member and not publicly to 100+ mad people.

All I will say is that one person offering cheap IPTV got fined with 400.000€ for doing that. Imagine what can happen for doing same in public space in a hotel.",g7ggwg0,2020-10-03 07:33:12,4

btc_clueless,"Vitalik made some interesting and detailed comments about his vision of the Ethereum roadmap. For those not following ETH development closely there might be some surprises. He says the network in its current state is almost unusable for many apps. No surprise there. Many people pin their hopes (incl. hope for a price pump) on ETH 2.0. While phase 0 should go online later this year, the early phases are just about the implementation of PoS etc. But the phases that increase transactions per second (via sharding) won't be implemented for several years (!) according to Vitalik. So network congestion will be an unsolved problem for the foreseeable future. He suggests there should be a strong push towards second layer solutions, ZK rollups and better solutions to bridge sidechains now. If the majority of projects built on Ethereum would do that, it would practically solve the scaling problem even without having to wait for sharding and ETH 2.0 to be complete, according to him. 

Now, I don't know how practical or difficult such implementations are and how long this may take. But my takeaway message was that no, we won't see ETH 2.0 completed sometime next year and solve all the problems. High gas fees and congestion might plague ETH for quite a while. Sidechains will become more and more important over time. I didn't see him mention mention POA networks like the xDAI chain, but I assume that things like xDAI might become way more relevant (and with better interoperability with the main layer, hopefully also simpler to use), so we might use things like honeyswap a lot more in the future. 

I just hope that the network issues won't hurt ETH's price action in the upcoming bullmarket. On the other hand, Bitcoin has similar scaling issues and people still buy it. As a famous man once said ""It is what it is. We'll see what happens...""

pm_interesting_fact,"&gt; the phases that increase transactions per second (via sharding) won't be implemented for several years (!) according to Vitalik. 

*Ooooofffff* guess I'm even more bullish on polkadot now. 

&gt; Now, I don't know how practical or difficult such implementations are

From my perspective it's a step back in regards to user-friendly access and adoption, especially when it comes to new users. 

In a world where only eth exists as a platform we could figure it out. We're used to having seperated log-in's for every site we visit so if every dApp had a level 2 layer that be like having our metamask being the equivalent of the app drawer off our phone. 
We could make it work but we don't have to put all our eggs in one basket. Case and point; MySpace, perfectly viable platform but who still uses it? We found something better *kuch* and moved on. 

&gt; On the other hand, Bitcoin has similar scaling issues and people still buy it.

Bitcoin is digital gold, a store of value. The value proposition of eth is different. 
I'm not saying it's going to zero but if implementing sharding is gonna take years it's safe to say eth is going to loose it's second place on the charts.

SpockSays,"With long term swing trades, yes.

For newbies interested in getting involved, I wouldn't recommend to do anything aside from accumulating bitcoin by dollar cost averaging. (for example buy $10 a week, or however much $$$ up to you, regardless of the spot price, and do that at least 6 months). At that point you will have a better idea how market movements work and hopefully learn more about the tech as you become more involved... and you should have made some gains in the process.

Short term trading is just gambling.

Trading with leverage is gambling.

99% of altcoins aside from bitcoin are scams/gambling.

Watching/understanding the market is an almost full-time obsession for me.

crypto_grandma,"My 'aha' Bitcoin moment came about a year after I'd been investing in it. I had been living and working abroad for several years and as I was to be leaving the country shortly I wanted to send the money I had saved (a relatively small amount) from my foreign bank to my home country bank. The bank said they'd need my work permit for this, but as I'd left my job 6 months previously and had been staying as a tourist during that time I no longer had a work permit. The bank said I wouldn't be able to make the international money transfer without the work permit. 

That's when I realized that 'my' money *belonged* to the bank. I was already signed up to a crypto exchange in that country so decided if I couldn't send it to my home bank I'd purchase Bitcoin with it instead. At least then I'd be in control of it. 

Before that day, Bitcoin was just some magic internet money I'd gambled on hoping the price would go up. Ever since then, I see just how important it is. I find it liberating owning Bitcoin",g7jjjvl,2020-10-04 04:17:20,4

Blockstream and Bitfinex Tether have turned Bitcoin into a speculative ponzi scheme. When their lies and manipulation inevitably cause them to implode and collapse, it's going to create irreparable harm in confidence to cryptocurrency and use as p2p electronic cash. Bitcoin would have changed the world if Blockstream didn't steal it so they could try to profit off it.

that's childsplay. the viruses of old were created by much less skilled hackers that didn't even have the source code of your operating system but now microsoft's spaghetti code is out in the open everybody can see it and your computer is more screwed then an unchaperoned toddler on epstein's island dring a bill clinton visit your kernel is going down faster then a golden retriever at the atf's headquarters. now before you go into full panic mode and start freaking out there are some solutions for you to continue using your computer, my personal recommendation is to load up dban, completely remove any trace of windows, or any other proprietary bullshit operating system that came with your computer, and then install gentoo and use that for the rest of eternity to do your computing. if you can't figure out how to use gentoo then you have the option of using linux mint which is another approved gnu/linux operating system that is more noob friendly and kind of similar to windows in the layout just minus all the horrible bullcrap and spaghetti code that makes up windows. if you can't figure out how to use linux mint then you should just sell your computer, purchase a horse and buggy, and go be amish in a field somewhere because it's no longer safe for you to have a computer or really any electronic device for that matter. hopefully the many years of you beating off to cam girls will translate into good butter churning skills so you can earn a living as an amish person. if you fail to comply you are going to get updates forcefully pushed to your operating system which has been happening for a while now because let's face it, microsoft has never even heard of the word consent, but instead of these updates coming from microsoft themself, bill gates himself, they are going to be coming from the hacker known as 4chan and you will soon experience strange behavior in your operating system, internet explorer or microsoft edge or whatever the hell they're calling that crap these days will be replaced with pale moon or a similar furry browser. every day the wallpaper on your desktop is going to become an anime girl that is more and more lewd and vaguely underage as time goes on all of your home videos will be replaced by forceful tentacle hentai, all of your family photos are going to be replaced with pepes that become more and more racist as time goes on, oh and also your webcam will permanently live stream to liveleak so watch out for chinese truck drivers and off-duty brazzilian police officers. now i don't want to hear any of you wondering all of a sudden oh woe is me why does something like this have to happen to me no you've been warned for years and years about the dangers of proprietary software and yet you did nothing, richard stallman went out of his way to make speeches at college campuses all across the world even doing some in spanish so that he can reach a wider audience and going days without a proper meal this man had to subsist on nutrients from the bottom of his foot and yet you did nothing, edward snowden revealed that bioluminescent goverment agents were living in your computer watching you watch cam girls and browse old memes that washed up on the shores of reddit all under the guise of stopping terrorism and had to flee the united states and go live in a russian airport bathroom and yet you continued using windows purchasing a new copy every few years making bill gates a gorillianare in the process so that he could get ot his end goal of injecting windows updates directly into the bloodstream of every person in the world and newborn babies and yet you kept on using windows even though each new version removed more and more of your rights and became more and more bloated but now 4chan, the hacker, has taken it to the extreme. you will no longer be using your operating system it will se you, it will require a minimum of 2 terabytes of ram and a quantum cpu just to load up the crypto miner that's going to be required to boot your operating system. now alternatively i have heard directly from the hacker known as 4chan that for one bitcoin you can purchase a subscription of windows xp yotsuba edition which will have most of the restrictions removed however your wallpaper will still be set to a lewd vaguely underage anime girl and your browser will be permanently set to [4channel.org](https://4channel.org), uh, also microsoft word is going to be replaced with vim so good luck doing your homework on there hopefully you know how to quit out of it. you have been warned now go install gentoo or suffer the consequences or like i said sell all your electronics and go be amish because the amish don't get computer viruses",g7k6ho8,2020-10-04 06:28:53,4

Yes, you should, because when you own Bitcoin you OWN your money, no one can freeze it, control it, stop you from spending.

\--That's pretty neat. I think ill just hold $18k USD for now.

2020:

\--So, you still have bitcoin, and you still own your money right?

Well, not exactly. I can only get $10k now, Bitcoin decided to freeze my $8k funds until Bitcoin decides the price should go back to $18k, in which ill finally get my $8k back. But the scary thing is, Bitcoin can also keep freezing my funds like the last time they did, they only allowed me to withdrawal $3k a couple years ago. But Bitcoin decided to go up and unlock my funds slowly.

In the last 4 years alone...

Bitcoin ABC has conflicts with BU.

Bitcoin ABC has conflicts with Bitcoin.com

Bitcoin ABC has conflicts with former BCH community (now BSV)

Bitcoin ABC has conflicts with BCHN.

Bitcoin ABC has conflicts with Jonathan Toomin on the DAA.

Bitcoin ABC has conflicts with some of the current BCH builders and supporters.

Bitcoin ABC has conflicts with big investors like Justin Bons Cyber Capital.

Bitcoin ABC has conflicts with someone who donated money to them in the past (eg. Marc De Mesel).

Let's call the IFP for what it is, if a person is willing to sabotage or cause harm to you when you don't give him money, that is an extortion attempt.

Despite all that, I'm happy to tell you that the most likely outcome in November is that Bitcoin Cash will upgrade normally as it does, except the saboteur can no longer stall the progress of others nor prevent others from scaling Bitcoin Cash anymore.

There are overwhelming evidence that the businesses do not support ABC's extortion attempt.

There are overwhelming evidence that the community does not support ABC's extortion attempt.

There are overwhelming evidence that the miners do not support ABC's extortion attempt.

EtherSecAgent,"This should be a concern for everyone honestly, I know Alex is a great guy and is serious about security but mistakes can happen. 


I think it's probably best to hold more centralized crypto assets with Celsius, for example Tether, USDC , or the Cel Token itself.

Since these are more centralized if they are notified / become aware of a hack quickly enough they would most likely revert / freeze the funds etc. 

For ether or bitcoin, that's gonna have to be covered by insurance or from Cel Assets.

&gt; There is a 4% fee to purchase bitcoin with cash ***with a spread as well*** ^(1).

[source](https://coinme.com/faq/)

You can (and should) always calculate the spread by comparing the price at the ATM to the ""market price"".  The market price can be found by simply googling ""bitcoin price"".

For example, at the time of this post, the ""googled"" price was $10525.  I'd be willing to bet if you went to the coinstar to BUY, the price would be $11578 and if you went back to SELL the price would be $9473.

Wormholes, string theory, quantum mechanics, they seem like absolute Magic to the layman. They certainly couldn't discuss the intimate details of string theory with their old high school buddies.

Money shouldn't be as hard to understand as string theory, but very sadly it is because our educational system has hid the basics of money from just about everyone. Worse, it has actively taught very wrong ideas about how the economy works (Keynesian econ, socialism) and what money itself is.

igadjeed,"&gt; Was there an additional fee over the 4%?

Yes, Coinme adds 10% to the exchange rate without disclosing it as a fee  
Or, they do disclose it, because they inform the buyer of the purchase amount, during the transaction, at the machine  
As with all Bitcoin ATMs, the buyer is responsible for comparing the machine's price with currently reported exchange rates  

This is a common misconception for first-time buyers, that they're buying ""130 dollars of Bitcoin"" instead of seeing that the ATM is selling 0.01 Bitcoin for 130 dollars  

Every ATM customer has a phone. Every phone has Internet access. Every phone has a calculator app. See that coinmarketcap quotes 10581. Divide 130 by 0.01, result 13000. Divide 13000 by 10581, result 1.23, therefore 23% markup",g7miamr,2020-10-04 14:35:08,3

I_Like_To_Bike,"So a friend came to me asking for some advice. He mined a bit of Bitcoin back in the day in his high school years. I helped him recently learn about taxes and everything as he is starting his first job at a consulting firm.

With regard to the crypto, he’s now thinking about selling it and cashing out to start actually saving for retirement and whatnot.

According to his current income, he is in the 15% long term bracket. As far as I can tell, he owes long term gains on the difference between the value on the day it was mined and the value the day it was sold. Don’t think the irs will chase him down for the mined cost basis as it was so long ago and worth so little.

Question, does selling the crypto now move him up into the next long term capital gains bracket? Or are the proceeds from the sale not counted as income? If so, I feel like I should recommend he split up the sale over 2020 and 2021 to avoid bumping up into the next income /cap gains tax bracket.

Along similar lines, does income from selling crypto bump you up into the ineligible category for Roth IRA where you need to do backdoor Roth?

So the Lira would also be then, at an all time low against the USD in addition to bitcoin?

When you figure that the top 5 have little change against each other, they then become the world bank that all smaller currencies are traded against. So to say that Brazil is at an ATL against Bitcoin, does little if Brazil is also at an ATL against the GBP/USD?

MysteriousOnion3,"&gt; It’s so funny how you pretend Jews aren’t in constant danger here.

The ADL (Anti-Defamation League) supposedly exists in order to fight ""anti-semitism"".

The problem is that there's so little **real** anti-semitism that they have to manufacture it with fake hate crime hoaxes.

A few years ago, there was a wave of hate crime hoaxes against American Jewish centers.

Over 1,000 anti-Jewish threat phone calls were made. Bomb threats and other types of threats.

[JCC Threat-Makers: 2 Years, 1,000 Calls](https://www.timesofisrael.com/jcc-bomb-threat-suspect-reportedly-behind-over-1000-calls/)

Turns out that 2 Israeli Jews were paid in bitcoin to create this wave of hate crime hoaxes.

[JCC Threat-Makers “Paid with Bitcoin”](http://newobserveronline.com/jew-jcc-threat-makers-paid-bitcoin/)

No law enforcement has determined who paid them. But who benefited?

A very likely suspect is the ADL (Anti-Defamation League).

This wave of over 1,000 hate crime hoaxes was used by the ADL to raise huge amounts of money.

The ADL also used it as a pretext to pressure Amazon to ban a bunch of books on Holocaust Revisionism.

source:

https://codoh.com/library/document/5330/

When the Israeli Jews were caught, the ADL blamed the bomb threats on ""white hate"" rather than a Jewish hate crime hoax.

[ADL: Israeli Jew’s Bomb Threats against American Jews are “White Hate”](http://newobserveronline.com/adl-counts-jews-162-bomb-threats-against-jews-as-white-hate-crime/)

So that's the current world. There's so little **real** anti-Jewish hatred that the Jewish Supremacists have to manufacture it with fake ""anti-semitic"" hate crime hoaxes.

But what about the reverse? What's the state of Jewish hatred against whites?

Here's an American rabbi preaching that God has given Jews a mission to ""fix the world"". But what happens to people who don't want their country to be ""fixed"" by Jews? Exterminate! Every man, woman, child, and even the babies must be genocided.

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/dtx7zi/exterminate_an_american_rabbi_says_god_had_given/f6z9jbl?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x

This rabbi specifically states that the countries that must be genocided are America and most of europe (white majority countries)

Of course, these Jewish Supremacists pays no penalty for promoting genocide of white majority countries. Why not?

You aren't allowed to discuss or protest when Jewish Supremacists express genocidal hatred of white gentiles (non-Jews).

It's one of the many signs that we live under an [SJS - System of Jewish Supremacy](https://archive.fo/5cAQ3)

But most people don't know this, because the concept of [""White Supremacy"" is used as camouflage to cover up the fact that we actually live in a System of Jewish Supremacy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/d4al5e/why_do_universities_push_the_myth_that_black/f0alnsj/?context=3)

LaxInTheBrownies,"Answer:  Seems like most of these answers are jokes, so I'll attempt a serious one. WSB goes private from time to time and typically never announces why. Sometimes it might just be the mods screwing around with people, sometimes it'll be for a reason no one understands. 

A decent amount of the time, it could be for an SEC investigation into market manipulation or something similar. For anyone who doesn't know, the SEC (Securities Exchange Commission) monitors the stock market and tries to create a fair trading environment. Here's a [link](https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answerstmanipulhtm.html) to their website explaining market manipulation.

Basically, WSB is a good place to attempt market manipulation because everything is anonymous and a lot of people read it. One way you could attempt market manipulation is to post that you're an insider and you have secret information that hasn't been released about the company. If you convince enough people this is true and they buy your position, it will make your position worth more and then you can sell for a profit, while all the others are stuck with a bad investment.

Another way would be to get a large group of users to agree to buy a small stock at the same time. This would raise the value, get the attention of other investors, and get more people to buy in (think bitcoin in 2018 on a much smaller scale). Then the group sells early, before the artificial bubble pops.

There's other creative ways to make money and defraud investors if you have a large group of people willing to buy whatever stock/security you pitch to them. 

The SEC will notice odd market activity and sometimes it will be linked to WSB. The SEC will work with the mods to investigate the subreddit and that's easier if it goes private for a bit. 


TL;DR Market manipulation and SEC investigations can cause WSB to go private",g7t0hm0,2020-10-06 02:00:44,32

Vechain is not a coin so most people saying its a shitcoin dont even understand that Vechain is a two token model (VET and VTHO) with highly underestimated importance of VTHO token and how much the price of one depends on the price of other.

VET is one of the rare tokens where you can easily calculate how much should it approximately be worth based on VTHO price. Things on crypto move fast and one day someone will eat up whole VTHO sell wall, that will be the day VET (and VTHO) holders will be rewarded. In order to see VET increase in price, i believe we must first see VTHO outperform VET and much higer VTHO/VET ratio.",g7tgo69,2020-10-06 04:11:25,6
chadsterlington,"I think the increased popularity of SPACs has attracted some of the ""get rich quick"" crowd and they don't tend to have patience. This crowd also tends to FOMO and get onto the bandwagon way too late. These are the people that bought bitcoin at $20k, NKLA at $90, and SHLL at $58 . No wonder they panic. 

I have a few friends like this.... we all got into SHLL when it was sub $20. After the crazy ride up, they panic every time it's down 5%. Really?? We just rode this thing up over 100% and you panic over a couple point drop?? I don't personally understand it. To me there are two strategies for playing SPACs:

1 - Trading - Get in early and sell after hype. VTIQ / NKLA was a great example of this. Good to make money off of short term, but not a long term hold. 

2- Investing - Legitimate long term investments - In my opinion SHLL/HYLN  and FMCI fall into this category. If this is your strategy, then don't pay attention to the daily ups and downs because SPACs are extremely volatile.",g7tgtvg,2020-10-06 04:12:40,9

We have removed tons of crap (mostly articles copied from Wikipedia, some doxxing, obviously illegal stuff, porn, promotions of scam sites), **but I think this particular episode has nothing to do with ""\*CENSORSHIP* READ.CASH...""**, at best it is ""\*CENSORSHIP* TOBIAS RUCK..."", but frankly I see it as his right to leave only people that he wants to hear. His own bubble, no problems with that.

You're claiming censorship on read.cash behalf, but **nobody here is preventing you from publishing your comment as an article as a response to Tobias.** Which is actually even better, because you can publish a long-form content with proofs, images, etc...

The blocking mechanism is there to resolve conflicts effectively instead of an endless drama. People block other people and that's it, the conflict is done.  In my view, your article is your space, if you don't want to see something there, you have the right to see it gone and not deal with it. If somebody is actively trolling you and stalking you, you don't want to see that persons comments under your articles. Removing this for you, but leaving for others, that's worse, now you have to constantly login-logout to see if that person is writing something bad/wrong/lies about you on YOUR article.

Though, I think many people that actually care about BCH learned to ignore the IFP non-sense. Look at tippers on that post - it's a typical IFP gang: JStodd (paid AVAX supporter, here to sow chaos), micropresident (King of $5 meme kids / Mr. ""I'm building a read.cash clone for $25k""), Cain (can't say anything bad about him, but he is an avid IFP supporter).

One more thing: Tobias is obviously going the IFP way. read.cash is not. As previously noted, after the November fork, what read.cash calls ""Bitcoin Cash"" would be defined by BCHN. So, the IFP gang will be there, still trying to devastate as much of community as possible and it's in your power to block them too to prevent them from crapping on YOUR articles, instead of seeing crap under your articles endlessly.

P.S. By OP: ""Goerge[sic] ""I have nothing else to do than make crypto coin propaganda, grabbing funds from DASH now BCH, while not delivering anything"" Donnelly""... geee.. I wonder why people block this nice guy. Don't do this stuff on read.cash though - personal attacks will lead to a ban.

Elean0rZ,"As a general comment, any given sub is going to have some cult-like qualities. The point of subs is to discuss the specific thing the sub is intended for, so there's nothing wrong with being focussed on that thing. But, of course, being focussed on something is a slippery slope towards cultishness, so the question is where do you draw the line. r/CryptoCurrency has cultlike qualities as well, after all; the difference is that here it's more about crypto in general, rather than any single project.

Specifically about Bitcoin, you have to remember that Bitcoin is the big daddy. It started the whole thing, so in addition to the usual fanboying that you'd find in any sub, there are additional layers of ideology and mythology, stemming from Bitcoin's idealistic early days and the now-almost-godlike status of Satoshi, and there are also additional layers of resentment since--from the perspective of the true maximalists--altcoins simply dilute and distract from the One True Purpose of crypto, which is for Bitcoin to become the One True Money (this is all ironic considering that the point of crypto is to be decentralized and open-source, so you'd think it would be axiomatic that anyone could do anything they wanted with the tech, but...). Anyway, my point here is that the Bitcoin sub has the same basic issues as any other sub, but turned up a few notches because of its longer history, deeper sense of identity, and, in effect, near-religious faith in Bitcoin as a concept.

But then you also have to look into Bitcoin's history to get the whole picture. Specifically, for years there were antagonistic factions within Bitcoin, which ultimately led to the BTC - BCH split in 2017. To massively oversimplify, the disagreement was around approaches to scaling Bitcoin, and about what those approaches meant for what Bitcoin fundamentally was. But it was made worse by the way it all went down. On one side were so-called ""big blockers"", who tended to adhere to a more originalist, grassroots, and idealistic vision; on the other side were ""small blockers"", who tended to adhere to a more corporate and pragmatic vision. Without getting into the pros and cons, what matters to your question is that the ""small blockers"" had more resources and influence, first in the form of control over major Bitcoin-related communities (r/Bitcoin, BitcoinTalk, etc), and second in the form of developer/lobby groups like Blockstream. Setting aside the question of whether the big or small block approach made more sense for Bitcoin, the small blockers were able to, essentially, control the narrative. From the small blockers' perspective, all they did was suppress trolls and keep the conversation focussed on Bitcoin's rightful development path; from the big blockers' perspective, the small blockers engaged in unreasonable censorship, suppressed discussion, and hijacked the future of Bitcoin. 

Again, whether we think this was for the best or not, the outcome was that r/Bitcoin became a place for people on the small block side, while r/btc became a place of protest for those on the large block side who were being censored from r/Bitcoin, and, after the BCH fork, became the home for Bitcoin Cash. The scars of that split are still present, with each side distrusting the other and layering fervent tribalism on top of the already robust maximalism intrinsic to all Bitcoin flavours. Personally, I find that both the BTC folks and the BCH folks are prone to annoying behaviour, and that the whole thing is like Democrats vs. Republicans or Israel vs. Palestine--like, there might be legitimate points to be made on both sides, but no one can calm down for long enough to cut through the chest-thumping and rhetoric and actually make them. So we end up with echo-chambers on both sides--which, again, is similar to what we see in other subs, just more entrenched and bitter.",g7tv512,2020-10-06 05:57:51,12

Is what i used along with some quick guides on r/ethstaker.

I honestly recommend you don't use windows, (it's what i used) and I'm not familiar with linux. But in the long run it would be the best to use linux. 

Here is my attempt at a guide if you want to play around using windows and prysm. A lot of the guides are split between multiple web pages and by the end of it my browser looked like the end of a college research paper. So here is my attempt to consolidate it using windows and prysm.

**This is for Windows**

**STEP 1 - Getting Your Beacon Node up and Running**

For windows, I had a separate SSD that I used for everything eth2.0 validating related. The actual beacon chain data was stored on my C: drive. 

I used prysm - so that is my reference point. Make a new folder named prysm wherever you want.  

I just had it in my G: drive. You will be going there a lot using the terminal. remember the path to it (i.e. 

    G:\prysm or C:\Program Files\prysm, wherever you make that folder.)

Open up command prompt in windows (click windows icon&gt;search cmd&gt; run it)

It will take you to a black screen window. If your prysm folder is in your main HDD or SSD 

    (C:\) 

you are ready for next step. If you opted to put it in a separate HDD/SSD you will need to switch drives.

Just type the letter of the drive and : and press enter. Example: If it was in your G: drive just type

    G:

press enter

then navigate to the prysm folder type cd and copy paste the path the prysm folder. cd means change directory

    cd G:\prysm  or cd C:\Program Files\prysm

Follow prysm installation guide, mostly copy and paste the instructions remembering to change the path names to the ones that match your instance

1. once you are in the prysm folder it should look like

    G:\prysm    

copy and paste (**don't copy and paste my link use the actual prysm docs link for safe practice**)

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/master/prysm.bat --output prysm.bat    

I didn't run an eth 1.0 node because i didn't want to deal with syncing it. I remember doing that with bitcoin years ago and i really don't have the time. However, with actual eth staking I would run an eth 1.0 node and sync it (that will take a long time) I used a third party node infura. 

    Open up your browser go to infura and create account. 

    Log in&gt;click ethereum&gt;click new project&gt;name it&gt;click on the project&gt;Settings&gt;

    Under ""Keys"" change endpoint to Gorli&gt; copy the https link underneath 

Now go back to the terminal 

Make sure you are in the prysm folder still and type in 

       prysm.bat beacon-chain --http-web3provider=&lt;YOUR_ETH1_NODE_ENDPOINT_without the =&lt;&gt; &gt;

delete everything after = sign and after it and paste (ctrl V) your infura link

It should look like this, where everything before \prysm.bat is the path to your prsym folder and after web3provider includes your link the your infura Gorli endpoint (there is space between proveider and your infura link)

    G:\prysm\prysm.bat beacon-chain --http-web3provider &lt;YOUR_ETH1_NODE_ENDPOINT&gt;

Your beacon node will now start syncing, it will take about about a day at it's current size. If everything is done right. And now you wait for you beacon node to sync. it will show you the progress and the estimated time in the terminal window. ctrl mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the command prompt terminal window.


**Congratulations, your eth 2.0 beacon node should be running properly and syncing now**


**STEP 2 - Getting Your Validator Keys**


Next go to the [medalla launch pad](https://medalla.launchpad.ethereum.org/overview) and follow that instruction. Download the eth 2.0 client and extract the folder to wherever you want (i would keep it in the same drive as your prysm folder) [https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-deposit-cli/releases](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-deposit-cli/releases) download the latest windows zip file under assets (as of now it is v.0.4.1 ""I am Zinkin...)

**I included links to everything but NEVER NEVER NEVER download using links from random people online (which I am) Find the official sites yourself and download it that way. PRACTICE SAFETY make sure the certificates match up, official sites, and the url is spelled correctly etc**

Get your 32 test net ether Gorli Eth via ethstaker discord or the clients discord or a faucet. Use metamask, change network to Gorli. You don't want to send real eth. I won't go in depth with this part, you should know the basics of working with ether and metamask if you plan on staking. 

After extracting the eth2.0 cli folder, I recommend changing the name of the folder to something manageable (ex. eth2deposit-cli)

Open up a new Command Prompt terminal. Navigate to the new eth2deposit-cli folder. Remember if it's in another drive you first have to change drives by typing the letter of the drive the folder is in and : then enter. If it's in the main C:\ drive just type cd and copy and paste the path the eth2deposit-cli folder

    cd G:\eth2deposit-cli

then copy/paste (change the 1 to whatever amount of validators you are running) (the instruction on the launchpad are clear I'm just putting it here to be redundant)

    deposit.exe --num_validators 1 --chain medalla    

follow instructions that show up. Here is where your mnemonic shows up (physically write it down). Create strong password for the wallet and write it down

After you finish that part, go back to the eth2deposit cli folder you should see a new folder validator_keys folder. Make sure there are 2 files and deposit data file and a keystore file. Upload the deposit_data.json file to the launchpad to make sure you are on the right chain and everything is good (medalla/zinken/etc.) 

Continue following the instruction &gt; you have to send the Goeth to the contract now. **Make sure you are on the Gorli Test net and you aren't sending real eth somewhere** It will confirm.

**Congratulations, you have your Eth 2.0 validating keys**


**STEP 3 - Running your Validator Keys**

Next up is running the actual Validator now

Open up a new command prompt terminal window,

Navigate to the prysm folder (you should know how to do it by now)


    G:

    cd G:\prysm

now you have to import the validating keys into prysm. delete everything after the =sign and paste the path to the validator key folder

    prysm.bat validator accounts-v2 import --keys-dir=&lt;loaction of your validator keys folder without the &lt;&gt; &gt;

Should look something like this    

    prysm.bat validator accounts-v2 import --keys-dir=G:\eth2deposit-cli\validator_keys

Follow instructions - and you are done.
 
You just have to wait for your beacon node to sync and then a little while extra for your validator to be activated on the chain. 


[https://beaconcha.in/](https://beaconcha.in/) is where you can view the list of pending validators and you can copy and paste your GOeth address to view your validators progress and operations.


Most problems I encountered were typos with regards to file/folder names and pathing errors (i would copy and paste but not properly change the path to my personal folders/files)

It's a good learning experience. The instructions from the prysm team and medalla launch pad are great. But they assume you know the absolute basics, which i obviously didn't know about.  I did not know about changing drives which caused some headaches at first. Google-fu is your friend, the folks over at r/ethstaker are great and immensely helpful. Discord rooms (ethstaker, prysm) are also filled with kind folks.

Links to those can be found at the their webpages and r/ethstaker sidebars. **Remember don't click on my links and use them, go find it yourself using official sources.**

&gt;The number of satoshi (21,000,000 * 100,000,000) just fits in a standard IEEE floating point number so satoshi can be added and subtracted by floating point with no loss of precision. It requires 51 bits of the 53 available bits.


&gt;In the early days of bitcoin some code used floating point, possibly including some of the original Satoshi code. As well many languages use floats for library calls and a number of languages, including JavaScript, internal store all numbers as floating point.


&gt;Financial systems should use the 128 bit representations designed for financial use. Java has the BigDecimal class, and C# has the decimal type but in the early bitcoin days some floating point was used.

TheGarbageStore,"In the US, crypto is heterodox amongst financial advisors, although this is changing.   One of the most common criticisms is a lack of use cases.   But, citizenship in America conveys a privileged perspective: there is a severe shortage of not just sound money, but sound-adjacent fiat money like USD.   

The Turkish lira is hitting a new all-time low vs. the USD today.   There are 83m people in Turkey and on average they make USD $377 per month, which is $4524 per year.   They don't want to see their savings eradicated by inflation.  They want exposure to USD, and they want hard money.  Crypto is the most secure, easiest way to accomplish that.  If each of those people wanted to keep a paltry sum of $100 in USD as an emergency fund, that would eat up over half of the total Tether market cap, and that's just one country under 100m people.  Low friction makes Tether and similar coins an easy way to get exposure to US abroad.  There is a massive, massive demand for digital assets.

So, how does that affect Bitcoin pricing?  Well, they want Bitcoin too, not just fiat, or fiat stablecoins (which may be better than fiat due to sovereignless remittance).   It is one of the easiest assets to hold for much of the world and exposure to Bitcoin *reduces* risk.

1MightBeAPenguin,"&gt;It has nothing to do with transaction fees. Bitcoin Cash is the experiment that has made that clear as day.

Yes it absolutely does. That's why a lot of popular merchants who used to accept Bitcoin said they're not taking it anymore. Steam would've been one of the biggest merchants for Bitcoin payments, but they didn't want to because of the compromised user experience.

Fees being expensive and the blocksize being capped has prevented more transactions from happening on the network (regardless of whether they are transactions of value or not) with the promise of Lightning delivering. Merchants who were previously accepting just Bitcoin now have to make a change to accept Lightning Bitcoins.

This leads to many issues, most of which can be boiled down to the fact that the sum of channel balances will be a large sum of money that has to be settled on-chain to ultimately sell for fiat and payment processing. There's no way around that...

Bitcoin Cash's lack of success doesn't prove that big-block Bitcoin would've been/is a failure. Crypto is a lot more political than it should be. Ultimately, mini bull-runs along with temporary fee spikes would actually be bad for Bitcoin's security long term. In the last 3 years alone, Bitcoin has lost 85% of its security despite only falling 40%-45% in price. For Bitcoin Cash, that number is 95%, but is likely to become more sustainable as it becomes less volatile. The same can't be said for Bitcoin.",g82gvyb,2020-10-08 11:01:38,6
TheGreatMuffin,"&gt; Isn't this the exact same reason BTC exists? To enable users to pay less for faster transactions?

Bitcoin's most valuable properties are uncensorable transactions, verifiability (of supply and your own transactions), lack of single points of failure and the hard cap on supply. Being fast and cheap is really not one of its strong sides (at least when compared to networks like VISA).  

Being relatively slow and expensive when compared to centralized networks is one of the trade offs bitcoin has to make to be highly secure, permissionless and trustless. Just like a tank has to make certain trade offs for the advantages it has to offer in battle (being relatively slow and ""clunky"" but insanely powerful and tough to deal with).",g82mlld,2020-10-08 11:50:46,4

soccersousa,"From page 41 of the [report](https://www.justice.gov/ag/page/file/1326061/download):

Anonymity enhanced cryptocurrencies.

The acceptance of anonymity enhanced
cryptocurrencies or “AECs”—such as Monero,
Dash, and Zcash—by MSBs and darknet
marketplaces has increased the use of this
type of virtual currency. As discussed above,
because AECs use non-public or private
blockchains, use of these cryptocurrencies
may undermine the AML/CFT controls used
to detect suspicious activity by MSBs and
other financial institutions, and may limit
or even negate a business’s ability to conduct
AML/CFT checks on customer activity and
to satisfy BSA requirements. Some AECs,
however, offer features, such as public
view keys, that potentially can facilitate
the fulfillment of AML/CFT obligations,
depending upon the implementation of such
features.

The Department considers the use of AECs
to be a high-risk activity that is indicative
of possible criminal conduct. In most
circumstances, the Department does not
liquidate seized or forfeited AECs, as doing
so allows them to re-enter the stream of
commerce for potential future criminal use.
Companies that choose to offer AEC products
should consider the increased risks of money
laundering and financing of criminal activity,
and should evaluate whether it is possible to
adopt appropriate AML/CFT measures to
address such risks.

AECs are often exchanged for other virtual
assets like bitcoin, which may indicate
a cross-virtual-asset layering technique
for users attempting to conceal criminal
behavior. This practice, which is commonly
referred to as “chain hopping,” is discussed
further below.",g84wty6,2020-10-09 03:52:02,6

99% of developer/specialist support with deep knowledge in cryptography, development, security with a proven track record of release secure well tested code and an ethos in minimizing centralization and maintaining compatibility, fungibility and privacy

Far more hashrate - http://fork.lol/pow/hashrate

Larger community of users with much better network effect

Far more merchant support

Far less mining centralization

Far more node decentralization

Most devs Road map is for conservative scaling and focus on security , privacy and fungibility.

Current capacity allowance is 14 TPS (transactions per second) average with most txs using segwit and millions of txs per second for LN payment channels

_______________________________________
**B Cash (BCH)**


One of 50+ UTXO altcoin spinoffs from Bitcoin https://blog.bitmex.com/44-bitcoin-fork-coins/

Few developers that are far less competent

Roadmap is focusing on cheap tx fees and many hard forks for larger capacity blocks at the risk of centralization and lower security. Favors externalizing costs onto full nodes and users

Currently doesn't have transaction malleability fixed so is stuck with a mere 224 TPS max throughput(but miners only allowing 56TPS now). Their focus is primarily on onchain scaling but are open the possibility up for L2.

Introduced another vulnerability with the HF called EDA that caused wild erratic difficulty swings and more inflation. They Hard forked to try and fix this with the DAA but thus far their difficulty is still more erratic than bitcoin.

Is still vulnerable to this PoW vulnerability - https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9230 which is largely neutralized in bitcoin with segwit

Some of the people that left might have had views you would consider dumb, but some might have had views that were basically the same as yours... we don't know.

Many people here have faulted some coinbase staff for walking out for outside-of-work things but not standing up against things like the hacking team acquisition, the company's  servility to absurd privacy invading rights oppressing regulators and law enforcement making demands outside of their remit, the company's conspicuous actions against the Bitcoin community, or their adoption of scammy ICOs.  For all we know these were major factors for some of the people who left... I doubt it was a single reason for most people.

It's okay for people to disagree. It's okay for people to have different priorities.  It makes me feel hopeful for humanity when people can sort out their disagreements in a civil and mutually respectful way.  The same thing that makes it okay for coinbase to ask employees to keep advocacy and politics out of the work place is what makes it okay for people to choose to not work there in response.

1MightBeAPenguin,"&gt;I think I am the minority about this, but it seems increasingly likely that BTC will add some fixed inflation before increasing the block limit? Something based on the coins not moved over X years so that the circulating supply of Bitcoin always remains under 21M, a sort of redefining of the old only ever 21M. 

It certainly is possible... It would be similar to the tail emission that Monero has, however such a change would require a hardfork, and likely cause a split in the community because of how controversial it is. Breaking the 21 million max supply of Bitcoin would be going against the social contract, which would be chaotic to say the least.

&gt;Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash having the same average total fees all other being equal would make Bitcoin more unstable since the revenue in ""fee markets"" are more volatile than a transactions per day over time. But just adding even the most marginal of fixed block rewards would sidestep the whole issue. 

Yes. It would be more volatile because miners are relying on a smaller group of people to pay more per transaction leads to an easier failure of the system. I think this could potentially lead to a chain death if banks and institutions really wanted it to. For a short burst of time, they can supply a lot of fees, increasing the hashrate, causing the DAA to increase difficulty, and then suddenly stop transferring anything, making the DAA a lot slower, and not allowing it to catch up for another confirmation.",g88xod2,2020-10-10 04:51:34,3

Collect enough Verde Points and you can trade them in for merch, perks, donate them to new features requests on our [github](https://github.com/softwareverde/bitcoinverde/issues) to show your support, or use them to voice your opinion on upcoming issues.

The way it works is the service monitors the donation address and then sends SLP tokens to the provided return-address (below the donation box).  If you don't provide an address then SLP are sent to the addresses used to send the coins.  (This means that if you donate from non-standard addresses, or from a wallet that does not support SLP then your tokens may be lost if you don't enter an address.)

The merch and physical-goods are priced fairly high because the tangible rewards are meant to be a way to show our appreciation without having to spend a bunch of time operating as a store that manages inventory, and shipping.  The rewards take time and money, and if we suddenly had a ton of orders then we wouldn't be able to spend as much time donating and it would diminish the value of your donation.

Basically what happened was we got a note from the homeowners insurance saying they would no longer cover our house because of the fact we had too many layers of shingles. Keep in mind the home was purchased under first-time home buyers and so it should have passed an inspection. I was really pissed off because I really didn't have money to be spending on a roof. So I went and got a second mortgage.


 I did the fucking repairs myself. And I  was pretty pissed in that moment and decided to pay myself as a contractor and rewarded myself with my first Bitcoin purchase in 2014.   I was so fucking frustrated at The Game of Life.

Now I just know how to manage the frustration a little bit better. I'm not greedy.   I've never done anything lavish. My family doesn't fly to Florida to vacation.... I drive. And it ain't Disney. Stuff like that.

We have goals as a family and one of those goals is to keep the kids at the school where they want to be and where we want them to be. And it's a private school.

JDHadwin,"In your last post you included a rather opinionated comparison of DGB to VET rather than just asking for honest opionions and I actually recall that thread and there was more than just people saying ""it's fast"" including a response of my own. But I will reply again and elaborate more on why I like Digibyte. 

First and foremost I like it for the decentralization and community aspect. Nobody is paid to work on it, nobody is employed by a Digibyte company or corporation. Yes there is the Digibyte Foundation but that is volunteer based and by donations only, I have donated to the dev fund myself though I think we also need more attention on the marketing side. When talking about the foundation there was news this year of Jared Tate stepping down from his role with the foundation to take a much deserved break. In doing so he has turned to the community, in a philosophical sense, to continue this project without him to prove that no *one* person is more important than Digibyte itself. I have nothing but respect for him and his decision to do so and I have full faith in the other members of the Digibyte Foundation to carry the project forward. Proving it’s true decentralization. 

Another reason to like it is the five algorithms used to mine DGB. What that does is make DGB more accessible to more people regardless of what equipment they use, unlike Bitcoin which I won't get into here. There is a hope that one day you will be able to mine DGB on your cell phone, still an *idea* or *dream* more than a developing project I think but I would love to be proven wrong about this, and I think that kind of vision is great to have for a project. Outside of the hopeful goals DGB is still one of the better options if you have minimal equipment because not only will the reward:electricity bill be better but you will also be more involved with a community. I am saving up for a mining rig to get into it myself. 

Speed is an obvious reason that apparently you are well aware of but another thing to consider is cost. DGB is fractions of a penny to send and along with the speed it makes it ideal for sending money or better yet *spending* money, or Digibyte. In a fantasy world of adoption Digibyte really makes sense in a lot of ways. 

Digi-ID is a valid reason to be bullish. Suppose this scenario, Coinbase has yet to list DGB but when they do they will be more aware of Digibyte as a platform. I will admit coinbase is a longshot example but it's easy to use for reference. If coinbase, or any other exchanges and wallets, were to learn about Digi-id they would be able to consider it to reduce on KYC requirements by having a trusted blockchain ID. The potential use of Digi-ID is massive and who else has a working Blockchain ID? Icon is developing one and Ontology has recently released something but both of those are centrally controlled proof-of-stake networks. Nothing against PoS but I am against centralized control of a blockchain with intentions of ID. I will add that I think NEO is developing something ID but they’re also centralized. I share this for research purposes if you wish to look more into this stuff. 

Decentralization, speed, algorithms, ideologies, and core values.If you only are about the charts than a reason to be bullish is that coinbase is rumoured to be listing it, they have developments with RenVM in the works and the activity has been very upward lately. I'm stocking up, I am biased to the project with everything I say.

Bitcoin is great and it's very unlikely Monero taking over Bitcoin, but it certainly offers fungibility and privacy, so you should probably turn some of your Bitcoin into Monero to obfuscate your total wealth from bad actors, plus using it over Bitcoin for payments for more financial privacy and receiving Monero over Bitcoin for not worrying about receiving tainted Bitcoin. And paying far cheaper fees with faster confirmation times.

You'll find there's a lot of overlap between Bitcoin' and Monero' communities, so Monero is basically Bitcoin's younger brother, looking up to his big brother and just trying to fill the gaps his big brother is not able to fill because he already has a lot of responsibilities and has less room to experiment. While his big brother looks proudly at his younger brother and wishes him success because he likes his ideas, it is his beloved brother, and it would be nice not bearing all the weight of the cryptoeconomy alone.

In a fiat currency, the value of a unit of currency is determined backed by the sum total goods and services you can buy with it--the whole market in that  currency.

Bitcoin currently functions more like a commodity than it does a currency, even though we could consider it ""fiat"" in some sense. And like a commodity, it experiences wide swings in value. It is generally a bad idea to invest a large portion of one's wealth in a commodity. If the market for that commodity collapses, you can lose your shirt.

Limp_Distribution,"When Your Last $166 Vanishes: ‘Fast Fraud’ Surges on Payment Apps

People are getting defrauded as they turn to Square’s Cash App and PayPal’s Venmo to do more online banking in the pandemic.

By Nathaniel Popper
Oct. 11, 2020, 3:24 p.m. ET
Charee Mobley, a middle school teacher in Fort Worth, Texas, was a fraud victim recently on Cash App.
Charee Mobley, a middle school teacher in Fort Worth, Texas, was a fraud victim recently on Cash App.Jake Dockins for The New York Times
Charee Mobley, who teaches middle school in Fort Worth, Texas, had just $166 to get herself and her 17-year-old daughter through the last two weeks of August.

But that money disappeared when Ms. Mobley, 37, ran into an issue with Square’s Cash App, an instant payments app that she was using in the coronavirus pandemic to pay her bills and do her banking.

After seeing an errant online shopping charge on her Cash App, Ms. Mobley called what she thought was a help line for it. But the line had been set up by someone who asked her to download some software, which then took control of the app and drained her account.

“I didn’t have gas money and I couldn’t pay my daughter’s senior dues,” Ms. Mobley said. “We basically just had to stick it out until I got paid the following week.”

In the pandemic, people have flocked to instant payment apps like Cash App, PayPal’s Venmo and Zelle as they have wanted to avoid retail bank branches and online commerce has become more ingrained. To encourage that shift, the payment apps have added services like debit cards and routing numbers so that they work more like traditional banks.

But many people are unaware of how vulnerable they can be to losses when they use these services in place of banks. Payment apps have long had fraud rates that are three to four times higher than traditional payment methods such as credit and debit cards, according to data from the security firms Sift and Chargeback Gurus.

A Cash App marketing campaign known as “Cash App Fridays” provided fraudsters with a ready phone book of potential victims, according to security experts.

The fraud appears to have surged in recent months as more people use the apps. At Venmo, daily users have grown by 26 percent since last year, while the number of customer reviews mentioning the words fraud or scam has risen nearly four times as fast, according to a New York Times analysis of data from Apptopia, a firm that tracks mobile services.

Driving the surge is the apps’ ease of use. People need just an email address to create a Cash App account and a phone number to make a Venmo account. That simplicity has made it seamless for thieves to set up accounts and to send requests for money to other users, something that was not possible with traditional bank payments.

The apps’ instantaneous transactions — compared to the two or three days needed for a standard bank transfer — have also meant that Venmo and Cash App have less time to detect whether a transaction is fraudulent.

“Fast payments equals fast fraud,” said Frank McKenna, the chief fraud strategist for the security firm PointPredictive. The apps, which are sometimes known as peer-to-peer payments services, “are super convenient for customers but that also makes them ripe targets,” he said.

Square, PayPal and Zelle do not disclose the rate of fraud on their apps. PayPal takes steps to “limit potential fraudulent activity and mitigate any customer impact,” a spokeswoman said, but she did not address whether it had seen more cases of fraud.

Zelle, which was founded by a coalition of banks, appears to have experienced less fraud because it has more robust authentication for new users and more legal protections in case of loss, security experts said.

“Protecting consumers from abusive scams and fraud is a top priority for Zelle,” said Meghan Fintland, a spokeswoman for Early Warning, the company that runs the app.

Of all the payment apps, fraud issues have been particularly acute for Square’s Cash App. As the number of people using the app daily has grown 59 percent over the last year, the number of reviews about it that mention the words fraud or scam has risen 165 percent, according to Apptopia.

Annual Growth in Payment Apps

The Better Business Bureau also said it had received more than twice as many complaints about Cash App as Venmo over the past year. That is significant given that Venmo has twice as many users as Cash App, according to Apptopia.

Lena Anderson, a spokeswoman for Square, said the company was “aware that there has been a recent rise in scammers trying to take advantage of customers using financial products, including Cash App. We’ve taken a number of proactive steps and made it our top priority.”

Square, which is led by Jack Dorsey, who is also chief executive of Twitter, introduced Cash App in 2013. While the San Francisco company was founded as a payments platform for small businesses, Cash App has become its largest source of revenue. In the second quarter, the app generated $1.2 billion of Square’s $1.9 billion in revenue.

But Cash App has been more vulnerable to fraud partly because of how it handles customers, security experts said. Square has until recently offered only email support for the app, not a phone number for its customers to call. That led some customers to fall for fake help line numbers, like the kind that Ms. Mobley confronted. Venmo, in contrast, has a chat line on its app that customers can use for a quick response.

Ms. Anderson said Square began rolling out a phone line for certain customers on Oct. 6. It plans to make the phone line available to all customers over time.

Cash App also appears to be more prone to fraud because of how Square has built the business, industry analysts said.

In 2017, Square began a marketing campaign called “Cash App Fridays,” which gives money to Twitter users who post their so-called $Cashtag or username. The campaign, security experts said, provided fraudsters with a phone book of potential victims.

It also led to copycat campaigns, where people claim to work for Cash App and say they will give away a large sum of money if users first send in a smaller sum. One Twitter account, @CashappG, has been online since 2019 with the tagline: “Hi welcome to Cash App give away! Send money and we will send you double back!”

“It gives scammers a ripe opportunity,” said Satnam Narang, a researcher at the security firm Tenable who has written about the fraud on Cash App.

Posts About Payment Apps on the Dark Net

Emily Bradford, an unemployed 21-year-old in Washington, said she lost $75 last month after getting a message through Twitter offering her $3,000 through Cash App if she paid an initial “clearance” payment. When she sent the money, the person who messaged her disappeared. She reached out to Cash App’s support email, but hasn’t heard back, she said.

“I figured since they were dealing with money, especially others’ money, they’d have a very good security system and customer service,” she said of Square.

Ms. Anderson, the Square spokeswoman, said the company had recently added warnings about copycats on its messages about Cash App Fridays.

In 2018, Square also introduced the ability for people to transact in Bitcoin on Cash App. That has made it easier to move illicit gains off the app because Bitcoin can be sent to anonymous addresses that are much harder to trace or reverse than traditional financial transactions. Venmo and Zelle don’t offer Bitcoin.

Cash App’s popularity for fraudulent schemes is evident from conversations and listings on dark net forums and markets, where criminals gather to do business. In August, Cash App was mentioned 10,577 times on dark net forums, up 450 percent from a year earlier, according to an analysis by the security firm Sixgill. Listings for Venmo and Zelle rose around 50 percent on the dark net in the same period.


Ashley Tolley, outside her home in Travelers Rest, S.C. A fraudster recently cost her $560 on Cash App.Melissa Golden for The New York Times
Ashley Tolley, 31, a mother of three in Travelers Rest, S.C., recently experienced the criminal activity on Cash App firsthand.

In August, she said, she received requests on the app from addresses that appeared to be legitimate, but with a letter or two changed. While some of the transactions were rejected by Square, one went ahead without her approval. The thief took $560, which was a month of child support payments from the father of her two youngest children, from her account.

Square told Ms. Tolley that she could ask the fraudster to send the money back to her. But the person had already deleted their Cash App account.

“I’m the sole provider in my household,” she said. “For that to be gone — I broke down, I was in tears.”

bitusher,"&gt;hash operations a supercomputer could do? 

https://www.top500.org/lists/top500/2020/06/

Fastest one is 	Supercomputer Fugaku 415,530 TFlop/s 

Average modern ASIC now is running at 80-120 TH/s 

T/Flopps and T/Hs are different values not directly comparable. It is unfair to compare a general purpose supercomputer with a Bitcoin ASIC . Even if all the Supercomputers worldwide were hijacked and mined Bitcoin they would only be able to mine a very small fraction of Bitcoins global hashrate. 

Here is some math to get a rough idea of the conversion between T/Flopps and T/Hs

1 integer operation = 2 floating point operations

1 hash = 6.35K integer operations

1 hash = 12.7K floating point operations

A single ASIC can mine at ~100,000,000,000,000 hashes these days and there are millions of ASICs mining

A single ASIC thus has 1,270,000,000,000,000,000 Flop/s  in sha256 computing hashrate ability

A single ASIC thus has 1,270,000 TFlop/s  in sha256 computing hashrate ability

**So A single modern ASIC is more than twice as fast at mining Bitcoin than the best supercomputer**

Hustlebible,"Hello! Firstly, congratulations on the score. In the US, 1099s are issued for poker tournaments in the event of a NET win of $5000 or more. Which means, if the tournament was, lets say, $500 to enter, and you cashed for $5499, you would not get tax paperwork. That being said, you are technically obligated to report any earnings regardless if you got paperwork for it or not. If you keep track of your poker earnings and losses then you likely have tournament losses to offset this win and would only be taxed on the net for the year if there is a net. Bovada is not US based so they won't be reporting anything on their end, but any transfers of bitcoin into cash into your bank accounts have the possibility of being flagged as suspicious by your bank. However, none of this really matters unless you get audited. 95% of the time you can probably do nothing and it will be fine, though that is not what you are supposed to do. No one here including myself will recommend techniques for tax evasion because this is illegal, however, its to my understanding that the US lumps all gambling together, whether its lottery tickets, sports betting, or poker, so hypothetically speaking, a handful of scratch off tickets from your local 7/11 trashcan could offset this win, or any cash game losses at your local casino. (receipts from the ATM at the casino are a good record to indicate, plus a record book of the session time/date/location and buy in/cash out) To be on the straight and narrow, you should report your net earnings for the year in poker, and pay your marginal tax rate for those earnings.",g8q1t4w,2020-10-14 04:38:29,5

Talinoth,"Well the low resistance matters a lot too.

Why do computers make so much heat? You could heat up your house in a Siberian winter with a bitcoin farm.

For example, in computer CPUs. You know why we can't make CPUs that run 10s, 100s, 1000s of times faster than they do currently?

Why are CPUs so small, why not clock them faster, why not just add more silicon?

Among other things, it's because the resistance across the circuit from the electricity used to power the device doesn't just disappear... that wasted power is being transformed to **heat.**

A *lot* of heat, in a relatively small area. We're still stuck with ""2D"" cpus, instead of stacking the silicon like pancakes to make ""3D"" cpus, because adding more would create an absurd amount of heat beyond our ability to cool.

If we had low pressure, room temperature superconductors, that wouldn't be a problem anymore. *Zero resistance*. *Zero waste heat.* Heat becomes a trivial problem instead of the main roadblock.

CPU performance would surge upwards unstoppably. Well, until they come into contact with annoying quantum effects and hilariously high error rates but that's another matter for another time.

MobTwo,"Ever since Bitcoin had an upgrade into Bitcoin Cash on 1st August 2017, I have been bullish for Bitcoin Cash’s long term future. As follows are my personal opinions on why I feel Bitcoin Cash is the future of digital cash over the outdated BTC.

&amp;nbsp;

**Better Security** – BTC has a vulnerability called RBF which increases the risk of double spending. Bitcoin Cash developers aim to make 0-confirmation transactions safe again so that anyone accepting Bitcoin Cash is much safer accepting payments without having to wait for multiple confirmations. This RBF security vulnerability exists only in BTC and not Bitcoin Cash. That's why Bitcoin Cash is more secure as a payment method.

Here is an example of hackers stolen $150000 worth of BTC using the RBF security vulnerability. https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/03/14/double-spenders-scam-150000-bitcoin/

It is super easy to double spend on Bitcoin using the RBF vulnerability. Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/video-shows-how-easy-it-is-to-double-spend-btc-using-rbf/

&amp;nbsp;

**Improved Scalability** – BTC is limited to 1MB block size and even with Segwit activated, the capacity increase is only around 1.7x whereas the upgraded Bitcoin Cash blocks capacity is currently at 32x with no limitations. This means Bitcoin Cash can handle PayPal transactions volume today and be global money after a few more upgrades.

&amp;nbsp;

**Supply Scarcity** – During the fork from Bitcoin, some Bitcoin Cash supply were removed from active circulation due to users unable to claim their Bitcoin Cash from unsupported exchanges and wallets among other reasons. This means each Bitcoin Cash is actually more scarce than BTC.

&amp;nbsp;

**Improved Confirmation Times** – Due to the limited block size of BTC, some users were made to wait days for their transactions to be confirmed. Contrast this to Bitcoin Cash where transactions may be accepted immediately with less risk and you can see why it makes sense to use Bitcoin Cash. In other words, if you are a shop owner and you just sold a cup of coffee and some sandwiches, and you accept the old BTC, you may have to wait hours for the transaction to be confirmed because the customer may use RBF to void the original payment. With Bitcoin Cash, your risk is minimized.

&amp;nbsp;

**Higher Merchants Adoption** - Bitcoin Cash is global money with more than 2,651,820 merchants accepting it. You can pay for your hotels, air tickets, food/drinks, groceries, nightlife, and more with Bitcoin Cash today. Source: https://1bch.com/?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame

While Bitcoin Cash adoption is growing very quickly every single day, Bitcoin is having declining adoption and if this trend continues then Bitcoin is on a dead end. Source: https://np.reddit.com/r/NotAcceptingBitcoin/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all

&amp;nbsp;

**Low Fees** – One of the advantages of using cryptocurrencies over traditional payment methods is the low fees. Due to the limited block size of BTC, fees have exceeded over $70/transaction during peak period. On the other hand, I have never paid more than 1 penny/transaction during my entire time in using Bitcoin Cash. This makes using Bitcoin Cash ideal for merchants, businesses, companies and everyday usage. The industries that may be disrupted such as Remittances, Payment Gateways, etc are worth trillions of dollars and Bitcoin Cash is well positioned for use cases in these industries.

&amp;nbsp;

**Lightning Network Problems And Vulnerabilities And Loss Funds** - Some people may claim Lightning Network will solve Bitcoin problems but it has failed to gain traction due to many problems and vulnerabilities, such as loss of funds, unreliable transactions (constantly failing), and many other vulnerabilities.

Source: https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/why-does-the-bitcoin-lightning-network-fail-new-study-proves-inefficiency/

Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/researchers-scathing-lightning-network-analysis-finds-flaws/

&amp;nbsp;

**Tokens** - Bitcoin Cash has tokens to start taking some marketshare from Ethereum. Today, anyone can issue their own loyalty tokens or digital money on Bitcoin Cash from as low as 1 cent to mint it. It's incredibly easy and anyone can do it at https://mint.bitcoin.com/

&amp;nbsp;

**Better Privacy** - Bitcoin Cash has better privacy than BTC thanks to CashShuffle/CashFusion. You can enable it through the setting in the Electron Cash wallet and it's completely optional. If you don't want others to know how you spent your money, it is better to use Bitcoin Cash over BTC.

&amp;nbsp;

**Better Risk/Reward** - If BTC gains another 250 billion marketcap, it only 2x in price. But that same 250 billion will give you more than 50x your Bitcoin Cash investments. It is such a smarter option given the risk/rewards probabilities.

&amp;nbsp;

At the moment, the old BTC has network effects advantages just like how Friendster used to dominate the social networking space. It is inevitable that Bitcoin Cash will overtake BTC's marketcap in the end.",g8xaj7b,2020-10-16 03:38:43,5

PrivateButPublic,"You have a few misconceptions.  
Hashrate has no influence on how many XMR are emitted. The XMR protocol has the goal of 1 block every 2 minutes. If the hashrate rises, which means faster blocks, the mining difficulty will be adjusted by the protocol so the 2 minute goal is hit again. In Monero this happens every block with a 200 (I believe) block average, so it's a very fast adjustment.  
This means the amount of XMR emitted per year is a set value, and the supply is only increased linearly.  
The inflationrate will decrease forever heading to 0%. In 2022 when the tail emission begins, it will only be a 0.87% yearly inflation, decreasing every year (after 10 years, it will only be a 0.79% inflation).  

This means the effect on price is absolutely minimal, sub-1%.

bawdyanarchist,"Keep in mind that LN is -- I wouldn't say intractable -- but a very difficult problem to solve, and riddled with deficiencies.  There are some here who believe it to be mathematically unsolvable. 

- First is the game-theory economics of it.  In order to spend and receive money, you first have to put money into it, not just the money you want to spend/receive.  This is counterintuitive, and an extra burden for users.  It would be like, in order for you to receive your $1500/week paycheck, you have to already have $1500 in your account (channel capacity). 

- And who wants to just lock up $1500 into your channel with no real reward except the pittance in LN fees they *might* get, all the while risking some malicious attack by you.

- Routing.  Sucks.  Bigly.  It's not like the internet where the next hop in the chain aids in the routing.  No, instead the sender has to do all of the path discovery.  And those paths constantly change as node/channel balances change.  Result?  Payments get stuck.  Bolt spec demands in certain cases that channels get closed.  Onchain settlement is forced.  1MB blocks are woefully inadequate to handle the kind of capacity that would be ultimately needed. 

- Which brings us to flood attacks.  Basically, high onchain fees can make it profitable for an attacker to flood LN with send to self txs.  Since the receive gets paid first, and then back propagates along the path, the sender (who is also the receiver), refuses to pay the final hop, knowing that the onchain congestion makes it likely that the person in the middle won't be able to get their refund tx in on time before the timelock ends.  Think of it as an effective double spend, with the first routing node picking up the bill. 

- Back to routing. Path discovery requires well known public network topology. This is inherently antithetical to privacy.  So if these LN maxis ever want to get the network functioning smoothly, part of the cost will come in the form of privacy. 

- Bugs bugs bugs.  I have personal friends who got funds stuck and lost in LN. The network starts crashing at anything resembling use surges. 

- It's not even Bitcoin. You can enter LN with LTC.  And other coins with an appropriate signature/scripting scheme.  And no, you can't just swap for LTC and exit there if BTC gets too congested, because the swap still requires the ability to settle on the BTC chain if the swap enters failure mode.

Now I'm not saying that LN could never mature.  Or that some of these problems aren't solvable.  But I am saying that it has been 3 years, and the network and code are nothing resembling maturity or production ready.  And it doesn't look like another 3 years will be enough to get it smoothed out either.  Maybe, just maybe, by then it'll be looking more reasonably optimistic.

It could very well be that our best scaling option is to hope for hardware/bandwidth improvements, and to expect some level of low level server hardware/bandwidth to run the nodes. Think 100TB storage and a gigabit connection. 

Yeah thats not ideal, but it's better than trying to scale with some re-centralized federated trust model, a marginally functional LN, or just not scaling at all.",g8ykl3w,2020-10-16 10:32:43,4

jtoomim,"This release contains two significant performance enhancements of mine:

1. [MR !442](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/merge_requests/442) makes the `sendtoaddress` RPC call around 100x faster with large wallet files when the new `coinsel` argument is set to 1 or 2. This allows BCHN to generate transactions at 30 tx/sec to 200 tx/sec instead of around 0.3 tx/sec on large wallet files. This feature is intended mostly to be used for stress testing on e.g. [scalenet](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/merge_requests/750), but may also be useful for businesses with the need for high peak transaction throughput. I'll try to publish a short article on how to generate buttloads of spam on scalenet using BCHN v22.1.0 soon.
2. [MR !809](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/merge_requests/809) adds an optimization to the CheckRegularTransaction() function that reduces the amount of time needed to generate, validate, and propagate a 32 MB block by about 140 ms per hop. That ""per hop"" bit is pretty important: ultimately, this should speed up the latency-critical path for 32 MB blocks by close to 1 second. While that's not a game-changing improvement, it's quite respectable given that the code change needed to achieve this is only about 10 lines of simple new code, plus some reformatting, comments, and tests.

And this is only the start. We've got a lot more coming soon.

kenchikka,"The really important thing to take note here, in my opinion, is what he talks around 3 minutes into the video. He talks about **cash** and how Central Banks could create a digital version of a currency with **some attributes** of cash. Then he goes on to say that people really enjoy the fact that cash is **privacy-preserving** but that it would be impossible for a Central Bank to provide such feature because ""money laundering"" and ""funding terrorists"" -- because these things are not happening at this exact moment with dollars.

A CBDC would and will completely eradicate financial privacy to the citizens. And although I understand most people don't give a single fuck about their privacy and are more than happy to have all their personal and financial data harvested by public and private entities alike, this would be a very negative to society in general. There's absolutely no reason to believe Central Banks and other regulatory entities wouldn't freeze your transactions, balances, wallets, at a whim. And with the death of cash you wouldn't have an alternative to operate in the traditional financial system.

This brings me to the part of the discussion that I find interesting, because anyone who understand how Bitcoin works also understands the lack of privacy it has. Chain analysis is real and even if you have the money and the amount of technical knowledge to use one of the (imperfect) methods to ""mix"" your coins, there are still chances you can be tracked. I know this subreddit focus its conversation mainly in Bitcoin but videos like these just make me realize the importance of other cryptocurrencies that enshrine the attributes of cash like fungibility and privacy, which Bitcoin unfortunately lacks.

Keyword is living, yes. Usually on government support programs. They would be likely dead if they were in regions of East Europe, the Middle East, Africa, or West Asia. Not to mention the fact that poverty has gone down massively since the 1950's. 
And not just in America, which actually doesn't make up the entirety of North America and Western Europe.  

&gt;Folks being killed by police with little to no real justification or provocation ""have it made"".

Police kill on average 1000 people per year, and its likely not a lot of those people are innocent. For comparison, about 38000 people die in car crashes per year. Though American cops are corrupt, it isn't rampant enough to be a country destroying problem. Nor is it related to capitalism, but thats certainly an interesting and effective way to hijack a social issue for your own purpose.

stobabuinov,"I like you, OP. You're saying suppose the money disappears from people who obtained it by ignoble means. This is a good-natured thought experiment.

Like other people are saying, value is subjective, and the way by which the money disappears makes all the difference. Because if it disappears through a government dictate, people lose faith in the money system itself (""If the government destroys money by this criteria today, they can do anything tomorrow""), and so the dollar goes to shit and is replaced by Bitcoin.

Alternatively, suppose the money disappears through a force of nature, and everybody understands this, and also understands that there will be no other interventions. In that ideal case, a process of price discovery will follow, where supply and demand come to terms with one another, with the price level eventually dropping to half of what it was. Because for the same amount of goods and services, there is only half the money, so everything must cost half.

Every realistic scenario falls somewhere in between these two extremes.",g96ad44,2020-10-18 12:05:41,2

szyblaszczyk,"I don't know what to think if I'm bullish or bearish. I was always prepared for event like this and as I'm in cryptocurrencies for years, nothing will suprise me, depress or excite much. What happens to crypto after stocks will burst (if they do) or if they are going to inflate them with printed money indefinitely, I have no idea. This is uncharted territory and China virus in times like this is not surprising for me either. This is huge political, economic game and we are tiny players in it.

It is what it is. Whole crypto world (even Bitcoin) still has relatively very low market cap (considering extreme hidden inflation and pure money creation inflating stocks) and whether we have manipulation here or it's the beginning of an end for CRO, everybody should know that and be ready for extremes.

My advices as a person who's also in CROs not deep but have some as I like this ""project"":

1) If you have some big bills to pay upfront, now is the time as cashback will be much nicer now

2) If you think it's temporary and don't want to sell (usually bad idea to sell after such violent drop), make use of every single coin and put into Supercharger, buy discounted coins during Syndicate events. If you are staking now, remember that everyday you get more CRO so it eases the pain

3) If you keep most of your crypto on Crypto.com, consider moving it to a safer space. We never know what happens, we had Bitconnect, we had hacks etc. (Not saying that as a comparison to Crypto.com)

4) Don't go all in Crypto.com coin now as it seems to be cheap now, just buy some if you think it will be fine and maybe some more later

5) It was wild ride for Crypto.com in 2020. Maybe top 10 in market cap in such short time was way too much. Cheaper CRO might mean in loads of people registering on Crypto.com during next bull run. They have good marketing. Question is if they are honest and if they will have now good enough offer to encourage more customers.

Good luck.",g9ajtf8,2020-10-19 12:58:38,2

SenatusSPQR,"The way I see it, Litecoin isn't competing with Bitcoin. The Bitcoin enthusiasts have taken a stand with their ""store of value"" mantra, and they seem to measure this in terms of the hash rate. Now, I'm not saying I agree with this assessment, but it's the hill they've chosen to .. stand on. 

In that sense, Litecoin doesn't compete with Bitcoin, because no crypto *can* compete with Bitcoin in that regard, pretty much by design. Bitcoin is completely inefficient in every sense, but it was the first one, and Litecoin can never beat Bitcoin in being the first crypto and having the highest hash rate/longest history.

Litecoin is more of a payment crypto, and in that sense it's competing with other crypto*currencies* like maybe Dash, Nano, Monero etc. I'm afraid to be seen as shilling by explaining how I think Litecoin loses to several of those, so suffice it to say I don't think Litecoin does well in *that* comparison either.

While we wait for progress, the favorite pastime of Redditors is to dog-pile on specific problems in other people’s claims. Blockchain is incredible in a narrow field, but people have been digging for uses for it everywhere. In response, people who love to complain and feel superior climb over each other to regurgitate complaints they’ve heard elsewhere about theories that are not working out.

Good explanations of what does work takes a lot of effort to even know about and more to write up. So, that’s a big rarity compared to picking up tomatoes and throwing them again.",g9f2ktx,2020-10-20 18:45:27,2

SenatusSPQR,"Would you ""believe in"" a stablecoin with Nano's characteristics?

The reason I'm asking is that not having it be a stablecoin, or rather not having it pegged to the dollar or euro, is a design choice. A stablecoin has been built on Nano before (Nollar, I believe).

In my opinion making a stablecoin cryptocurrency is a contradictio in terminis. A cryptocurrency does not peg its value to an external, centralised entity. This was one of the ideas behind cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) when Satoshi first released it:

&gt;The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. ([source](http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source))

That's what Nano is. It's trustless, no matter how much the dollar money supply is expanded, Nano's supply will always be at a fixed 133 million, and will therefore over time appreciate versus the dollar.",g9f3570,2020-10-20 18:56:12,1

TheGreatMuffin,"Not to dampen the enthusiasm, but the future is always uncertain and there are a few variables in bitcoin's future that are simply unknown.  

My ""favourite"" argument against bitcoin f.ex is that we simply don't know if on-chain activity will be enough to incentivize mining after declining block subsidy (newly mined bitcoin). This is a question that will be answered after the next 2-3 halvings (so within the next decade or two), and we cannot yet know what the answer will be.  

There are also always non-zero probabilities of bugs and unknown exploits (however low), upcoming contentious ""fork wars"" similar to blocksizes debates but on much larger scale, with much larger actors, f.ex on topic of privacy; none of the institutional investors will want too much on-chain privacy, because this means it's more difficult to regulate. This is in opposition to most of ""regular folk"" who  would desire a higher level of on-chain privacy.

ethlongmusk,"Challenging resistance takes fuel, and while there's definitely outside interest acquiring bitcoin, some of that fuel is inevitably going to come from other crypto.  If it succeeds in propelling BTC to new higher numbers that bring more attention, and takes things even higher we'll find both those who rotated out of other coins rotating back, and new money looking for alternatives.  Until ETH and Ethereum 2.0 become the now household name that bitcoin currently is, the bitcorn will almost always lead any new injections of capital.  Hopefully those days are drawing to an end, but I'm still happy to be dragged upwards even if it is by the old man for the time being.  Plus, as is mentioned in previous posts, diversification definitely helps temper the sour grape whine on days like today.  Bitcoin's success is still ultimately a big part of crypto's success for now.",g9fqgjq,2020-10-20 23:42:11,2

Solfax,"&gt; Out of over 86,000 blockchain projects that had been launched, 92% had been abandoned by the end of 2017 

Seems a bit premature to judge the overall health of blockchain as a viable product using 2017. Outside of Bitcoin, there was not much talk at all of blockchain prior to 2017. That was the year that many projects came into being, most of which proposing an entirely new idea of how Blockchain can work. Also, I am surprised to the point of skepticism at that 86,000 figure. Is 80,000 of that just an companies employee saying ""blockchain is kind of cool"", and then counting it as a project? Regardless, with 92% of 86,000 failing, that still leaves 6880 projects which were not abandoned. This has and always will be a winner take most market. Theres no need for 6,880 blockchains, let alone 86,000.

LargeSnorlax,"Fun /r/cryptocurrency fact: On the day that Bitcoin hit its highest point ever, the [daily discussion thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7k5hc3/daily_general_discussion_december_16_2017/) barely had over 1,000 comments the next day.

It wasn't until later on in December that threads started getting 3k+ comments a day, and only in January did they start really ramping up, getting over 5k+-8k comments a day, with the largest comment count of all time being [on January 8th, 2018](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7owmot/daily_general_discussion_january_8_2018/) with over 14k comments.

From there, obviously, disbelief and sadness took over, leading to a general decline in comments. 

I just find it interesting that on probably the most momentous day in Bitcoin price history, where it almost touched 20k, so few people cared about it. Even then, it was a *huge* jump in comments from even a few months earlier.

The [most commented on thread in September 2017](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7112s7/daily_general_discussion_september_19_2017/?sort=confidence) had a measily 110 comments in it. And that's the highest in the whole month.

Tattered_Colours,"New development:

I called back about my support case, and they agreed to waive the ""bonus"" rollover thing. There are only four methods of payout: LiteCoin, BitCoin, BitCoin Cash, and Bank Wire. [The cryptocurrency payout methods simply have you put in the amount to pay out, your wallet address, and comments](https://i.imgur.com/EJSPppG.png), but I don't have any cryptocurrency wallets.

The [Bank Wire option](https://i.imgur.com/SWY0F8n.png), however, is absolutely where I'm drawing the line. Not only does it require you to give them your SSN for some reason, but apparently the fee for this payout method is **$45**. If you didn't know, these betting pools cap out your wager at whatever would result in $50 of winnings should you win. So to recap, if you give BetUS...

* Enough money to earn $50-worth of winnings [in my case, ~$70]
* A picture of the front of your ID
* Pictures of the front and back of your bank card
* Your name, address, birthday, *bank information*, ***and SSN***...

You earn $5. Maybe.

If there are any future developments in terms of identity theft or fraudulent use of my card information, I will post them in reply to this comment and so on.

Like I get that CB has been listing basically anything with a pulse these days, but listing WBTC is I think huge. Simply it really speaks to institutions realizing that bitcoin on Ethereum is more useful than bitcoin itself. It’s like an escalator - that is its a force multiplier, unless you don’t walk while on an escalator in which case get to the right and... why.... why would you just stand there... go... even one or two steps... whyyyyyy??? Anyhow. This idea of Ethereum as a force multiplier can be applied to the tokenization of many many other assets that already exist. Yes your traditional financial assets but any real world asset.

In other words, if Rootstock were to become as useful as Ethereum, it would have the same fee/congestion problems. Low fees in this instance are a symptom of nobody finding it worthwhile to transact.",g9st7ml,2020-10-24 06:12:31,5

Do you have any debt? Are psychologically and financially ok to lose any money you've invested into bitcoin? Are you familiar with proper bitcoin storage?

elsamster,"I find it bizarre how nobody is talking about the macroeconomic backdrop environment that we are currently in. One of the biggest bull cases for bitcoin right now in my opinion is the fact that it has money properties and its something that the federal reserve cannot print.

All macroeconomists agree that the federal reserve is going to continue to print money indefinitely and will eventually start doing UBI. This will devalue the dollars that you and companies are holding. If you believe that there already hasn't been any inflation because the CPI hasn't moved much, you need to looking into the effect quantitative easing has on assets and look at the asset inflation which has happened. Bitcoin is an asset that is already being added to company's treasuries to preserve their buying power. Also, as bonds stop yielding any positive real rate, this pushes money out of bonds and into risk assets, which could be bitcoin.

Bitcoin is a store of value. Its already a 200Billion dollar market cap, do people just expect it one day to go to zero?

Also no one in here is talking about what is going on all over the world. Bitcoin growth rate has been skyrocketing in countries like Nigeria, Belarus, Iran, Venezuela, Lebanon and tons more where they're currency is inflating away, they're under oppressive regimes, and need somewhere to store money.

Bitcoin allows people to bypass traditional banking systems and send money to/out of countries where it was not possible to do so before.

Bitcoin is a network which gains value from the number of users that are on its platform, similar to facebook. Its the most secure network in the world and it continues to get stronger daily.

Frogolocalypse,"On October 23 2016, bitcoin had a surge in price which pushed it over USD$600.  What people didn't know at the time was that this was the last time that bitcoin ever went below that threshold.

On October 22 2020, bitcoin had a surge which pushed it above USD$12K.  This constitutes a 20x difference between the two dates four years apart, or just over a doubling every year (2^4 = 16).  If the same were to occur (which of course it won't) in late October 2024, we would see bitcoin at USD$240K after having topped out at about USD$350K, and having experienced a trough down to about USD$80K.

Frogolocalypse,"If the same were to occur (which of course it won't) in late October 2028, we would see bitcoin at about USD$4M.  Personally I don't see the top-out being quite so pronounced because the amount of capital needed to push to such extremes will be controlled by non-retail investors, but I've no reason to expect the non-frothy numbers won't be in the ball-park.

Whether it is $1M, $2M or $4M kind of starts being irrelevant.  At about that time, the relevance of non-bitcoin comparisons start to break down, because it would be assumed that this would be the point at which it is starting to be used as a state reserve asset.  The next phase (now to +4yrs) should be driven by corporate take-up, and especially to facilitate trade.  After what trump as done to america, there aren't going to be too many people trusting american institutions like they may have done in the past.  That's inevitably going to lead to countries diversifying away from USD assets.  Bitcoin doesn't even need to be THE choice to diversify, it only needs to be one of them.

Financecorpstrategy4,"I don’t. 

At best, it’s a commodity, not an investment and not a currency . There’s some decent arguements that it can be used as a hedge against inflation. The claim it’s a negatively correlated asset is wrong - it rises and falls with the stock market, when you’d expect the opposite.

I think it’ll be like beanie babies and eventually people will get bored of it and it slowly loses value. I could be wrong though. Unlike a real investment, it’s value is purely based on the greater fool fallacy, and as long as people think it’s worth something and want to buy it, it’ll keep going up.

Bitcoin is already archaic technology, so if cryptocurrencies are actually used as a currency instead of speculation, bitcoin won’t be what people use. In addition, currencies are only useful when values are relatively stable. Imagine if USD could increase or decrease 50-100% per year?

More short-term, we are in a very TINA (there is no alternative) market right now...people have a bunch of cash, but you can’t invest in bonds because of Fed distortion, can’t invest in equities because of high P/E ratios, can’t stay in cash/treasuries because of inflation risk and 0% fed rate....so people are just throwing money everywhere - bitcoins, tech stocks, baseball cards, magic cards, art work, etc...which are all increasing value at a fast rate.

This is why bitcoin climbs stairs early in a bull market but before mania kicks in.

Bitcoin stored by someone else is not under your control. Due to the nature of cryptocurrency, this represents a high risk. Taking control of your coins by controlling the keys has its own risks of course, mostly risk related to inexperience and ""operator error"". Unlike third party custody risks, however, you can overcome the risks of storing your own bitcoin by acquiring knowledge and practical skills. 

If you are technical enough, you should try and store your bitcoin on your own wallet, preferably a hardware wallet.

ngnultimate,"Interesting to note that it appears that the AUDL as a league has raised total cash of $5.96 million since 2013 and currently has only $242k cash on-hand, which suggests that **the League (does not include individual franchises) has on average burned $817,000 per year of operation.**

Additionally, they have $376k coming due in short-term debts and an additional $863k in long-term debts and equity obligations.

I imagine most owners are also carrying their own less than enjoyable burn rate, but even if they aren't the moment the media spending dries up with the League they're going to be out to pasture.

Also worth noting that the Lloyd's own 34.1% of the league out right and then some portion (of which is seems likely to be a majority) of the 53% represented by two investment groups put together by Rob Lloyd.

Better to consider this a donation than an investment. Ten years ago I wrote a business plan for a league and figured best case scenario that some level of break-even sustainability could come when attendance averaged 2,000 paying fans per game. Additionally at that time, after extensive research in business publications, legal documents and trade magazine (not random Internet pundits) the consensus was that in the unlikely event that a sports league doesn't fold that actual profitability does not occur until a league acquires sports specific venues.

The truth of the matter is that the growth in ultimate over the past 10 years has NOT been explosive as many of us had hoped it would be back then. It has been solid growing at (what I'm going to say with absolutely no evidence to back it up) respectable single digit rates. But single-digit returns do not a growth opportunity make.

The AUDL was always a pipe dream and a money burner. If you have some to burn and love frisbee go for it, but if you want to speculate you're more likely better off with a few satoshis of bitcoin and if you really want to invest may I recommend a long-term holding of any of the excellent S&amp;P500 index funds.",ga6m0ck,2020-10-27 02:02:00,7

If the sender is like you, new to Bitcoin Core (BTC), then they likely did not know about the difficulties in sending a transaction on that bitcoin chain. Likely did set the transaction up as an RBF transaction or used a disingenuous transaction type.

As some others have mentioned... you should have used BCH instead. You would have likley not have had this bad of an experience.",ga77yl8,2020-10-27 04:59:16,5

MobTwo,"Ever since Bitcoin had an upgrade into Bitcoin Cash on 1st August 2017, I have been bullish for Bitcoin Cash’s long term future. As follows are my personal opinions on why I feel Bitcoin Cash is the future of digital cash over the outdated BTC.

&amp;nbsp;

**Better Security** – BTC has a vulnerability called RBF which increases the risk of double spending. Bitcoin Cash developers aim to make 0-confirmation transactions safe again so that anyone accepting Bitcoin Cash is much safer accepting payments without having to wait for multiple confirmations. This RBF security vulnerability exists only in BTC and not Bitcoin Cash. That's why Bitcoin Cash is more secure as a payment method.

Here is an example of hackers stolen $150000 worth of BTC using the RBF security vulnerability. https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/03/14/double-spenders-scam-150000-bitcoin/

It is super easy to double spend on Bitcoin using the RBF vulnerability. Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/video-shows-how-easy-it-is-to-double-spend-btc-using-rbf/

&amp;nbsp;

**Improved Scalability** – BTC is limited to 1MB block size and even with Segwit activated, the capacity increase is only around 1.7x whereas the upgraded Bitcoin Cash blocks capacity is currently at 32x with no limitations. This means Bitcoin Cash can handle PayPal transactions volume today and be global money after a few more upgrades.

&amp;nbsp;

**Supply Scarcity** – During the fork from Bitcoin, some Bitcoin Cash supply were removed from active circulation due to users unable to claim their Bitcoin Cash from unsupported exchanges and wallets among other reasons. This means each Bitcoin Cash is actually more scarce than BTC.

&amp;nbsp;

**Improved Confirmation Times** – Due to the limited block size of BTC, some users were made to wait days for their transactions to be confirmed. Contrast this to Bitcoin Cash where transactions may be accepted immediately with less risk and you can see why it makes sense to use Bitcoin Cash. In other words, if you are a shop owner and you just sold a cup of coffee and some sandwiches, and you accept the old BTC, you may have to wait hours for the transaction to be confirmed because the customer may use RBF to void the original payment. With Bitcoin Cash, your risk is minimized.

&amp;nbsp;

**Higher Merchants Adoption** - Bitcoin Cash is global money with more than 2,651,820 merchants accepting it. You can pay for your hotels, air tickets, food/drinks, groceries, nightlife, and more with Bitcoin Cash today. Source: https://1bch.com/?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame

While Bitcoin Cash adoption is growing very quickly every single day, Bitcoin is having declining adoption and if this trend continues then Bitcoin is on a dead end. Source: https://np.reddit.com/r/NotAcceptingBitcoin/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all

&amp;nbsp;

**Low Fees** – One of the advantages of using cryptocurrencies over traditional payment methods is the low fees. Due to the limited block size of BTC, fees have exceeded over $70/transaction during peak period. On the other hand, I have never paid more than 1 penny/transaction during my entire time in using Bitcoin Cash. This makes using Bitcoin Cash ideal for merchants, businesses, companies and everyday usage. The industries that may be disrupted such as Remittances, Payment Gateways, etc are worth trillions of dollars and Bitcoin Cash is well positioned for use cases in these industries.

&amp;nbsp;

**Lightning Network Problems And Vulnerabilities And Loss Funds** - Some people may claim Lightning Network will solve Bitcoin problems but it has failed to gain traction due to many problems and vulnerabilities, such as loss of funds, unreliable transactions (constantly failing), and many other vulnerabilities.

Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/researchers-scathing-lightning-network-analysis-finds-flaws/

&amp;nbsp;

**Tokens** - Bitcoin Cash has tokens to start taking some marketshare from Ethereum. Today, anyone can issue their own loyalty tokens or digital money on Bitcoin Cash from as low as 1 cent to mint it. It's incredibly easy and anyone can do it at https://mint.bitcoin.com/

&amp;nbsp;

**Better Privacy** - Bitcoin Cash has better privacy than BTC thanks to CashShuffle/CashFusion. You can enable it through the setting in the Electron Cash wallet and it's completely optional. If you don't want others to know how you spent your money, it is better to use Bitcoin Cash over BTC.

&amp;nbsp;

**Better Risk/Reward** - If BTC gains another 250 billion marketcap, it only 2x in price. But that same 250 billion will give you more than 50x your Bitcoin Cash investments. It is such a smarter option given the risk/rewards probabilities.

&amp;nbsp;

At the moment, the old BTC has network effects advantages just like how Friendster used to dominate the social networking space. It is inevitable that Bitcoin Cash will overtake BTC's marketcap in the end.",ga7f49p,2020-10-27 05:59:03,6

That's arguably more important than the USD value, long-term. I can see non ETH people thinking that there's more risk with ETH 2 than there actually is in reality (their overpricing the risk). This is partially from both lack of information/understanding and also Bitcoin/other crypto bias. At a macro level, Ethereum looks so good, that everything else pales in comparison. Ethereum IS crypto at this moment in time. That will change in the future, but I find that generalization to be mostly true today. Anytime I see a new dapp launching, I go straight to their whitepaper, and a vast vast majority of the time it's using Ethereum. I think phase 0 is generally low risk, and that by spring of next year, everyone will have moved on and phase 0 will have launched without a hitch. If that's the case, then a low ETH/BTC ratio is a great time to enter, especially if Bitcoin decides to go on a bull run short term",ga7kcvo,2020-10-27 06:44:03,9

The base protocol of Nano is complete and has been solidified for years. This is all the Nano foundation set out to do, build a working protocol and then let the community build the ecosystem. The Nano foundation could walkway at this point and Nano would be completely self sustaining just like Bitcoin was when Satoshi walked away from it.

As long as you are not using vulgarity or threatening or spamming, you can openly debate scaling topics or any other Bitcoin topics on this sub.

This is not at all true with respec to r/bitcoin.  That sub is heavily censored.  Up until less than a year ago I barely came on reddit at all, and I was impartial in the whole BTC vs BCH debate.  I own both.  Fine with staying out of the politics of it all.  Then on r/bitcoin there was one of those posts (I later figured out was probably fake anyway) about a user supposedly getting ""tricked"" by bitcoin.com, and it came down to the user having sent BCH to a Segwit wallet address.  I had the audacity to point out that it was user error, and for that single comment I was immediately, and ***permanently*** banned from r/bitcoin by MrRGnome.  In case you're thinking I'm BS-ing you, feel free to go back and look at my post history prior to that incident.  I don't use reddit much; never did.

**Better Risk/Reward** - If BTC gains another 250 billion marketcap, it only 2x in price. But that same 250 billion will give you more than 50x your Bitcoin Cash investments. It is such a smarter option given the risk/rewards probabilities.

This could still drop, and I honestly should wait for a little before making any decisions, but 13k is looking mighty strong.

Edit: To add a bit more to this - the reason we could be seeing such strength from BTC is from the most basic of fundamentals, supply vs demand. I don't know if demand has increased that dramatically but I think supply is dwindling fast.

People are shorting bitcoin since traditional markets are going down, hence the negative funding rate and the massive decrease to future premiums. But bitcoin isn't a company. There's nothing to sell, dividends to pay, or customers to make happy. Simple supply and demand dictate everything, and anyone who is currently buying bitcoin is probably just locking it away for at least a year. And when supply is gone, the price moves higher.

I'm still expecting a drop of at least 20% sometime in the near future, but it is looking less likely that it will happen at this price point.

saintyoo,"Answer:

Short answer is that new video cards come out all of the time. Just looking at NVIDIA (who currently has the most market share) here are the release dates.



Series | Year
---|---
500|2010
600 | 2012
700 | 2013
900 | 2014
1000 | 2016
2000 | 2018
3000 |2020

The long answer to why it seems like you are just hearing about things now.

* The 2000 series introduced real time ray tracing in video games, which was a cool new technology introduced to consumer level products (technologies like this only come every decade or so). However the 2000 series was actually controversial because of a few reasons.

&gt; 1. Rasterization performance (the standard way to render game scenes when not ray tracing) was not markedly better than the 1000 series (single digit % performance increases but in some cases it even performed worse). 

&gt; 2. Ray tracing is computationally expensive, turning it on would mean that performance in terms of frames per second would be significantly worse. In fact many games use both rasterization and ray tracing so they don't have to do full ray tracing to save performance.

&gt; 3. No games actually had ray tracing available for about 4-6 months after the release of the video cards. You paid for features you couldn't even use until later.

&gt; 4. They were very expensive. Many people who had the 900 or 1000 series did not want to pay for expensive video cards (the bitcoin mining craze also hit video card prices and availability hard right before the 2000 series launched).

* The 3000 cards just released and actually had a big performance gain over the 2000 series in terms of both rasterization and ray tracing performance at a more affordable price (NVIDIA claimed that the 3070 at $500 could outperform the 2080 TI at $1000+). In addition NVIDIA has been working on DLSS 2.0, a AI upscaling technology that makes ray tracing and playing games at high (4k+) resolutions more viable.

* AMD (the second biggest video card maker) has been trailing in terms of market share for a while. However today they had a press event that had claims that they would match the performance of NVIDIA cards at competitive prices up and down the entire product stack. It's something they haven't managed to do in a while.

* New consoles are coming out this year so people have been keeping an eye on what kind of new graphics tech will be included.

So with the controversial 2000 series with new tech, the major performance gains of the 3000 series, AMD possibly making a comeback and new consoles, people/media are talking.",gag860i,2020-10-29 11:10:31,11

JuanChaleco,"In general:
The progressive people tries to integrate them and treat them as chileans and just another person. The more conservatives go through the logic of ""charity starts at home"" and go full racist in some cases.

The objective view probably is that we are a small country that is/was not prepared to integrate them economically, and that has generated a lot of pain points, lowering already low wages and making entry jobs hard to get, Haitians will work forever for as little as nothing, Peruvians will accept working  in conditions chileans just won't, and venezuelans come taking janitorial, as 
house service or gardeners with law degrees or engineering titles. But the truth is that they didn't do it. The laws were soft and ""job creators"" just went full sweat shop on everybody. Is a meme were we saw mechanics and supermarkets full of peruvians one day and now full of haitians the next day. And it doesn't help, Black people speaking creole in already crowded busses and metro or in already unsecure perceived places full of unknown people speaking a ""weird kind of french"" or Venezuelans offering professional services for the smallest of fees that you can pay on bitcoin in job markets were you used to be able to maintain yourself, all in the downtime of their ubereats job.

At the end chileans are warm with the ones we know, from every side, even the most upper class segregated family will have a peruvian acquaintance from chimbote who told him about how real corruption is in other places, or a Venezuelan girl with a law degree serving you a cheese sandwitch, called in the least common name in chilean ""civil registry"", will talk about how things are unsafe were she lives, but no were near how it was in Barquisimento where she saw a guy killed with machetes ""because beer and 5 bucks owed or something like that"". The Chilean person will help both and consider them the same as any other person.

The problem in Chile is not really racism (not generalized at least and not by it self) the problem is Classism and snubness. If you are poor and i don't know you, unless you are a gringo, from europe or ""white asian""... you are ""dangerous"" or ""potentially dangerous"".",gagfj6o,2020-10-29 12:24:23,16
nodecache,"Right now, amidst a lot of chaos and concern and a thousand reasons to feel bad and after years of feeling either numb or nonchalant, I feel exhilarated.  Not bullish or bearish, but fascinated by what's unfolding.  4 years ago today I stopped researching and wondering and started playing with pocket change.  I saw prices go up, ratios fluctuate but I had no idea what was happening from a historical perspective and it took many months for me to understand the intercrypto waves I was riding.  I honestly thought the growth potential was probably played out, thus the mere pocket change (oh how I kick myself now).  

Today I know where we're at and what it means.  The significance of it.  I'm not sure that we can make history again, much less that it will be soon, but history is well within our grasp.  There have been so many milestones since the 2018 bust, charting this path.  But everything up to now -- finding a bottom, the recovery, the halvings, the infrastructure, the institutions, the big names and all the headlines -- was just development and dress rehearsal.  Now it's time for the show.  The curtain is rising.  Snarky reviewers are watching for something to pounce on.  Audiences are waiting with bated breath.  

Litecoin did its part in 2019 workshopping and has settled into understudy status (where I suspect it will remain until Act 3).  Everything rests on Bitcoin.  Act I requires Bitcoin to close a monthly candle above $14k and then not invalidate it by closing another below, which confirms a double bottom (Dec 2018, March 2020) with a target of... $24k.  Then for Act II Bitcoin on the way to that target encounters the $19k ATH.  In 2017, BTC wrestled around the $1k ATH for 3 months, peeking above and diving below over and over like a cheeky dolphin goofing off.  No one knows if Bitcoin can breakout past $19k much less how long it will take.  If it does, then on to Act III, wherein Bitcoin will attempt to take an mcap somewhere between $2.5 trillion and $10 trillion, possibly even rivaling the mcap of gold (briefly, if it gets that far), during which time should Act 3 occur, Litecoin will take the stage to attempt a $100 to $300 billion mcap all its own to rival bitcoin's 2017 mcap.

Anytime you decide to cash some out, just remember that your helping to increase adoption and ultimately a higher value. Satoshi would love this post guaranteed.",gak5vt9,2020-10-30 11:02:57,18
ElephantGlue,"Based off your previous post it seems like you’ve already made up your mind about lightning. After reading the Twitter post in your stealth edit he even mentions it’s a thought experiment for if the mempool never clears. That’s a highly improbable contrived situation.

So if you think it makes sense that your $20 lunch at the Cheesecake Factory deserves to be permanently imbued into the worlds most valuable decentralized database, go and sell it all.

Although, if I were you I’d take a second stab at coming to terms with what the ultimate value of the base layer really holds for the future of humanity.

JonathanSilverblood,"There is currently very high demand for transactions on the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain, and the network does not have capacity to handle this amount of demand.

As a result, users are overbidding eachother in order to get their transactions processed, by paying higher miner fees.

Eventually, the demand might slow down and fees might becomes bearable again, but it's not possible to accurately predict when.

For the future, if you need a chain that is built for scalability that doesn't have this problem, you could test and see if Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fits your needs instead.",gamdaxi,2020-10-31 02:44:42,6

This isn't decentralization or anything, but honestly I'd say it's about time. I'm surprised they didn't do it sooner. Bitcoin is probably the only asset I'd want to see a robust, decentralized, trustless bridge built for. For the rest of them (and the limited purposes you'd want to use them for), I think this is sufficient.

imagineacoolnickname,"CDC in a nutshell... I was very excited about the company and their services but now I lose daily more and more faith in them and it all started with that swap fiasco, continued to curve debacle, dropped interest rates, changed cashback policy where you dont get cashback for ALL your spending but rather a portion of it and the latest increase for card staking which means that CDC does not think the coin will rise in price (which was at an ATH during the convenient swap).

They are saying they have 5 million users but who cares about the number of users when that just means registered on app. I wonder how many of them will use the app or any service after all the poor and non communicated decisions they made.

A bad word of mouth travels faster then any paid advert or remaining perks that the card hold since those perks are also diminishing in value with every dropping cent of the CRO coin, thats all that I can say.

Like Kris said. CRO will never replace MCO and the last time, go buy some bitcoin :)",gamymi1,2020-10-31 05:45:17,14
