fp46asu,MusaTheRedGuard,16,"lol it's pretty funny to realize that all of us who've been here through the bear market have been vindicated as correct.


ETH is money. That statement seems so obvious now, like saying the sky is blue. It wasn't so obvious a few years ago.


ETH is pushing this industry forward. Again, obvious. 


But multiple VCs and funds decided to fund ETH killers and [""the bitcoin stack""(lol)](https://medium.com/blockchain-capital-blog/lightning-is-only-the-beginning-the-emerging-bitcoin-stack-fb6d4aefb664), almost all of which have failed(or are failing) spectacularly. 


Remember dfinity? lol. Wasn't polkadot supposed to launch in late 2019? lol.


People used to shit on apps like compound or makerdao or ens, now they are solid infrastructure for this entire industry. 


Facebook straight up copied the entire makerdao model for its stablecoin lol. Tron copy pasted uniswap. And a bunch of other apps. New blockchains launch saying that ""ETH is too slow for Defi""(lol) when Defi as we know it emerged on and because of Ethereum. Bitcoiners are saying BTC is also defi(lmao).


No matter what the price does, I just want to say: we were right. and tbh, i'll take that over moon",2020-05-01 09:22:26
fp3du4g,Kuli24,15,"Someone told me they lost their paper wallet... which had about $70,000 in bitcoin on it.  They turned their house upside down and never found it.  So hopefully that sad story makes you feel a little better?",2020-05-01 05:12:56
fp483e3,rebro1,14,"I still don't get people being happy when ETH prices in fiat ($) are going up and they don't care about the ratio going down. Yeah, I know people see $ only, especially the newbies who entered the crypto market in the past 2 years. BUT, do you even realize that it's better to HODL Bitcoin in a Bitcoin upwards moments than Ethereum if your goal is to make more fiat ($) money? Percentage wise you get more fiat. So, consider ratio when trading, don't blindly follow fiat ($).

Do you realize that big players, whales, mostly early adopters with shitload of coins are moving markets with ""ratios"" (altcoin/BTC)? And don't start with ""bhut bhut, exchange fiat volume braahh"" - fake and gay. And they move all markets together in sync. There is no real global crypto FOMO. Like the stock market, crypto market is also rigged and manipulated, but more volatile. They can make huge price swings up and down with little or no new money inflow to the market itself, just to fake market activity (wash trading is still a thing in crypto). And huge price swings are often made on purpose to rekt overleveraged newbies (short or long, doesn't matter, it will wick up and down in a matter of a second, *paaaf*, say goodbye to your wife).

**Want to make real money long term?**

- Trade in ratio pairs (ALT/BTC): We are somehow/somewhat at the bottom of this crypto cycle, looking at the previous ATHs and ATLs. There is much more gain potential trading ALT/BTC than ALT/fiat or fiat/BTC, I dare to say 10-100x more.
- If you want to trade in fiat, just buy Bitcoin, don't buy alts
- If you buy, don't panic sell when things go a little bit south, we are near or at the bottom but prices can still go down 2x from now, or even 3x (ratio wise), but that's nothing compared to possible 10-100x future gains on ratio. Just fucking HODL
- DO NOT over leverage, as mentioned above, violent swings aka ""flash crashes"" will rekt you, even stop losses won't always save you because **[insert some crypto exchange bug here]**. I wouldn't recommend going over 2x leverage, but I'm no expert
- Don't trade against the trend and don't daily trade. Shorting ALTs now in this market is a receipe for disaster - not a lot of downward potential, but a lot of upgoing potential, leaving you behind with your open short position, rekting you like a boss.
- Do not listen to ""pro traders and whales"" advices on twitter, youtube and other social media. They are just promoting their market positions, they are not future tellers.
- Book orders (support and resistance, buy/sell walls) are fake as **[insert your favourite dirty word here]** and looking at them, even counting on them is futile. Bots are making instant changes based on the strategy market makers make. Buy and sell walls are there to confuse you. In the old days, especially on low volume coins, they just instantly pulled the support (like 80% of the whole book) and rekted the market for **TeH PhuN aNd tEh GiGgLez**.
- Technical analysis, graph charting and all the magic stuff and buzzwords ""pro traders"" use and draw in crypto is a major bullshit. I can draw you a ""jumping cat"" chart and it will be as credible and real as a text book charts and analysis. Market makers are deceiving you, they ""paint"" the charts for you with their lovely bots. They paint what you want to see, it's not ""organic"". It goes the opposite way of what you think is happening.
- Sell when your grandma or your lost redneck friend suddenly calls you and starts talking about crypto and how he is going to become rich overnight. Sell the FOMO, there will be many more bull/bear cycles to take advantage off. People dragged into FOMO are thinking like modern economists who think Earth resources are unlimited and profit will only go up each year, towards infinity. Don't be a modern economist please, be a ""common sense peasant"" instead.
- Coin price on the ticker is not a real value of the coin, it's just the last trade. So your logic of thinking: ""OMFG brooo, jizz in pants, If I had 10.000 Bitcoins I would have {10.000 x last_ticker_price } moneyzz"" is wrong. Why? You shouldn't be trading if you ask that question, just HODL.
- Your long term trading goal should be making as much ETH or BTC as possible, not fiat.

**TL;DR:**

- Trade in ALT/BTC pair, more gainz ahead
- Don't day trade
- Don't over leverage
- Don't ever go against the trend
- Don't panic sell
- Buy when the whole market is near the bottom and HODL for a year, two, three.
- Sell the FOMO
- **Think RATIO not FIAT**",2020-05-01 09:39:40

There will always be ups and downs. The question from day 1 has always been ""can this actually work?"" Therefore the more time that elapses and more adversity it overcomes in terms of jarring price fluctuations, the closer it inches towards that answer being ""yes"".

fp34qpi,gotamd,9,"This is not a bug in the code.  This is a fundamental issue with the design of LN.  Based on [this article](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2020/04/29/), the preferred solution to the problem will clog the main chain even more and therefore hurt the usability and trustlessness of BTC and LN further:

&gt; **Settlement transaction anchor outputs:** Onchain settlement transactions could be redesigned to spend their value to anchor outputs that could be CPFP fee bumped using CPFP carve-out. This would require those transactions to be larger (increasing onchain fees) and presigned (reducing flexibility). This would only directly affect channels which are unilaterally closed while payments are pending, which is already a situation that can significantly increase onchain costs and so is something users try to avoid. However, raising the cost of onchain enforcement also raises the minimum practical value of payments that can be sent trustlessly through LN. Despite these challenges, as of this writing, this appears to be the most preferred solution.

Another workaround to this problem would be to--wait for it--raise the blocksize cap.

And regarding the content, anyone arguing it's better to be in BTC when the ratio is terrible like it is now is full of shit. ETH has almost been at parity with Bitcoin before, historically speaking the ratio isn't going to have much more upside potential than it does right now. It could drop some 20-35% from here in anticipation of the halvening sure, but the upside potential is like 500% if not more.

fp7e0sx,yojoots,7,"The article makes the case that the respective dominant narratives for Bitcoin and Ethereum have evolved over time (for BTC, from ""digital cash"" to ""digital gold"" and for ETH, from ""payment for computation"" to ""DeFi backing asset""). This is somewhat misleading, though, in that Bitcoin's core value proposition has always been as a digital gold-like asset; the original whitepaper mentions that Bitcoin mining and issuance was modeled after gold mining, Satoshi [called Bitcoin an implementation of Szabo's Bitgold proposal](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=342.msg4508#msg4508), described Bitcoin as [a digital analogue to gold](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=583.msg11405#msg11405) on multiple occasions, and even in the very earliest days, [pitched Bitcoin as a type of precious metal in digital form](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/p2pfoundation/threads/1/#7). In other words, from the beginning, Bitcoin has been designed (and marketed) as digital gold. Incidentally, for what it's worth, this isn't at odds with it being e-cash; the concept of e-cash is actually surprisingly old and historically speaking it basically means a cryptographically authenticated, practically private bearer instrument. In other words, *most* cryptocurrency qualifies as e-cash on etymological grounds, and Bitcoin is certainly no exception.

The reason I point all of this out is because the idea that ""Bitcoin was originally supposed to be digital cash but then pivoted to be digital gold"" seems to be a misunderstanding of remarkable prevalence, and unfortunately this is often weaponized by Bitcoin's detractors, and spun in the manner of ""Bitcoin lost its way,"" which in light of the above, is very far off-the-mark.

It's more enlightening to **contrast** Ethereum against Bitcoin in this respect, then, because it is certainly true that Ethereum's dominant narrative(s) have radically evolved over time, from computation-payments to fundraising-platform to decentralized-finance-backbone. This makes sense; the Ethereum mantra has been to [""move fast and break things""](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/01what-is.asciidoc#ethereums-development-culture) since inception, and this has always been one of the core differentiators of the project from Bitcoin's much-more-conservative ethos. As [I've said before](https://twitter.com/yojoots/status/1191770542875054081?s=19):

&gt;Ethereum, as a more generalized project, has a community looking for purpose and promise wherever it might be found. Bitcoin is hyper-focused and specialized, and the community fixates instead on protecting that idealized kernel of inviolability at layer-1 as much as possible.

In other words, we should *expect* the dominant Ethereum narrative to change, evolve, and pivot more than the dominant Bitcoin narrative, considering the priorities and emphases of each project and their respective communities. And indeed, that's exactly what we've seen so far.",2020-05-02 06:34:24

fpavjtj,UsernameIWontRegret,1,"&gt; If PoS would be better, then bitcoins would start with it.

This is flawed reasoning. You're making the assumption that Bitcoin is perfect and that tech doesn't evolve. Let me rephrase it this way. If electric engines would be better for cars then cars would have started with them. That's the same logic you're using. 

&gt;Why would PoS be good? It would lead to more centralization 

It's actually the exact opposite. PoS lowers the barriers to entry, and assures that the people running the network are the actual users of the network. Bitcoin isn't nearly as decentralized as you think. In fact it keeps getting more and more centralized with every halving. With each halving the profitability of miners does down due to less rewards.

fpds7y3,networking_noob,3,"Nice snarky remark in a subreddit for beginner questions.

I do understand supply and demand. But what happens when miner incentive is taken away (BTC rewards are gone). Fewer miners will stick around just to verify transactions. Which means transaction verification times will be longer, especially if even a fraction of the world's population adopts Bitcoin.

Longer verification times means users will be pissed, especially if the only remedy is paying a large expedited processing fee. Users will stop using Bitcoin for purchases aka there won't be demand, and Bitcoin's value plummets.

fpetwbp,DamonAndTheSea,3,"So I [posted this chart a month ago](https://www.tradingview.com/x/LQribfGm/)... this is simple analysis but it's something I'm still siting with.  We've seen a classic V shaped recovery from the lows with price retracing the entire dump and with the largest volume signature in Coinbase history.  This signals to me that the low is in... it's rare we see this kind of signature and generally they're bankable in the long term.

Traditional market weakness and uncertainty about the pandemic still gives me trepidation.  I don't think I'm alone in this feeling despite the recent bounce... it seems like the sane majority sentiment right now is ""Yes price has recovered but we're gonna tank again eventually once equities get a reality check"".  What do you guys think?  How are global circumstances going to affect the crypto markets?

I'm in a 'hodl' position with Bitcoin and have been recently interested in alts given the multi year consolidation phase around the lows (unpopular opinion I think) ... but I really don't know what's going to happen.  The contrarian part of me thinks that this down market in crypto is providing cheap and opportunistic prices when compared against cash and traditional markets which are beginning to look fragile in the current climate.  My practical intuition says crypto is still a bitch to traditional markets and isn't yet mature enough to follow it's own unique price timeline.  

If price manages to push above $10k and hold, my ambivalence will change to bullishness.. until then I'm feeling unclear.

fpif0ni,nullc,12,"I've been beta testing this the last few weeks. The software is still pretty new but it's great.

One of the exciting new technical features in it is that it has an alternative serialization of Bitcoin transactions which is more bandwidth efficient.  Any bitcoin transaction can be losslessly converted, one transaction at a time, into this alternative serialization and applied across the whole Bitcoin history it reduces transaction sizes by about 25%.

It saves a little more on older blocks, in part because their transactions have a lot more uncompressed pubkeys and compressing pubkeys is one of the things it does to shrink transactions. Newer blocks are more like 20% smaller using this serialization.

Similar, but somewhat less reduction in size can be achieved by using standard compression tools like xz or zstd on groups of blocks.  But because the new serialization in blocksat works a single transaction at a time it's compatible with both transaction relay and fibre's-mempool-powered-reconstruction. (if you do want to work whole-block-at-a-time it can also be combined with traditional compression to get a little more savings).

If a Bitcoin nodes were to use this generally, they could drop their on-disk storage requirement for the full block data by about 25%, they could also negotiate using it with supporting peers and lower their bandwidth used for initial sync and transaction relay. Post erlay, this would give a 15% reduction in the total ongoing bandwidth usage of a node (pre-erlay the bandwidth used by INVs would diminish the gains a lot for anything except history sync).

The cool thing about it is that it's not a consensus change: How you store a block locally, or how two consenting peers share transactions data is no one else's business.  This is why blocksat 2.0 can use the new format without anything changing in the rest of the Bitcoin network.  Right now the blocksat software only uses this new serialization over the satellite-- where space savings is also critical--, but using it on disk or with other peers wouldn't be a huge addition.

The downsides of the new serialization is that it's more computationally expensive to decode than the traditional one, and of course the implementation has a bit of complexity. I've been pushing for this [sort of idea since 2016](https://people.xiph.org/~greg/compacted_txn.txt) (note: the design I described in that link is only morally similar, their bitstream is different-- I'd link to docs on it but I don't think there are any yet), so I'm super excited to see it actually implemented!

The history download is pretty neat: Every block is broken into ~1152 byte packets and redundantly coded with 5% + 60 extra packets.  A rolling window of about ~6500 blocks is transmitted in interleave, resulting in about one packet from each block in the window per minute.  With this setup, which can be adjusted on the sending side,  you can take an hour long outage per day or so plus 5% packet loss and not suffer any additional delays in initial sync. If it does lose sync it saves the blocks it completely received--even if it doesn't have their ancestors yet-- and will continue once the history loops back around again. If you have internet access (potentially expensive or unreliable; or maybe even sneaker net!), you could also connect temporarily and just get the chunk of blocks you missed instead of waiting for it to loop around again.

The software was also rebased on 0.19-- their prior stuff had been falling behind a bit.

The satellite signal is doing some neat stuff:  They time division multiple two different bitrate streams  (one about 100kbit/sec like the original blocksat stream, and one about 1mbit/sec) on the same frequency.  The low rate stream can be reliably received with a smaller dish and under worse weather, and only carries new blocks, and transactions.  The high rate stream also carries new blocks and transactions (when they show up), but in addition carries the block history. When new blocks come in the data from both streams contribute to how fast you receive the block.

I believe they're recommending an 80cm dish now, mine are 76cm and the signal on both streams is very strong and robust against poor weather. YMMV based on location and weather conditions. The low rate stream should be reliable on pretty small dishes.

This new high rate stream also significantly reduces the latency for transmitting blocks, making it more realistic to mine using blocksat as your primary block feed (and then using $$$ two-way sat to upload blocks when you find one).  Right now 4 second latencies are typical though there is some opportunity for software running that should get it consistently closer to 1 second.  The updated stream also handles multiple sat feeds more seamlessly-- in some regions you can see two different blocksat feeds, such as in California where I live, and if you have two receivers it'll half the latency to receive blocks (and obviously increase the robustness).

The new setup makes it easier to separate the modem from the bitcoin node.  You can have a modem left closer to the dish(es) connected to ethernet (directly w/ their ethernet attached modems, or w/ a usb modem and a rpi) have it send udp multicast across a network to feed one more receiving bitcoin nodes.  This can help eliminate long annoying coax runs.

Finally, they also preserved the ability to get the stream with a pure SDR receiver *and* added the ability to use an off the shelf USB DVB-S2 modem, and the DVB modems are more flexible in what LNBs you use... so if you're in a location where getting more blocksat specific hardware is inconvenient or might erode your privacy-- they've got you covered.

All in all, I think this is pretty exciting.",2020-05-05 09:46:00

The dump from $225 to $195 was [expected](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/gbcwi9/daily_general_discussion_may_1_2020/fp8o215/).  It was [at the cliff's edge](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/gclrom/daily_general_discussion_may_3_2020/fpew9ar/) but we held.

People are still in disbelief that this is real.  

Terrible place to start a new margin position (keep accumulating instead).  Bitcoin needs to hold the 1hr 100MA.


That having been said, after that pivotal scam/cool off move now we can go higher.  This would happen very soon with the halving one week from right now.  Any drops will be much weaker until then.


Eth however has clearly lost its independent momentum and it's all about grandpa Bitcoin right now.  After the post halving drop (if any), all eyes will be on Eth.

This may be the beginning of the end of Bitcoin unilaterally controlling the market.

Y'all are in my way.  

That is not what I am seeing.  [My outlook](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/gd67fs/daily_general_discussion_may_4_2020/fpin38u/) is different pre-halving.  

I am no magician or some fortuneteller.  I'm not cool enough to use [magical triangles](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/gdsczp/daily_general_discussion_may_5_2020/fpmhqie/).  But I am going to put my thoughts out there as a contrary view.  

The tug of war is indeed grinding the ratio down.  It is Bitcoin's time right now.  200 is now irrelevant and paper thin.  Eth was 216 at this level on the way up.  Now it is slithering around 204.  Any dip in Bitcoin is going to send Eth below 200 due to the ratio.  All this means is that stops should be planned accordingly.  190 is the new 200.  Margin positions that would liquidate at 192 or above are very high risk.

I can't predict what will happen on the day of/day after the halving.  I am not going to try.  There is so little data, it would be silly to try to be firm on anything.  I will just be ready for whatever happens.

As for me, I will be patient.  If I am wrong, so be it.  But this is [why I take profits and wait](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/gc1lnx/daily_general_discussion_may_2_2020/fpals77/) for the right entry.  People were looking back at my [$153 and below longs](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/g0dbc4/daily_general_discussion_april_13_2020/fnbec1v/) and were saying how ""lucky"" I was.  It was really choppy then too.  It is choppy now.  [Just as before at 170](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/g59vps/daily_general_discussion_april_21_2020/fo42dxl/), I'd be sweating bullets shorting here at 204.  

In anycase, my money is where my mouth is and I will pay the price for being wrong. [Still long at 202 and nauseatingly long at 194 on that last breakdown attempt](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/gclrom/daily_general_discussion_may_3_2020/fpew9ar/).

fpm6b47,puff_paff,8,"they are quanto futures (just like the quanto swaps); this means #eth long/short varies whenever bitcoin value changes; this implies additional risk for market makers. One cannot just go ""100 eth spot long + 100 quanto short"" and earn funding because if bitcoin increases 20% your position has become ""100 eth spot long + 120 quanto short."" The size of your position changing might not seem a big deal for retail speculators, but it probably is pretty important for market makers taking on very large position (and need to keep their books in check/neutral)

see also: 

https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/understanding-quanto-risk-and-opportunity/

In the past I tried to run various arbitrage strategies on the quanto swap; it seems the funding on the quanto swap is actually fairly priced at an average of 3.5% per month (or 0.1% per day), this was my average cost of dynamically adjusting my positions, in the end I was running breakeven and I could not outperform the ""easy money funding"" on the ethusd swaps; probably somebody smarter has running some algorithm to price this stuff accurately. 



the ethusd quanto future should have an average premium of 10% per quarter, which seems insane, but is the ""fair price."" My estimate of 10% is because ""long quanto swap at 0.1% average for 90 days"" should equal ""short 10% quanto future premium.""

fplr2bl,bitusher,6,"For the US, if you sell, trade for another asset, or spend it becomes a taxable event. One reason, of many, why day trading is a nightmare. 
**Yes, Every single trade on an exchange is a taxable event!**

Now this has several implications. Day trading becomes tax nightmare because every transaction is a taxable event. So someone that daytrades or invests in altcoins may be forced to use specialized software or hire an accountant for thousands of dollars and someone that just makes an occasional purchase of Bitcoin and withdraws it has a much easier task of calculated any taxes especially if they don't make large purchases giving them an excuse to simply not report. Not the same if you are daytrading on exchanges , especially if you have made over 200 trades in a year.

Also there is a distinction between short term and long term capital gains taxes so its much wiser to not sell your BTC for at least 1 year so at worst you have to pay the much lower long term capital gains -

Look at this chart -

https://www.fool.com/taxes/2020/01/02/capital-gains-tax-rates-in-2020-a-comprehensive-gu.aspx

TL;DR - most people will need to pay 15% in the USA for selling BTC after a year.

**Buy Bitcoin , record the price you bought it for and the date in a spreadsheet and wait at least 1 year before selling it or taking profits so if you do decide to pay taxes on profits you are at least in the lower tax category of long term capital gains.**

Many people do not pay taxes when they spend BTC or sell it in person for cash but if you sell on any exchange like coinbase in the future , buy a car, boat, atv, house , land with Bitcoin , you better pay your taxes

Examples - 

**Example 1 legal**: Say you bought 10 BTC for 1k USD each and want to sell them over a year later. Those BTC are now worth 10k each so you have a realized profit of 90k USD, thus your taxable income is now 90k if you have no other income. This would means you are in the 15% tax bracket thus are subject to 13,500 USD in taxes on the profit - deductions and writeoffs. So lets say with your writeoffs and deductions you now have to pay 6.5k in taxes , leaving you with 83,500 USD to put a down payment on a home.

**Example 2 legal** - You have 10 BTC purchased or mined at 1k each when you received them. This is now worth 100k USD. You wait a year to sell them and never sell more than the amount where your total income exceeds 39,375 usd per year and than file your taxes where you pay none due to being in the first capital gains bracket **if you have no other sources of income as you state** . This will take several years or much longer(as btc continues to appreciate) to slowly sell off your bitcoin


**Example 3 technically illegal**  - You have 10 BTC purchased or mined at 1k each when you received them. This is now worth 100k USD. You decide to use your reported income from your occupation to buy a home and keep the BTC spending separate on other items. You slowly spend your BTC on amazon, plane trips, hotels, selling small amounts in person or in atms without ID , restaurants in a private manner(personal wallet that you control private keys and you have done the minimum to wash the BTC). Technically you need to report taxes on every tx , but since you are not day trading the exchange you bought the BTC from does not report you and it is unenforceable for the IRS to even know you are spending those BTC. Since you are not buying large items registered to your identity you are also not targeted as well.",2020-05-06 07:30:44

- Various drivers I also had to write for Linux for esoteric hardware that nobody supported at the time (this was in the early-to-mid 2000's)

- Matlab native code.  I used C because the people that hired me to do it didn't really know C++.. so I figured I'd leave them with some code they could at least maintain and change going forward.

- Python-&gt;C native code to optimize a few things that were slow.  I could have used C++ for this but -- the Python interop to C is more straightforward and I figured the code itself was easier to undertand by even noobies if C. (Again, it had to remain maintainable by people that weren't necessarily C++ people -- C is more readable in general for people coming from other languages owing to it being a simpler language).

- I got commissioned to take this Bitcoin mining pool software called ""ckpool"" and modernize it and adapt it to Bitcoin Cash.  It's written in C.. so. Yeah.

2. The majority of Nano faucet workers were from countries with weaker economies, so many people were farming the faucet as a day job and immediately selling the received Nano

3. People dumping their Nano immediately improves distribution significantly, because it gets spread to more people. It's the same way Bitcoin's distribution started very top heavy, but has gotten better over time as the market works its magic (e.g. through trade and exchange)

4. The first three years of Bitcoin distribution gave 50 BTC/block, meaning that 50% (**10.5 MILLION**) of all Bitcoin were distributed before 2012. How many people do you know that got into Bitcoin in 2012??

5. The guy you linked with 2,000,000 Nano WAS BUYING THEM: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1437592.msg14543761#msg14543761

7. Scripting a CAPTCHA faucet is not that different from mining Bitcoin with more/better mining hardware. If you put in more effort, you get more reward. 

8. Over the lifetime of the faucet, each hour the faucet was active, a total of 17,000 Nano were distributed among the top 100 claimants. If a user participated in solving CAPTCHAs but was outside the top 100, their claims rolled over until they accumulated enough solves to be rewarded, allowing casual users to engage the faucet at their convenience.",2020-05-06 07:01:26

[This post](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/gdsczp/daily_general_discussion_may_5_2020/fpmhvb4/) was made with Bitcoin/Eth at 8975/204.  Got a lot of love (sarcasm) for the post.  The lovely PMs were great thanks (again sarcasm).  People apparently added to their shorts in spite.  Well within 2 hours the current move up started and now we are back at the top of the original run with bitcoin hitting 9400 again.  Yes Eth is $20 short but that was expected.  Yes this is not going to be a clean freight train up.

This is probably going to be my last post on the market for a while.  I am not interested in petty triangle squabbles.  I don't really care what one indicator is saying.

In any case, I don't think I am proved right yet, but I caution against the heavy negative and dour bias.  You are shorting a coiled spring.  This market has been beaten to death for several years.  The black swan global pandemic drop to the 3000's/90's was a pivot point.

I brought this up [last week](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/ga43kl/daily_general_discussion_april_29_2020/foz8pns/), but I want to restate a few things again simply as a counter to the heavy negative bias.  My position/perspective is built on several factors and I am not going to go through them all, but I see some assumptions being made that I think are incorrect so I will focus on those.

With the insane monetary policy around the world, eyes are on gold and crypto.  This is real. 

GBTC and ETHE are making massive purchases of Bitcoin/Eth and are now even going in the opposite direction of the price of Bitcoin/Eth.

Economies are starting to open up. 

ETH hash rate is up

ETH transactions are up

ETH exchanging hands is up

ETH accumulation is up

ETH number of addresses is up

Exchange activity/accounts are up

Miners are hoarding

BTC halving is coming

EIP 1559 is coming

ETH2 is nearly here

Yes we could wake up to 150 again. Yes FOMO (using money you shouldn't or leverage that is reckless) is bad. But last time we were here, we suddenly showed up at $1400 in ~4 months. That is an increase in $300 a month. An increase of more than the current value

every

month.

It is far too slow, too resource-heavy, too insecure, and too volatile to be useful as a form of exchange for every day commerce.

It was designed to be highly deflationary, which makes it a terrible currency. 

It has no intrinsic value, which makes it useless as a commodity.

It does not contribute to the production of any product or service. There is no form of value creation anywhere in the entire Bitcoin ecosystem, which makes it a worthless investment vehicle.

A lot of people don't understand that the halving is a built in inherent deflationary function of Bitcoin. That's the part that increases the value of Bitcoin. The effects take months and years. After the halving the value of Bitcoin starts to slowly increase with each new Bitcoin mined, while slowly increasing the rate of rarity of Bitcoin.

The historical data typically shows the start of a bull market in the months after the halving day. Which would be typical for an instrument that deflates.

If the halving fomo price was already priced in, we would be at least above 20K by now. There's never been a cycle where the ATH is lower than the previous cycle's.

But if you take a second to look at the history of each halving cycles, you will see that we're not even at that phase yet, the fomo period typically happens around a year later when the market starts to realize the effect of the deflation, and the big masses jump in when things start to look ripe and the headlines are filled with crazy price jumps.

For equally obvious reasons the typical ""money laundering"" doesn't work here as well: Once the first victim (the one with the compromised account) notices that something is wrong he'll have the transfer reversed (this will become important in a sec).

Enter the sugar baby. The scammer uses the compromised account to pay off the CC debt, usually by attaching the account to the CC. This seems to work great, and now for a variety of reasons (personal emergency, gift for a different sugar baby, show of gratitude...) the scammer needs the sugar baby to send him gift card codes (or buy Bitcoin). The sugar baby does so and hence supplies the scammer with a non-traceable quasi-currency. Next thing is of course that the first victim notices something is wrong with his account and consequently reverses the transfer. Sugar baby has the old CC debt back plus the money she sent to the scammer (and possibly an investigation into the whole situation).

&gt; * Nobody ever created money out of nothing (except for mimers, and only according to a well-defined schedule).  
&gt; 
&gt; * Nobody ever spent coins without holder their private key.  
&gt; 
&gt; * Nobody spent the same coins twice (but see further).  
&gt; 
&gt; * Nobody violated any of the other tricky rules that are needed to keep the system in check (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, ...).  
&gt; 
&gt; ... with one exception: because there is a need to pick a winner in presence of multiple competing valid versions of the ledger, (a majority of) miners have the authority to pick the version of the block chain that wins. This means their power is limited to choosing the order in which otherwise valid transactions occur, up to and including the right to delay them indefinitely. But they cannot make invalid transaction look valid to a full node.  
&gt;  
&gt; If you are not running a full node, the amount of trust you're placing in others increases.  
&gt; 
&gt; SPV nodes (such as some mobile clients, and Multibit) place a blind trust in the majority of miners, without checking validity of the blockchain they produce. It still requires a majority of miners to mislead an SPV node, but they can make it believe anything (including ""You received 10000000 BTC!""). The reason why this does not happen is because full nodes would not accept such blocks, and assuming a large portion of the ecosystem does rely on full nodes, miners who do this would not see their blocks accepted by the larger economy, resulting in them wasting money.  
&gt;  
&gt; Centralized services (most webwallets) make the user trust whatever the site says. They can claim anything.
&gt;  
&gt; So I hope you now see the importance of full nodes in this model. If you run a full node somewhere on the network, and nobody looks at the transactions it validates, it is indeed contributing to the network, but it is not helping with the reduction of trust.  
&gt;  
&gt; Look at it another way: if only a few large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem were running full nodes, it only requires a malicious intent, or an attack/threat against them, to change the system's rules, as nobody else is validating.  
&gt;  
&gt; Doing transactions in the Bitcoin ecosystem helps the Bitcoin currency. Running a full node helps the network. Using a full node helps you and the ecosystem reduce the need for trust.

Nice to see my favorite sub on reddit again and I hope everyone is  enjoying the wild ride of 2020. Volatility is your friend, especially on a scarce asset at the early stages of price discovery.  Don't let anyone convince you volatility is a problem, there are no crazy gains without it.

My outlook on bitcoin hasn't chanced, still a long-term bull, still holding my coins and steadily collecting. I fully expect another bubble by 2023, would even say that price discovery can't happen without these bubbles. 

The Paul Tudor Jones story is also pretty damn bullish, not that I needed any more reasons. People in denial are like ""*he's just trading cash settled FUTURES bro*""...man shut the fuck up. He wants exposure to bitcoin because he's fucking bullish on the price, his letter and interview basically validating many of the reasons bitcoiners have been bullish for years. The entire macro backdrop of the world also validates many reasons people have been bullish for years. When the big swinging dick of hedge fund gets in, others will follow or else when they under perform, because they still think bitcoin is a ponzi, they're gonna look like idiots. Bitcoin has been here for 11 years, it's not cute anymore to compare it with tulips, you're a fucking idiot.

fqbpyce,yeahdave4,15,"There's a fair bit of back channel discussion and nervousness going on in the BTC mining industry that many might not be aware of.

With the block rewards taking a 50% cut, more and more mining operations are going to be depending on transaction fees unless the price of BTC goes up.  Bitcoin is however relatively unused in terms of true transaction volume and so transaction income is expected to be insufficient after the next difficult adjustment.  Also now with batched transactions/Segwit there's even less net transaction fees to earn.

The hope then becomes that if the price of 1 BTC goes up but your fixed electricity costs don't change, then less efficient (non-Chinese) miners might survive.  However the difference between this halving and prior ones is that mining is now much more centralised in China and China has built significant mining infrastructure that give it a huge advantage.  There is concern that the Chinese miners that have been hoarding BTC recently will open shorts and use their large BTC pools to nuke the BTC price to put non-Chinese miners out of business (kind of like what happened with oil).  It will be interesting to see how things play out.

Large OTC desks who get their supply of bitcoin from miners essentially get their supply cut in half and need to sustain their business with more liquidity. Where do you think they'll get that from? Eventually all roads point to a increase in spot buying.

Quits black hat work and gets relatively clean. Starts a ~~grey Jedi~~ morally neutral hacker blog and gradually begins working full time in CyberSec unraveling and tracking digital locust plagues.

One day, a hospital worker can’t log into email and eventually all his appointments are cancelled. Later he realizes that this isn’t just his computer, or hospital, or hospital network. One locust plague took down all the computers and is charging lots of bitcoin to get them back.

Savant hacker dissects the code of a locust and finds a question that must never be answered or the locust dies. He answers the question and gets help from all of his hacker coworkers and friends to continue answering the question. This is a sinkhole. After a week of answering questions and warding off those who want him to stop answering questions, he is paid thousands of dollars to sleep.

Three months later, he parties during a hacker convention then gets arrested by the FBI for thhat black hat stuff he did a while back. What sorts of awful things does the Nevada prison system do to their inmates? Well, they did some of that to him.

Other hackers begin to help him and pay for insane legal fees. The community rallies and some people think he’s guilty, some people think he’s not, some people think he knew how to stop the really bad locust plague from earlier because it was secretly *him* all along. It wasn’t. It was North Korea. More than a year later, an old judge uses his experience to see that he’d be chaining down a super hero if he was “fair” with his sentencing.

Unlike most mod menus, it has controller support so i dont need to switch between controller and keyboard to use it. Impulse has a built in ScriptHookV Loader, meaning it can inject script mods such as Menyoo and Angry Planes into your game, and you can even use them online.  Impulse is the most feature packed of the menus.  Imp has a fleshed out player and vehicle blacklist system called Overseer, which is very useful for keeping track of certain players and making sure they are never in your session, or if you want to really mess with someone in particular and want to know whenever he's online so you can quickly join his session.  Imp does not have an official discord server, but there is a fan run server at impcord.xyz.  Impulse.one is their mainwebsite, but to buy it you need either bitcoin or cryptovoucher.  Many resellers also sell it, the reseller i bought my key from is resellerss.weebly.com

Phantom X:  Another fantastic menu.  It currently does not have controller support, but that is confirmed by the devs to be coming.  Phantom X's recoveries are also detected right now.  Phantom X is the best menu to get for coloading, as you can coload it with any other menu available, meaning you can use it at the same time as another menu.  I always coload it with Impulse.  Phantom X has great trolling features, and there is no menu that can defend against Pain In The Ass.  Phantom X also has two unique features that no other menu that i know of has:  A fully functional The Flash mod and Ghost Rider mod.  The Flash mod is the exact same one you can download from JulioNIB's Patreon, and while many other menus have a Ghost Rider mod, Phantom X is the only one where it ignites your vehicle as well as yourself, and it's the only one where you can actually burn someone from standing on them or punching them.  All the other menu's flash mods are just particle fx.  PX recently recieved a huge update adding a lot of protections.  PX has a great launcher that lets you see the menu's status as well as rockstar server's status, and it lets you view all of the available custom cars and outfits and download them straight from the launcher.  PX does not have a website, but they do have a vk page at vk.com/phantomcommunity.  PX also has a discord server.  I bought my PX account from recoverygods.com

Disturbed:  Disturbed is also good.  It is my least favorite out of the three menus that i own.  It lacks controller support and its menu design is ugly.  Its recoveries are currently detected, but they are the best method of recovery available.  Disturbed is the easiest and fastest menu to inject.  Its protections don't always work though.  Disturbed's black hole is very fun to use.  Disturbed doesn't really have unique features.  Disturbed's website is w1tch.pro.  you can find disturbed's discord server at their website, and you can also buy disturbed directly from their website.  If you need a reseller, i bought my disturbed from Voidshaman.com.  

Paragon is also hailed as a great menu, and while i can vouch for its rock solid protections, i cant vouch for anything else because i do not own Paragon.  Paragon's website is paragoncheats.com",2020-05-13 07:35:09

As a hopelessly over aspirational TA/total brown nosing teachers’ pet I decided that as a demo for the class I should reappropriate 6 used off lease dell optiplex into a cluster to mine, and kind of explain the mechanism as best I understood at the time. 

Mining the then nearly worthless ($0.50/BTC) bitcoin on a cluster of very not optimal off lease dell business machines 3yo at the time from like 2009 (remember that plastic cover on the optiplexes with the swooping curve that snapped shut over the one USB port on the whole thing? Yeah me too.) Mining was obviously not profitable at the time, but it was a beautiful demo of trustless transactions so it didn’t really matter. BTC was basically worthless so at the end of the semester the students obviously didn’t want the hassle of even one more task than was mandated by the state, so they didn’t take it.  I asked my boss, the classes real teacher, what to do with the coin we’d mined. She let me buy it at cost, cash. She said the money would go to the school’s party fund. I’ve always hoped and assumed it really went to her personal party fund, lol. So, $10 cash poorer and 20BTC richer, I proceeded to do nothing more for like 7 years.

In Fall 2017, I started to hear news about bitcoin being worth tons. “Gee whiz!” Thought I, at the time living my best life out of my fraternity house basement while slowly getting myself pushed out of school due to generally being a degenerate and not applying myself to graded work like I really should have been. “I wonder how many 30 racks of Hamms I can get for 20 BTC?” 

As it turns out, 20BTC (worth ~$100k oct 2017) affords you a lot of beer. So, like a month-ish later and after returning from Vegas with my roommate, I took went to the older and more responsible brothers of the chapter with 18 BTC and asked them what to do. 

“Pay of your dues!” One said.
“Hire an actual professional to look at the mold/broken wall/whatever” they had recently broken.

“Have you been following Tesla?” The vet science grad student chimed in from the back. “Bitcoin is too volatile. Sure it’s worth a lot now, but it’s not real. You have enough that you need in something tangible”

My whole contribution in effort or finance to this massive profit being $10 7 years ago, I opted to agree that I should act now and get into TSLA as soon as possible. So I made haste, and a few weeks later and not just a few more cases of beer I took just under 18 BTC and (through proper and legal channels, don’t worry) spent what had started as a $10 bill in the science lab on like ~200k of ~$350/share TSLA.
If I hadn’t been as drunk as I was at the time, I would have been sane and just taken the win and the huge pile of cash.

So now: that $200k at $350/share sat and it grew for a couple years. Recently, considering myself to be a more sober and sane person than in the past, I opted for the win. I took the cash, and got out. Which brings me to where I am today, asking for your advice!",2020-05-13 05:09:24

Quite the opposite. Tail emission is one of the most important features of Monero, and would definitely help Bitcoin too. Relying entirely on tx fees is a very risky plan to say the least. 

Tail emission is so small, it won't even cover lost coins. On the other hand it gives a significant boost to stability / security / miner incentive.

fqef7a7,Santos1986,8,"Pavel Durov:

For the last 2,5 years some of our best engineers have been working on a next-generation blockchain platform called TON and a cryptocurrency we were going to name Gram. TON was designed to share the principles of decentralization pioneered by Bitcoin and Ethereum, but to be vastly superior to them in speed and scalability. 

We were very proud with the result – the technology we created allowed for an open, free, decentralized exchange of value and ideas. When integrated with Telegram, TON had the potential to revolutionize how people store and transfer funds and information.
Unfortunately, a US court stopped TON from happening. How? Imagine that several people put their money together to build a gold mine – and to later split the gold that comes out of it. Then a judge comes and tells the mine builders: ""Many people invested in the gold mine because they were looking for profits. And they didn't want that gold for themselves, they wanted to sell it to other people. Because of this, you are not allowed to give them the gold.""

If this doesn't make sense to you, you are not alone – but this is exactly what happened with TON (the mine), its investors, and Grams (the gold). A judge used this reasoning to rule that people should not be allowed to buy or sell Grams like they can buy or sell Bitcoins. 

Perhaps even more paradoxically, the US court declared that Grams couldn't be distributed not only in the United States, but globally. Why? Because, it said, a US citizen might find some way of accessing the TON platform after it launched. So, to prevent this, Grams shouldn’t be allowed to be distributed anywhere in the world – even if every other country on the planet seemed to be perfectly fine with TON.

This court decision implies that other countries don’t have the sovereignty to decide what is good and what is bad for their own citizens. If the US suddenly decided to ban coffee and demanded coffee shops in Italy be closed because some American might come there – we doubt anyone would agree.
And yet, despite that, we have made the difficult decision not to proceed with TON.

Sadly, the US judge is right about one thing: we, the people outside the US, can vote for our presidents and elect our parliaments, but we are still dependent on the United States when it comes to finance and technology (luckily not coffee). The US can use its control over the dollar and the global financial system to shut down any bank or bank account in the world. It can use its control over Apple and Google to remove apps from the App Store and Google Play. So yes, it is true that other countries do not have full sovereignty over what to allow on their territory. Unfortunately, we – the 96% of the world’s population living elsewhere – are dependent on decision makers elected by the 4% living in the US.

This may change in the future. But today, we are in a vicious circle: you can’t bring more balance to an overly centralized world exactly because it’s so centralized. We did try though. We're leaving it to the the next generations of entrepreneurs and developers to pick up the banner and learn from our mistakes.

I am writing this post to officially announce that Telegram’s active involvement with TON is over. You may see – or may have already seen – sites using my name or the Telegram brand or the ""TON"" abbreviation to promote their projects. Don’t trust them with your money or data. No present or past member of our team is involved with any of these projects. While networks based on the technology we built for TON may appear, we won’t have any affiliation with them and are unlikely to ever support them in any way. So be careful, and don’t let anyone mislead you.

I want to conclude this post by wishing luck to all those striving for decentralization, balance and equality in the world. You are fighting the right battle. This battle may well be the most important battle of our generation. We hope that you succeed where we have failed.",2020-05-13 03:02:29

fqjewte,Pilebsa,8,"I'm a software engineer.  As well as a DBA.

Blockchain as a concept is just that: a concept.   It's an idea that revolves around taking information and distributing it among a random group of systems/servers.

The other half of the concept is the idea of how to motivate people to run servers to maintain/store the blockchain, using some kind of reward system like mining tokens or transaction fees.

In theory, it's an interesting, creative idea.

Whether it makes sense comes down to one simple question:  Is it an improvement?    Does it do something explicitly better than existing methods and resources in place?

This is the question crypto enthusiasts avoid honestly answering, or else they delude themselves into thinking it does do something better/faster/easier/more securely, etc.   In practice it doesn't, and if this isn't obvious to you that it does, you know why: It doesn't.

When you question adherents about the value of blockchain, one of the most common answers is not an answer, but a rhetorical question like, ""Do you know how many people thought the early Internet was useless?""   Or ""When fax machines came out, nobody thought they'd have much use.""    All these types of examples don't work.  E-mail and Internet services were instantly obvious as being an improvement over traditional mail.   The Fax machine was also an obvious improvement.  You didn't need to sit down and watch a 45 minute lecture in order to see this new technology did something better/faster.   

The fact that you are asking this question: ""Why is blockchain flawed?"" is another distraction. 

It's not that blockchain is ""flawed.""   It's just not really any ""solution.""  

Ask anybody to explain what blockchain does better than any other existing system?  You can't get a simple answer, because there is nothing.  It's an interesting technology that has not found a practical use.

I could go into the technical details of why blockchain is less efficient than traditional monetary management systems, but we don't really need to.   I can use a credit card and execute a transaction in one second.  To do the same using Bitcoin could take anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour or more.  And that's because of the design of the technology.

So why is blockchain popular?

It's not really popular in any significant sense.  It became a bit of a novelty and gained enough ground to have a certain critical mass of people adopt its use, and then became a platform primarily fueled by criminal activity and money laundering.  So there's a lot of dirty money in the industry, and where there's money, there's going to be hype and opportunists looking to exploit that market.   People involved in this industry have not invented a better mousetrap.  They just see a lot of money floating around in what is basically a Ponzi scheme, and they hope to get a piece of it before it implodes.",2020-05-14 07:29:36

Head out to the grocery store and yep, while I’m following on my phone and driving, Padres come back and win. 

I pulled over, threw up, and went back home to go to bed at 5:30pm

Edit : my wife was super pissed at the time since she had that money allocated towards bills, I told her I cashed out and the $900 was on the way before I placed that bet. At least she’s [cool now ](https://imgur.com/a/ckYWySw)",2020-05-15 04:25:22

fqnok5o,OverlordQ,14,"Your bitcoin balance isn't a simple ledger entry saying ""You have $x BTC"", it's a bucket of things called UTXOs or Unspent Transaction Outputs. 

When you send any amount of Bitcoin to anyone (even yourself), you must reference which UTXOs you're sending. To simpify, I'll ignore fees for now.

If a business receives transactions of .1 BTC, .2 BTC, .5 BTC while they'll have a total of .8 BTC, it's split across multiple UTXOs. 

If they then need to send, for example, .3 BTC there's numerous ways to do that. They could either send both the .1 and .2 UTXOs, or they could send the .5 UTXO with .3 BTC going to the recipient and .2 BTC coming back to themselves as change. 

With the first example, we started with 3 UTXOs and ended up with 2 UTXOs. In the second, we started with 3 UTXOs, and ended up with 4. 

Bitcoin transaction fees are based on how big they are. The more UTXO Inputs you use, the larger the transaction will be. So you generally want to trend to a smaller number of UTXOs so you're spending less on fees.

In this case, the user had thousands of thousands of UTXOs of small amounts. They consolidated them from 600 smaller UTXOs to 1 larger UTXO. This means if they ever need to send a larger amount of BTC, they'll have to spend less on fees to only use 1 Input vs tens or hundreds.

Unfortunately since BTC has a constrained blocksize they're paying *a lot* in fees to do this. For one example to send $7,193.39, they're paying $984.94 in fees so they're only getting $6208.45 out. This is nearly 14% in fees. 

Another example they're sending $3124.01, paying $829.48 in fees, or **26%**

Blockstream/Core/et all have been saying this is a good thing for years so they can push  users to their custodial solutions.",2020-05-15 08:23:22

Level of bullishness in here and on cryptotwitter feels very high. Feels like we may have a little more upside - maybe a run to $11k even, but that the overall risk is to the downside. 

Big picture question: Can bitcoin hit a new ATH in the midst of a global recession? depression? 

For every 1% decrease in US GDP (annualized) how much of a headwind does that create for BTC? 

Is there any strong evidence that bitcoin has transitioned to a flight to safety asset? If not, then is bitcoin still dependent on the macro environment (SP500) being positive?

The truth is, nobody knows the future. BTC could hard fork to bigger blocks and take a lot of BCH’s value prop. BCH could suffer a crippling community split over, oh, I don’t know, a funding proposal... BTC could crash and burn in spectacular fashion due to mempool backlogs Craig could finally make good on just one of his many threats and mega dump a ton of coins! I don’t know, but I prefer to position myself to win regardless even if I think that the model big-block Bitcoin has is superior to small blocks.

fqr90mm,nullc,13,"Some number of months back J.K. Rowling was the target of a social media drama-mob because she [tweeted support](https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1207646162813100033) of a researcher who made a comment which was considered by some to be insufficiently sensitive with respect to trangendered persons.

The firestorm died down after a while. But it could have continued.  J.K. could have found herself severed from her banking relationships and unable to receive payments for her publications-- just like Visa and Mastercard instituted a blockade against donations to Wikileaks years ago. Not because she broke any law, but because she was accused by an angry mob of supporting someone who was accused of being politically incorrect.

Isolated from her funding she might have found it much harder to endure the other negative consequences of being the target of a social media lynch-mob.

Bitcoin fixes this. Bitcoin is money that has minimal to no dependency on the whims of third parties. With Bitcoin you can't have your access to your coins or your ability to transfer them cut of just because someone has decided they don't like you or that you're a political liability.

Bitcoin protects your right to believe right things and your right to believe wrong things. It doesn't free you from the consequences of your actions, but it helps narrow the consequences to ones appropriate according to the rule of law rather than popular sentiment.

Of course, just having your money and your ability to pay and be paid protected from third party whim isn't enough-- but it's a good start and way to have some piece of mind. As the saying goes, good fences make for good neighbours. Keeping other people out of your finances is a ""good fence"". How you manage, earn, or spend your money is none of my business and vice versa.

Part of the reason we have money in the first place is specifically separate our judgement of people from our ability to transact with them. Once money was invented we could use it sell someone an apple without having to judge if they're a good person or not and without being to worried that our money would be dishonored by others because we accepted it from a person of the wrong politics, religion, or race. Money was just money: Fungible and equal. 

But prior to Bitcoin all electronic money systems relied heavily on trusting a third parties. This trust also implies intrusive regulation and surveillance just to keep the whole thing working. As more transactions have moved online the massive centralization of electronic payments has hurt the effective fungibility of the money we use. By eliminating the trusted third parties Bitcoin restores many of the best qualities of money in a natively online form.",2020-05-16 06:57:26

I always win. I got this market by the balls, and guess what, I think we're on the cusp of yet another great bubble that will take place over the next 3 years. Anyone who isn't taking advantage of this price appreciation is a fucking idiot as far as I'm concerned. There are no more excuses.

This is kinda incorrect information.

We've had 25% more users last month, and then 25% more on top of that this month. Around 57k new tachi users alone.

The problem is our lack of bandwidth between our cache servers and our cdn provider for old chapters. The servers we have coming online next week have increased bandwidth and will be able to push more files to Path.net's - who have plenty of capacity we are currently unable to use due to a bottleneck on our side - cdn.

Our current servers were supposed to last until the end of the year, but with Corona-chan and MR dying we've taken an extra hit to our infrastructure we weren't planning on.

If anyone's interested in helping us keep on top of server issues, you can help out by donating some Bitcoin or Ethereum if you are able to. See /support page on site for info.",2020-05-17 06:47:25

Gold is just as volatile within it's price band because currencies themselves are volatile and are swayed by macro-economic factors.

The difference with storing value in actual gold vs bitcoin is you have to defend that gold.  You have to transport that gold.  You gotta sell it for less than its market rate to convert it back to cash you can buy things with.

I dont have those issues with Bitcoin.  It's monetary policy makes it a better long term investment than gold despite the short term price volatility.  It's proven to be far more stable than the market in this pandemic.  All investments are speculative at some point which is why the common phrase ""past performance is no guarantee of future results"" is included in nearly every financial analysis.",2020-05-17 09:07:31

&gt;The platform is simple. When elected, I will swear in, walk to the White House, and sign one executive order. This executive order will lay out the process for dissolving the federal government in a peaceful, orderly manner. 

#

&gt;Some agencies will be very easy to do away with, like those that perform only regulatory functions like the Department of Education, or those that perform completely illegitimate functions, like the IRS.

#

&gt;Upon winning the election, our transition team will immediately begin the rollout of a new, decentralized monetary system by which we can pay back the American people and fund the bankruptcy process of the federal government. Every American will be issued 1,000 Americoins by social security number. Americoin will be a cryptocurrency that functions similar to Bitcoin. 

#

&gt;More important than the politics of this campaign, is the education about the nature of government and how we can apply it to live more free NOW! This campaign is about encouraging people to minimize the role of government in their lives and their role in empowering government. When you understand government properly, you relate to it properly. One of the most important ways to disempower government is to stop paying taxes (legally or illegally.) One of the most effective ways to do this is to stop using government money, and with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, this is easier than ever.

Ethereum gets around this by being pseudo decentralized which is of great benefit for solving problems now, however could turn into real chaos as politics starts to creep its way into development.

fqyghdw,romannumbers96,7,"First, I'm not a lawyer, nor am I in California.  However, I am pretty decently versed in general ADA issues (I've been working on a lot of ADA advocacy in my field, which includes a lot of places with MUCH more clear violations for the last year or so).  This is a HUGE post OP.  The Tl;Dr is that you aren't going to make this go away unless some very specific circumstances apply to you (again, with my limited understanding of CA law in particular, they might not apply, but they would be worth bringing to your lawyer), but there are some ways to mitigate this and to keep an eye on it in the future.

The problem is, in this sort of case, the onus is on you to prove it's not an issue.  Others saying that ""if you have video of other people with disabilities not having an issue they have no case"" is absolutely wrong.  The way these laws work, is that a violation is a violation when it comes to something in the letter of it in these cases, which is unfortunate because it weaponizes assholery like this against small business owners.  It's just like if you, say, didn't have proper refrigeration for health code or didn't have proper fire alarms or your building was made entirely out of plywood; it's a part of the building code.

That doesn't mean that there aren't some other options.  Nobody's mentioned anything about your landlord.  Look at your lease; something tells me there's something there on where the responsibility for property maintenance falls (which keeping up to code falls under).  If you find that it says your landlord's responsible?  Great!  Their problem now.  If not?  Well, you've got another potential avenue to make this go away.

While I'm not sure about California code specifically (and your lawyer that you have might be able to find this in particular), many states have built in ""grandfathering"" of buildings that were in place before the ADA.  When we're talking renovations, we're talking major structural changes; putting in a new freezer, for example, or some other change in your building that occurred since the ADA was passed.  If your building hasn't been renovated beyond a fresh coat of paint and bringing in some fancy bitcoin machines since the California ADA passed, and they have that clause?  Congratulations!  You tell this person to pound sand, and prepare all the permits to show that since you haven't renovated, you're in the clear.

In addition, does your store have any sort of wheelchair ramp or the like?  If not, then this case is even more in their favor.  If so, and if they could have taken an alternate route to avoid said step? 
 You could likely take it to a judge and have a good chance of getting it thrown out.  Not a perfect one, mind you; even their case of having the letter of the law on their side is very much one that isn't airtight.  But you'd have a good chance of being able to point out that the suit is frivolous.

Also, were you only given a demand letter, or actually served?  There's a good chance they just wanted to send a scary demand letter, since they know a lot of small business (and keep in mind, this PREYS on small businesses) will pay the smaller sum because they could never afford the larger one.  If you're served, always pay attention to it (and you have a lawyer already, which is a step above a lot of people) but until then, there's a non-zero chance that ignoring it would help.  I would advise against this because with this sort of ambulance-chaser they might still come after you to get any cash they can.  In addition, you said that this lawyer was well known for this.  I remember reading that a lawyer had been disbarred for this exact action.  Might be worth looking into that a bit further.

Now, some practical advice, especially if you don't have the wheelchair ramp: I'd look into getting one or cutting that step down if at all possible.  The thing is, while this suit is VERY much an asshole move, many of these accommodations end up being good for many people.  For example, it'll be far easier for vendors to get into the gas station to deliver goods if you have a ramp instead of a step, and they're likely going to visit far more often than someone in a wheelchair, even if that sort of cut is intended for people in wheelchairs.  

I'd also make as another commenter said and hire a CASP inspector to give your whole building a once-over.  If they decide to go to court it will look REALLY good on your end to say ""hey, we went to make the proper changes.""  There's no world where, for a one-time visit, 2 million dollars, or even 13k, is a reasonable penalty for your business, especially if they did their due diligence.  But they could refer you to be fined by the government for the violation, and taking steps to ensure compliance is important.  I would also go a step further; if there are any disability groups local to you that you have contact with, or even don't have contact with (ARC is my personal go-to, and any self-advocacy organizations are great as well if you need one), ask them to come out and start supporting them.  The idea of ""possession being 9/10ths of the law"" also goes for branding.  There's a reason people play their most sympathetic traits up on the court room.  If it goes that far, they'll paint you as a hater of the disabled (which, as someone who IS disabled and advocated for the disabled, is patently false 95% of the time when there are these violations).  You likely won't go this far.  But for a small business like yours, goodwill pays in other ways.

Lastly: it might be worth it to pay the 13k.  There's a non-zero chance of the lawyer ""discovering another client who happened to find another violation,"" and coming back for another 13k.  But if the options for the case being bs don't pan out, or you don't have the strength to go through all the rigmarole to risk the case in court or fight back before court, 13k could very much be a good way to end it.

I know there's a LOT here.  I hope at least SOME of it helps, and if any actual lawyers with more than my advocate's understanding of the ADA want to chime in and correct me on things I might misunderstand, I would appreciate it.  Though the last thing I want you to leave with: OP, your business did NOTHING wrong morally.  Sometimes, the letter of the law errs on the side of caution in comparison to the spirit.",2020-05-18 05:43:17

fqzyen3,RetardIdiotTrader,7,"There's a certain psychology to wanting to own altcoins. I'll break it down for you.

For the vast majority of people, they don't have the available capital to buy more than a couple of Bitcoins right now because who's going to spend five figures on speculative, magic internet money in the midst of a recession?

When BTC is at $20k+, there will be few people able to afford that much, but people will want in on the hype train. Owning less than one of a Bitcoin isn't that attractive. .3? .6? That's no fun. They want to own **lots**. It's also one of the reasons why I first bought lots of Litecoin instead of a few Bitcoins.

So, what do they resort to buying? Altcoins, and lots of it, because they want to feel like they own a lot of something instead of a fraction of a single coin. For this simple fact (along with some others), there will always be variety of different coins that will do better than BTC percentage wise, will have superior technology and people will be buying them no matter the underlying fundamentals because who cares about fundamentals when they're making money?

This psychology creates bubbles and was one of the primary reasons for our last bull run. If you take a look at the dominance chart, you will notice that the BTC dominance went down sharply during the height of our last bull run.

The same thing will happen the next bull run. I expect the dominance to retrace sharply to the 40% range and certain altcoins to gain their ratios back.

well folks, the whole world is mooning. 

Up. 
It's the only thing on the menu. Everywhere. 

I can't shake the feeling that this is a set up for an ugly retrace. Can it really be this easy? Just the possibility of a vaccine sets off a global orgasm. 

And yes, the economic data _is_ starting to rebound. But there was nowhere to go but up for a lot of these metrics. Let's take restaurants (OpenTable data): If we go from 0% to 60% of normal from mid-April to mid-June, how much should we be celebrating? 

A lot of indicators are still 90% from normal. TSA travel. Movie box office. Mobility is one that's bouncing back. And, relatedly, gasoline sales. 

But I just wonder if the depth of the downturn is priced in. And the fact that the economy isn't just some on/off switch. Flip it off. And then, with a flick of Trump's magical finger, it's on! 

Anyway, I'm definitely expecting a period of reckoning, where the hoped for V simply doesn't materialize. And people start worrying it'll actually be an ugly L.

And what's any of this have to do with bitcoin? Maybe a lot. If this ""Mission Accomplished"" narrative doesn't hold, then maybe we return to the volatility of March. Probably not quite that bad. But those shifts in perspective can come quickly. It takes just takes one punch to the face to knock off the rose colored glasses. 

Open interest is coming off its lows too. Not where we were in March, but approaching the May 9 number. What's the bitmex funding story? If longs have been paying for their leverage for a while, that could be another sign. 

Blah blah blah... I guess my point boils down to this: Don't get too comfortable.

In terms of cryptocurrency as an ""investment"", I'm not terribly bullish.  However, as a technology, I find it fascinating and I think it will eventually find its place in mainstream commerce.

The two biggest arenas in crypto that **interest** (*pun intended*) me are DeFi and stablecoins, because they really help to bridge some gaps between the fiat and crypto world.  I've always been interested in crypto arbitrage, however, it's too competitive for me to ever really make any money in it.  Frontrunners, transaction fees, withdrawal fees, etc. make it too difficult.

I think the future for cryptocurrency is bright, and I think Ethereum 1.0 has paved the way for many great things to come (and of course, none of it would have been possible if Bitcoin hadn't come along).  As new solutions emerge to help solve issues with transaction costs, speed, and total throughput, things can only get better from here.

fr3q9c4,yeahdave4,9,"UTC 04:30 9500/210

It is nice to finally trade into strength.  Even as Bitcoin dips lower the ratio acts as a shock absorber pushing us back to 210.  While there's only so much punishment it can take, if it holds and BTC gets back above the 1hr 100MA (9560 right now) I am expecting our next leg higher into $230- $240 and a move for BTC to break 10,000.  Approaching 280-290 by the end of the month becomes more realistic if BTC taps into ~10,500.

The only caveat to this is the next BTC difficulty change.  Discussed [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/ghi4w8/daily_general_discussion_may_11_2020/fqbpyce/) one week ago.  Miners are starting to drop off, but at a slow pace due to the price increase.  The next BTC difficulty adjustment hits in ~26hrs with a -7.2% change (and rising).  How BTC handles that will be key because come ~June 1st we may be looking at a massive (possibly -28%) adjustment.  It would be a miner bloodbath if the price wasn't significantly higher.

So some of my parameters roughly summarized:

1. BTC back over 1hr 100MA (9560 right now) before market open Tuesday

2. Making attempts at 10k or over 10k before next bitcoin difficulty adjustment in ~26hrs

3. BTC at or above 10500 by around ~June 1st (whenever the actual difficulty bomb is)

You can lend money to anyone in the world and earn interest on it, higher than a traditional savings account in your bank allows. There is no middleman, no fees besides transaction fees. No office hours, no time limits (you can pull out your money at anytime). Decentralized, trustless, feeless finance. Absolutely bonkers.

Stablecoins allow you to send money to anyone - at a stable price. No volatility involved. Worth mentioning: DAI, because it is actually decentralized as opposed to USDT or USDC.

And the whole loan/lend thing is just the tip of the iceberg of DeFi - want to own a house on the blockchain and get rent payments? [RealT](https://realt.co/) got you covered (not really decentralized, but it still enables the average joe to participate in the housing market). Want to insure the smart contract that holds your tokenized house? Use Nexus.mutual to insure against smart contract risk.

Want to participate in a no-loss lottery? Yes, you heard that right. A lottery that doesn't cost you anything. The stablecoins of the participants get loaned out and the pooled interest of all participants is collected and goes to one lucky winner: pooltogether.com

You can buy calls and puts on Ethereum using Opyn. Then there's Bitcoin on Ethereum - wBTC or tBTC, or soon RenBTC - that you can use to earn interest on your Bitcoin, decentralized.

We have corona and a very threatening and possible second wave that pressures the economy even further, and also summer is coming.  


The halving itself didn't create green needles and I personally doubt it that we just go up from here, break ATH and go happily home. I just don't.At this point I usually would bring up the memqueue and the scalability trilemma but trader don't care since they have money on exchanges and they just buy and sell apart from memqueue problems.  


Still, in the future it will be a huge problem. If they make lightning less centralized it's even better. There can be a great future for BTC and crypto, but I don't buy the bullish sentiment in the middle of a crisis.

IMHO: The real bullrun starts around christmas, ATH can very well be at 100k, why not. Scarcity is an argument if the fundamentals are right, but I don't see it yet.Hang me, I don't care. You don't make money via listening to the crowd.",2020-05-20 06:22:07

fr60lck,mushroomsarefriends,13,"When it comes to Bitcoin in particular, the system was never designed with the idea of operating off transaction fees. The idea was that initially the block reward would keep people mining, then eventually as that reward declines, some other solution would need to be found.

/u/Nullc aka Greg Maxwell was aware of this problem, so he sought a solution in the form of a limit on transaction capacity. This would require people to add a fee to their transactions, to be included in a block. As the block reward goes down, transactions would start paying for the system.

There are a number of problems with this idea. As has been pointed out to Maxwell by people, the idea of a fee market doesn't work, because it requires you to have a reliable and stable level of congestion. That simply doesn't happen. The median transaction fee has varied from 30 dollar during the height of the bubble, to a low of 10 cents when people lose interest in the system. What we see instead is that when transaction fees start paying for the system, the system implodes, as people move to alternatives (LTC/BCH, or they simply buy their drugs from the guy they used to know in college).

The second problem is that it doesn't work from a game theoretic perspective. Transaction fees screw up the economic incentives. Imagine there's no block reward. Some other dude just mined a block with 1 BTC worth of transactions. Now there are no transactions left with any fee. What's the rational move? Mine a worthless block? No, you're going to ignore his block, mine your own block with those transactions and hope that you find another block so that his block is orphaned.

So that's a big risk, but right now the most likely outcome appears to be that miners will simply turn off their rigs when there are not enough transaction fees. This decreases the rate at which blocks are found and forces users to overbid each other to get included in a block. In other words, they start throttling throughput. That's what we're seeing now: [Weird periods during which there are hardly any blocks and transaction fees jump up, followed by a return to normal.](https://fork.lol/pow/hashrate)

The big problem with that of course is that for a while users will overbid each other, but in practice it merely means a bad user experience: It now becomes expensive to use the system and unpredictable to tell when your transaction will be confirmed. Those users will move to alternatives (LTC/BCH, the guy they knew in college, etc). When that happens the price will probably collapse, which merely makes the problem worse, as the miners will now have even less incentive to mine.",2020-05-20 04:50:14

Bollinger bands are for volatility, use a Bollinger cloud and change it to 3 standard deviations in place of 2 (lots of reasons for this) Also TTM trends and/or harmonic patterns, you could learn candlestick patterns or trust a script like this one:

fr9e180,Prince_Farquatt,16,"Always interesting times in the world of Bitcoin. My hope is that regardless of what Technical Analysis you use, either you were positioned short or sold at the top before the 3% correction earlier today.

For about the last 16 hours or so, the 4H Intraday chart has been reflecting a price pinned beneath the upper trendline on increasing volume, while the lows have been pinned around $9,600 indicating a strong move was imminent. The failure to break the $9,840 price level on heavy volume signaled insufficient buyers in the market to push the Bitcoin price higher into breakout, sparking the first leg of the Wyckoff Distribution. Sometimes those bags can just get too heavy.

[4H Intraday Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ddfDH3AU/)

The Intraday chart reflects a low price target of $9,260 *should* have been realized \[$9,860 - ((($9,860 - $9,560)\*3)\*2/3)\]. In the end the bottom part of the new trade range was discovered at $9,300 or $40 above the target price, which is well within the delta I’ve experienced using the Vertical Count Method in Point and Figure. Also, $9,300 is a significant psychological support level.

Once the breakdown went beyond $9,500 (three boxes below the prior low), a Low Pole Warning was signaled. A Low Pole Reversal generally results in a 50% retrace in the breakdown range from the prior low ($9,560) to the bottom of the breakdown ($9,300), which would have targeted a retrace to the $9,440 level. The Low Pole Reversal realized the $9,440 price target, stalled, and then pushed higher as shorts covered their positions.

We are currently seeking the upper end of the new Intraday trade range. I speculate it will be around the $9,540 level.

If we look at a higher timeframe (1D), the most recent high topped out at $9,940 which was the same level as the Secondary Test of the upper range of this Wyckoff Distribution. A double top (which is Bullish in Point and Figure) was formed which broke the upper trendline of the formation, suggesting bullish bias and the Parabolic SAR flipped bullish as well. 

[1D Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/0wjxkKnl/)

While the signals all reflect bullish sentiment, I feel we will more likely test the lower end of the trading range ($8,120) and establish a Sign of Weakness (SOW) somewhere between $8,120 and $7,700 before retracing to the upper end of the trading range ($10,060) and possibly hitting $10,300 in a final Upward Thrust before completing the Wyckoff Distribution Phase.

Controversially, I'm sure, I really like the idea of cryptocurrency. Part of the appeal of Bitcoin, for me, was learning more about how the Fed works and how government's subjugate people via the currency. The entire idea if Bitcoin is that you no longer need to trust the Fed or the inevitable fraud of bank ledgers. Also, if Visa didn't want you to donate to Edward Snowden or Chelsea Manning, they wouldn't have a say because they never touch your money. Ethereum gave me some of my first glimpses into mutualistic coding. Somebody threw around an idea of public transportation via ownerless, self-driving cars that control their own maintenance and costs via a code-executed bank account. A federal government could also anonymously verify voters with tokens and do online voting. There was some country in eastern Europe, IIRC, that had success setting up an online citizen portal which got much higher voting rates, successful taxation, etc. because it was simple, convenient and online.

First, Craig Wright did not claim to own this particular address specifically, as far as we know. The list of addresses you linked to was provided by Steve Shadders, CTO of nChain. Since Mr. Wright said he could not provide an accurate list of the bitcoin he mined, he offered to ""narrow down"" the list by giving six criteria to Shadders and asking him to generate a list from it. (Unspent outputs, least significant byte of the nonce in a certain range, etc.) The list was meant to be a superset (ie - over-inclusive) of the blocks Mr. Wright mined. 

Shadders delivered the list, but he screwed it up badly and included thousands of blocks he should not have. [Read more about the ""Shadders Bug"" here](https://np.reddit.com/r/bitcoinsv/comments/cr94sd/steve_shadders_lied_in_court_or_is_a_moron_or/).

* They will include contract execution transaction fees on ETH when comparing to BTCs value-transfer-only fees.

As a result, **a contract execution will always cost more than a plain value transfer** - and that's reasonable, and makes sense. But BTC *can't do contract executions at all*, so people trying to distort facts to support their positions inflate the stated amount being spent on fees on ETH by including those more-expensive transactions that *can't even exist* on BTC.

The year is 2140 and the last BTC halving has just happened.  The block reward is now 0 and the final miner has converted their BTC to WBTC on the ETH blockchain.

Without a block reward, Bitcoin miners only have transaction fees to rely on. But since there are no more transactions, there are no more fees, and no incentives for miners to keep validating blocks. The Bitcoin blockchain is now a dying wasteland.  The last bastion of survival for its tokens are now on another Planet -- Ethereum.

True to the sacred accords of EIP1559, transaction fees are still paid in ETH.  Each time a WBTC transfer happens, a small portion of it is converted to ETH to pay for the transaction fee.  The relentless march of slow and steady WTBC&lt;&gt; ETH conversion continues....

The year is now 2240, and there is only a single satoshi of WBTC left.  It has become a curiosity, to be sold in an auction held outside the steps at the Temple of Vitalik.  Its buyer then ceremonially burns it - sending it to the genesis address, from which all tokens were spawned.

frdyc9o,TheGreatMuffin,9,"A node is a software that verifies your bitcoin transactions for you (implicitly it also verifies the overall supply of bitcoin, protects you from fraud from third parties, from ""fake"" bitcoin etc) and gives you a higher level of privacy (you don't leak sensitive information to your wallet's nodes, f.ex).  

Here's a great explainer by P. Wuille (although it doesn't even mention the privacy benefits):  

&gt; One of Bitcoin's strengths - the most important in my opinion even - is the low degree of trust you need in others.   
&gt;  
&gt;    
&gt; If you use a full node for your incoming transactions, you know that there was no cheating anytime in the history of your coins:  
&gt;  
&gt; * Nobody ever created money out of nothing (except for mimers, and only according to a well-defined schedule).  
&gt; 
&gt; * Nobody ever spent coins without holder their private key.  
&gt; 
&gt; * Nobody spent the same coins twice (but see further).  
&gt; 
&gt; * Nobody violated any of the other tricky rules that are needed to keep the system in check (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, ...).  
&gt; 
&gt; ... with one exception: because there is a need to pick a winner in presence of multiple competing valid versions of the ledger, (a majority of) miners have the authority to pick the version of the block chain that wins. This means their power is limited to choosing the order in which otherwise valid transactions occur, up to and including the right to delay them indefinitely. But they cannot make invalid transaction look valid to a full node.  
&gt;  
&gt; If you are not running a full node, the amount of trust you're placing in others increases.  
&gt; 
&gt; SPV nodes (such as some mobile clients, and Multibit) place a blind trust in the majority of miners, without checking validity of the blockchain they produce. It still requires a majority of miners to mislead an SPV node, but they can make it believe anything (including ""You received 10000000 BTC!""). The reason why this does not happen is because full nodes would not accept such blocks, and assuming a large portion of the ecosystem does rely on full nodes, miners who do this would not see their blocks accepted by the larger economy, resulting in them wasting money.  
&gt;  
&gt; Centralized services (most webwallets) make the user trust whatever the site says. They can claim anything.
&gt;  
&gt; So I hope you now see the importance of full nodes in this model. If you run a full node somewhere on the network, and nobody looks at the transactions it validates, it is indeed contributing to the network, but it is not helping with the reduction of trust.  
&gt;  
&gt; Look at it another way: if only a few large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem were running full nodes, it only requires a malicious intent, or an attack/threat against them, to change the system's rules, as nobody else is validating.  
&gt;  
&gt; Doing transactions in the Bitcoin ecosystem helps the Bitcoin currency. Running a full node helps the network. Using a full node helps you and the ecosystem reduce the need for trust.

frcz2o5,bitvote,9,"Quick thoughts: Feels like the energy and emotion behind the bitcoin rally have faded. 

Pre-halving excitement/fomo is done. We've had a few of big name mainstream investors say positive things about bitcoin.  And bitcoin plugs nicely into the BRRrrr meme-field. 

Some of that stuff is positive long term, but my sense is that the short term (next 1-3mos) energy may have peaked. And that leaves us vulnerable to a retest of some price level. Maybe it's $9k and we bounce between 9-10k for a while. Or maybe it's $8k and we bounce between 8-10k for a couple months. 

But the longer we spend at the lower end of one of those price levels, the lower the FOMO energy. And the more likely that we might drop down into a new zone. 

Overall I think there's a good chance we revisit $6k by July. Given how much is happening each week, there's a lot that could go down between now and July. And max pain feels like it's down. 

I've been rebuying here and there. And I just set up a daily buy on the Cash app. But I've got a lot of cash right now and it's waiting for $6k. Which also makes my bias explicit: Hoping for lower prices to rebuy :)",2020-05-22 02:08:10

As I understand it, Ethereum is eating bitcoin’s traffic and tx fees by bringing btc onto the ethereum chain and making that btc cheaper and faster to move and also more interoperable as wbtc (*edit: or some similar (decentralised?) alternative)*. When POS is in action, an ETH tx will be vastly cheaper than a BTC one; there’ll be no competition. It’ll be preferable for anyone looking to buy or sell bitcoin (including exchanges?) to use wrapped bitcoin WBTC. 

I find this idea really exciting and I think it’s creeping up on people. 

Sounds crazy but ETH might flip BTC much more quickly than expected if wrapping BTC becomes common, as it’ll render the BTC blockchain redundant.

fri1shj,FredCWilson,5,"5 Billion? Those are rookie numbers we need to get those numbers Up Up Up..5 Trillion..10 Trillion Come on now we can do it..

&gt;Based on 5 cents per kWh, the Bitcoin network needs to spend roughly $335,000 every hour, Alex de Vries, a blockchain specialist at Big Four accounting firm PwC, told Decrypt. **That means someone has to be on hand to buy nearly $8 million worth of new Bitcoin a day for cash**—just to secure the system. 

&gt;Those costs are putting the squeeze on miners right now. 

&gt;They earn 6.25 BTC every 10 minutes in block rewards. At $9,000 per BTC, that equates to $340,000 an hour. At the moment, they have to sell every BTC they mine to pay electricity costs. (Previous to the halving event on May 12, it was 12.5 BTC, so they were earning more.) The average costs will drop to 2 to 3 cents per kWh between May and September, de Vrie said. That’s because over 50% of Bitcoin mining is centered in the Sichuan province of China, which benefits from lower costs of hydropower energy in the wet season.",2020-05-23 08:43:29

frhzkvm,decibels42,5,"It makes BTC more useful, but you’re taking on more risk to use it in Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem than you would be if you just used/held ETH. 

And as we all have been saying, ETH does everything BTC does and more. Even the store of value argument for BTC will diminish over time as ETH’s increases.

BTCs SOV argument is that it’s a SOV because it’s a SOV. It’s circular. At best, it’s based on the fact that it was the first crypto + it has the most hash power/liquidity. But (1) it being first doesn’t necessarily mean it’ll always be first and (2) hash power/liquidity can change/decrease.

Meanwhile, with ETH, it’s SOV argument is strong, and will only get stronger over time. 

-	For starters, you always have the option to use your ETH to stake and earn interest, like a bond (can BTC do that without depending on the ponzi narrative?). 
-	In terms of issuance relative to BTC (which is a common FUD argument against BTC right now), ETHs issuance is going to be lower than BTCs for about a decade when we switch to POS (0.5% or less for ETH; BTCs is around 2% until 2024, and then 1% until 2028). ETHs issuance may even go negative by then. 
-	Also, the SOV case for ETH is stronger than BTCs because there is actual demand for ETH in hundreds of different use cases. ETH is actually being used for something other than being a digital paperweight. Meaning, there’s “insurance” about ETHs price simply by the fact that it’s now become the internet of value  and tons and tons of use cases require ETH (compare this to the circular arguments for BTC, which is based on a house of cards).

These points are very underrated right now, but will become more clear as time goes on. Particularly, the last bullet is *highly* underrated and rarely talked about.

—

Bonus: for example purposes, here’s a non-exhaustive list of use cases for ETH that’ll partly act as it’s “insurance”/justification for its SOV argument (as well as a very rough estimate for how ETH will be used amongst those use cases), 

see /u/argbargman2’s recent post, here:

https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/godvib/_/frguhfu/?context=1

&gt;\~30% to be on exchanges, liquidity pools, or cold wallet hodl's is normal I think. The rest will be spread among various other use cases. So far, the ones I can see are: 

&gt;* Staking - 1 million validators (\~30 million ETH staked) is a good target for security at full scale
* DeFi - borrowing against ETH or loaning to short sellers (\~3 million ETH locked right now)
* Interop-as-a-service - e.g. tBTC. Bitcoin isn't the only chain that it's useful to build a bridge to. Other chains will want to bridge to ETH. Private ETH forks will likely use the public chain as common infrastructure to interact with each other. All of these bridges will be collateralized by ETH
* Layer 2 - I would not be surprised to see plenty of L2 implementations require aggregators to be bonded with ETH.

&gt;ETH will probably flow between various use cases like this, depending on the yield offered by each. In the future, I could see the breakdown looking something like this:

&gt;* \~30% staked securing the PoS chain
* \~5-15% in DeFi (depends on DEX adoption)
* \~10% in IaaS
* \~15% in L2
* \~10-20% on CEX's
* \~20% in cold wallets or other",2020-05-23 08:22:34

Everyone keeps posting his non-explained TA that is nothing more than an assumption, literally based on nothing.   
In the march-crash bitcoin followed.   
There was a nice bounce and a good run towards the halving but since then, there is no reason for a pump left, hence it's going down since then. And Bitcoin is no Gold, nor safe haven for the world. Just a tiny fraction of people know how to use it, can or want to use it as a hedge.   


The following months are probably worse than what we've seen economy wise and unemployed people are not so reckless to put the rest of their money in a highly volatile asset like BTC.   


Also, there are millions of bitcoins in the hands of whales and even crypto funds from grayscale (and other big VC's)  are on the table and arguably against a bull in the future because they also own other assets and to cover the losses in the foreseeable future, what do you think they will do with all the crypto assets if a depression kicks in?

frtqurg,px403,8,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Andresen

Gavin was the one Satoshi put in charge of the Bitcoin project when he left. Gavin also started the conversation about raising the block size in 2012, and started really pushing for it in 2013. I spoke with him in May 2013 about some threats I saw coming down the pipe for Bitcoin, and he told me quite frankly that the only threat he was worried about was people trying to stall the block size increase. At the time I thought that was the craziest thing, because **EVERYONE** wanted the block size to go up, people just had different ideas on how aggressive or conservative it should be. I am still in shock about how everything went down, and how accurate his fears were.

Through some of the shadiest political maneuvering I've ever seen, he was ousted from the project in 2016. He had spent years trying to gather support for the Bitcoin Foundation to ensure Bitcoin developers could get paid from sources free from conflict of interest, attempting to prevent exactly the kind of hostile takeover that was performed by Blockstream.

He was probably the most honest, pure, true believer in the crypto-utopia that Bitcoin could create, and got run out on a rail by a bunch of shithead VCs and crypto kiddies looking to get rich quick at the expense of the rest of us. Absolutely fucking shameful.",2020-05-26 10:19:55
frspn06,ArticMine,7,"There is a huge misconception that all electricity is created equal implicit in the environmental / global warming argument against proof of work mining. This is the case for Bitcoin and even more pronounced for Monero. https://www.newscientist.com/article/2224037-bitcoins-climate-change-impact-may-be-much-smaller-than-we-thought/

The key point is that POW mining by seeking the lowest cost electricity tends to seek sources of electricity that have no or very lower economic value for example over capacity in remote hydro installations, off peak power etc.  The growth in renewable energy sources in particular solar and wind will increase these over capacity issues. For example: 

Consider a house that has enough solar capacity to meet its winter needs. In the summer there will be significant excess capacity. Furthermore if there is wide adoption of solar there will also be a very poor market to sell the excess power during the summer months. Mining Monero becomes a very attractive option of the this excess solar electricity capacity.  

A different but related example is the value of the heat produced by POW mining. If one heats say an apartment with electric resistive heating, then one can mine Monero at an effective zero electricity cost, since dissipating 1 kWh in an electric restive heater produces the same amount of heat as running Monero miners that consume 1 kW for one hour. 

Monero has in addition very significant advantages over Bitcoin here because Monero can be mined with CPUs. This makes opportunistic mining to take advantage of seasonal electricity and heat pricing much more attractive. 

I have mined Monero with the primary object of producing heat as opposed to producing Monero on many occasions. Any Monero produced as a by product of heat generation becomes a bonus. Think a rebate on your heating bill payable in XMR.",2020-05-26 04:33:25

The court would probably first order Craig to hand over the coins or some form of security for them so the court can distribute them. If he fails or refuses, it'll make the monetary judgment. But it depends.

I think a lack of understanding on jurisdiction is part of why some people don't understand what crypto can and can't do. It's true that a judge may have no way to actually compel the transfer of cryptocurrency. He can order and a sherrif or bailiff can try but without the passwords they simply will not succeed. But that isn't to say a judge can't make a finding of fact that the funds are yours and order a money judgment against you if you don't transfer the crypto yourself. Consequences if you fail to follow the order.

Really though the problem is they are here at all and they do not belong. We do not need more low skill immigrants to keep some businesses wages low.

Lets reach back into my past as a valuable fast food employee in my university days for an example.

I was a very very good kitchen employee. I could with 1 other person handle the orders that they used to have 4-5 low quality minimum wage people stand around doing before my time. You'd have 1 person on the grill, 1 person making burger buns, 1 person working fryers 1 person doing prep work and 1 person doing dishes.

I convinced my manager to get rid of those people and pay me more money. Or rather when people quit to not replace them.

I was making the most money in that restaurant by the time I left aside from my actual manager but the business was saving money, food quality and service times were UP and everyone was happy.

My point is if you pay shitty you mostly get people willing to do the minimum they can and you need a lot of them. If there is a worker shortage and you offer MORE MONEY, you get motivated people that will work hard to make more. That's good for everyone involved.",2020-05-26 07:32:16

My plan for today is simple: If we close a daily above 9150, I am holding this, because I am still almost certain that we start and continue a huge move. If we don't I will severely reduce the position since that would indicate it's just a temporary rally in a seemingly never ending range. A close above would confirm a higher low and put us back into the old consolidation range. Consolidation ranges in a bull flag are almost always bullish. Since the pole of the flag is about 2-3k long, I am expecting the move to be that amount. Again, zoom out, and you can see that it so far looks like a bull flag.

P.S. Last time I commented, there were people who kept attacking me for being bearish at 7K. Yes, I was bearish then and I was wrong. I did long from 8k to 10K and shorted at 10k with proof on this sub and that made up for my mistake. This is similar to how Wardser was right about this bull move but was wrong tons of times before. So what if I'm right and wrong many times, or really anyone else? Traders change their minds and that's how people make money. You just have to be right more times than you're wrong.

*By Vildana Hajric*

Bitcoin’s trading above $9,000 once again, but technical indicators suggest the largest cryptocurrency is stuck in a funk.

Though the price level may provide support, Bitcoin needs to break out of the downtrend it formed when its May high failed to take out the one reached in February. Any further rally that withers before overcoming a previous high may signal Bitcoin entered a potential downtrend, further indicating bearish sentiment.

The token is facing bearish sentiment and “a healthy pullback might be needed before it can break above the $10,000 level again,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, wrote in a note.

Technicals suggest Bitcoin could be mired in a downtrend
Bitcoin rose as much as 3.7% to $9,190 in New York trading on Wednesday. Peer coins including Dash and Litecoin also advanced.

Since its historic halving event earlier this month, which reduced the rewards miners receive, Bitcoin has been stuck in narrow range. Despite predictions the event would help push up its price, the world’s largest digital token has thus far failed to meaningfully climb above $10,000 -- though many enthusiasts forecast that a significant rally is still in the cards.

A number of high-profile investors, including Paul Tudor Jones, have in recent days voiced their preference for the token amid colossal interventions by central banks around the globe. Many argue Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could benefit in an inflationary environment.

ICYMI: Crypto Die-Hards Turn Back to Origins With Anti-Inflation Push

For Bloomberg Intelligence’s Mike McGlone, low global bond yields, increased equity market volatility and rising debt-to-GDP levels are positives for Bitcoin.

“We view the benchmark crypto as a resting bull that likely needs something to change significantly in its 10-or-so-year history to not just resume doing what it was doing: Appreciating,” he wrote in a note. Should the stock market sell off dramatically again, Bitcoin could stand to benefit.

Bitcoin is leverage. Fiat or fiat-like coins / government-issued crypto is inevitable and BTC itself will likely be a backbone and not a day-to-day payment network (maybe on lightning and 3rd layer it can be, and will be, but that will not be its primary use-case).

You're absolutely right. Leverage bitcoin into debt. Debt, today's fiat price, and interest rates are based on today. In 10 years, you'll be able to pay off that Audi, or Lambo, with a fraction of coin. Better yet, DONT pay it off because if you can hold that debt for 10 more years, every year a smaller amount of coin pays that year's payments. Maybe this year it's 0.1BTC to cover your car payment every month,, but in 10?

Especially in season of covid, you're absolutely right. Acquire hard assets via debt. Acquire means of production, land, housing, etc. Those things appreciate while debt at best remains the same.

Either the user's own full node or a more or less random node on the network somewhere. In any case, in order to be able to ""talk"" to that node (to ask for balances, transactions etc), Electrum needs something like a bridge software (between the wallet and the full node).  

ElectrumX is one of such bridges (besides others like Electrums, Electrum Personal Server etc). The maintainer of the Github repo of ElectrumX seems to take the approach of ""Bitcoin = BitcoinSV"" now.  

That's not much to worry about, the original code will be maintained and developed in a fork repository, as it already happened: https://twitter.com/orionwl/status/1266045381143597057  

Nothing changes for people who currently run the ElectrumX code (remember, in order to update, you need to proactively download and install software, there is no ""push"" updates). Just that they need to go to a different Github repository for updates from now on.  

edit: also a good example that a maintainer of any Github repository has more of a janitor role than anything else...

fs8k1rf,GameDaw,8,"I've gone into it on here a few times, but basically, I had a sizeable amount of BTC on Gox, mainly as backup for daytrading if Bitfinex went down.  Exchanges went down a lot back then, so you wanted to be able to countertrade your other position on an out of commission exchange if it came to that.

However, I wasn't even trading on Mt Gox much and heard the warnings about it, so really should not have had that BTC on there. I take the blame for that. I was able to withdraw some of it, but then they just stopped processing withdrawls.  

When shit started to hit the fan, the BTC price started tanking on the Gox exchange, while was still normal on other exchanges, so I did make the smart move to sell my BTC and then just buy back even more a few minutes later at a much lower price.   I think it got down to $100 at the end, when the price on the other exchanges was $400.  I doubled the amount I had on there in a few hours. 

It was clear that it would be shut down soon and the big question was did you want to have a BTC balance or a fiat balance when it did. I went with BTC.

So then the exchange did shut down officially, and when that news hit, I was in chatroom and heard it quickly.  I shorted the market pretty hard (but not nearly aggressively enough) and in a few minutes, I made even more BTC profit on that trade than I had lost on Gox.

Then Bitcoinbuilder.com allowed one to buy and sell Goxcoins at a discount.  At one point, you could pay 5% of the value and get a full Goxcoin, which was likely going to be worthless, so it was a risky play.   I like to gamble, so I bought up a bunch of them.  I had about 100 at one time, but then I heard that Gox had zero assets, so I sold most of them (got a little real BTC back out).  The fact that I didn't sell all of them is surprising to me now, but I like to make a low risk/super high reward plays and that was certainly one of them.

Bitcoinbuilder owner said that he would leave the Goxcoin trading open indefinitely, but then he shut it without warning a few weeks later.  So I have funds locked up in there as well.

Soon after that, Karpeles announced that he ""found"" a couple hundred million dollars of BTC in some cold wallet that he had forgotten about.  So that meant that they did have some assets.   

Then there was going to be bankruptcy where you just got a small portion $, based on your BTC that was valued at $400 when it shut down.  However, the price of BTC shot up in 2017 and then last year it was changed to a civil rehabilitation proposal where you get something like 15-20% of the BTC that you had on the exchange.

I am not a holder, and otherwise, I would have sold/hedged what I had on there, so it will be a sizeable lottery win if there is a distribution and I get those funds.  Plus I have even more on Bitcoinbuilder, so if that guy comes through, it will be a double lottery win.  Not life changing money, but living expenses for a few years money.

Of course there's a good chance I will get nothing.  And lately, when I have some of my goxcoins hedged, and BTC goes up in price, I am just losing real money in my Bitmex acct, and that's it.

So that has been the 6 years (and counting) long drama of Mt Gox.  People like to say it turned me off to Bitcoin, but I already came out way ahead with it, and could be a major score, and win, in the end.  T

The later Bitfinex hack and did hurt and that definitely turned me off to the corrupt crypto infrastructure that largely remains to this day.

fs91fwj,bitusher,5,"**Review of the ""differences"" with current fiat**

&gt;1) Tokenization

this already exists with regular fiat today from online payment , to apply pay , to samsung pay . Perhaps they mean this new currency will not support what many people use to make payments like traditional credit and debit cards

&gt;2) Third format of currency: A digital dollar will
operate alongside existing fiat currency and
commercial bank money.

This is excellent new for Bitcoin as it means that if the USA adopts this they will downgrade themselves to the likes of a third world country whose local fiat is so poor that they need to barter between USD + their fiat. An extra currency creates more friction and inefficiencies. I doubt this will add friction from bartering different rates as they both  will be pegged but  mainly friction from technical and regulatory differences between the old and new where both will now need to be supported

&gt;Privacy

Nothing in the whitepaper discusses the details. It looks more like a marketing brochure lacking any specifics. I can guarantee it will not be private however.  

&gt;Monetary policy neutral + Maintenance of the two-tiered
banking system


So how is this different than current fiat?

&gt;To verify the transaction, you only need to verify
the authenticity of the bill (the token), and because each bill is unique, it is impossible to spend
the same bill more than once at the same time.

Ok, This is indeed unique and very scary. It means a total lack of privacy because every digital transaction you make  will uniquely identify the source of the digital fiat and history directly to the federal issuer and not a private bank

&gt;might be lower than the costs of hosting a traditional bank account, 

This is highly doubtful 

&gt;The wallet could be readily
registered through a regulated hosting intermediaryb performing requisite Know Your
Customer/Anti-Money Laundering (KYC/AML) checks. 

AML/KYC with per penny tracking of every tx you make from the federal level instead of private banks gathering this info and sometimes sharing it with regulators.

Great news for BTC!

&gt;In a token-based system, the token contains all information necessary for the recipient to verify the
legitimacy of the transaction, and the recipient can verify the object transferred

Well no, that isn't how it will work in practice. Perhaps private banks and certain intermediary will be cut out of authentication but this information will also be shared with the issuer and central bank to allow for censorship and reversibility. There is no way they are creating a digital bearer asset like Bitcoin. 

&gt; distributed ledger technology (DLT)-based or -inspired 

They learned from r3s mistake and not using the term ""blockchain"" with a non proof of work currency. 

&gt; Key to this model is its ability to automate—and
thereby enhance the efficiency of—transactions.

There is no way they are going to be able to remove human auditors and regulators from their Proof of stake coin. No efficiency is going to be found here. 

&gt;Account-based systems rely on authentication to authorize an instruction

So ""state"" or account instead of more efficient UTXO model that Bitcoin has. Basically , what digital fiat already does. 

&gt;...compliance and regulatory processes (e.g.,
AML/KYC) are properly enabled...Fourth Amendment protections 

vague talk of the 4th amendment with no details or proposals 

&gt;A user would have the
ability and choice to hold their digital dollar in
their digital wallets, or deposit it into a bank
account,

this is new. So they are giving fiat owners an opportunity to lose their fiat when they lose their phone and backup like Bitcoin users ? They are undermining one of the few advantages of registered value here. 

&gt;National Security:CBDC should be configured to provide effective infrastructure to support
transactional security standards such as KYC, AML, Anti-Terrorist Financing (ATF), and anti-fraud

More effective means to shutoff funding to journalists , political groups and all sorts of businesses(operation chokepoint)

&gt;Interest-Bearing

like fiat in a savings account?

&gt;Transaction Security: Transaction security across multiple dimensions like KYC,
AML, counterfeit, and fraud must be considered. The maintenance of the US
two-tiered banking system allows existing financial institutions to maintain and
deploy their KYC/AML policies wh

Business as usual than here

&gt;Validation and Governance... model of public-private partnership.

So the fascistic private banking relationship model with the government remains. Understood.

&gt; digital dollar would also enhance payment transparency, thereby supporting the Fed’s
objective to promote safe

The fed isn't willing to be audited so I doubt the transparency will be with politicians and banks who are highly private. The transparency will be with citizens who now lack privacy.

This ended up being longer than I expected so I will break my thoughts down into multiple posts over the next few days.

&amp;#x200B;

* Remember we were all crypto-noobs once. Be kind and helpful to the influx of newcomers who will be asking seemingly dumb questions in the upcoming bull-run.

&amp;#x200B;

Here’s my embarrassing crypto-noob story. I was introduced to Ethereum by a friend I used to game with. He told me he was crypto mining and recommended I should do so too. I had an RX480 in my gaming PC and I had free electricity in my university dorm so I was in the perfect situation to mine. It was literally $5 per day of free money. I quickly realised why mine this stuff while the price is shooting through the roof when I could just buy it?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, so here come the stupid parts. I signed up to a local crypto exchange and I bought 0.1 BTC for a couple hundred dollars. Having seen posts from newly made Ethereum millionaires from r/ETHTrader, I quickly thought 0.1 BTC is never going make me rich. I got full FOMO and sold it for ETH, thinking that 1.5 ETH would be a better bet because at least then I own a whole ETH. I didn’t take into account market cap, circulating supply or any of the important economics behind token valuation. Hell, for 4 months I didn’t really know the difference between a token and a coin, I didn’t know that ETH is called Ether and the network was Ethereum. In my mind I ""owned 1.5 Ethereum”. I kept seeing people in the r/ETHTrader daily complaining about ICOs and whales dumping all the while I was being called a gentleman. \*\*\*I was confused but I was excited for this thing I couldn't understand.\*\*\* For about 4 months I was clueless. I would buy OMG at $6 just because members of the subreddit told me to. I kept my ETH on an exchange and I told all my friends how this thing I couldn’t come close to explaining was the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Slowly but surely, thanks to my excitement, I persisted and learned all the terms, I learned what a smart contract was and why Ethereum is more than just a Bitcoin 2.0 (yes I bought Ether and held it for months before I knew that Ethereum was more than just a currency 🤦‍♂️). I learned how to distinguish a scam from genuine project and I learned how to securely store my crypto. The important thing to note here is that I learned almost all of this from r/ETHTrader and the daily discussion there. Had r/EthFinance been around back then, I’m sure this helpful community would have helped me to understand this space even faster. What I’m saying is that it is important to welcome noobs and their noob questions. It will be frustrating to see new people every day asking “What’s a DeFi?” and “Can someone help me Dai?”.

The price of bitcoin drops for one reason and one reason alone: because there is higher sell volume than buy volume.
