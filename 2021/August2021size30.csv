&gt;Ethereum vs #Bitcoin. Looks impressive with 2.16 Billion dollars 'locked' (nice ponzi mechanic, supply lock = price moon for ETH right?)

&gt;The biggest ETH DeFi dApp Compound has 967 users. 

&gt;Locked $ / users = $700,000 per ""user."" ETH DeFi users = traders

Notice how rapidly the stupidity stacks up:

- Inexplicable quote-marks around 'locked' to insinuate... what, exactly? That the smart contract has risks? That the value isn't truly locked but rather can be accessed in minutes? But why bother with precise, verifiable statements when it's easier to snark aimlessly?

- Here's a ""fact"" ($700,000 USD per Compound user)

- Here's a casual conflation of all DeFi with a single component thereof (Compound isn't even the top DeFi provider in total funds, that's Maker!)

- Here's a random assertion (lock-ups = ponzi mechanic, which seems to imply that **all** collateralized loans are ponzis)

- Here's an extremely poor extrapolation from the previous ""fact"" (ETH DeFi users = traders)

Somebody [graciously lets the guy know how DappRadar works](https://twitter.com/bax1337/status/1281253345131245569), because reading is hard: the #'s represent total users that interacted with the contract within a specific time-frame. His ""fact"" neglects that he's using the number of Compound users in the last 24 hours.

Lesson being, OBVIOUSLY, IF YOU SPEND EVEN HALF A SECOND ACTUALLY THINKING INSTEAD OF SEARCHING FOR ANY GARBAGE THAT BACKS UP EXISTING PREJUDICES, that **these time-bound metrics are extremely poor proxies for total users**.

So of course [the guy immediately repeats the exact same mistake, but with the number of users through the last 7 days](https://twitter.com/bradmillscan/status/1281301993752080385).

g00mctu,Academic_Crypto,17,"I haven't posted or visited this sub in a while, but I see a  lot of people who are confused about the market micro-structure right now, so what I am going to do here is describe what is happening in the market atm.

The first thing to point out is that the open interest (OI) on derivatives products is relatively very high right now ([image](https://imgur.com/Pl6UgNX)), and this isn't even considering the options markets. Currently this figure is about 5 billion USD, and approximately the same as the top that formed in February of this year. There are essentially two kinds of products at comprise this open interest, there is (1) perpetual futures which do not have a settlement date and instead have a funding rate that is paid either continuously or every 8 hours and track the spot price and (2) settled futures which do no have a funding rate and incur a premium to spot assets.

A year or two ago these futures products existed primarily just for Bitcoin, but in the last year they have been increasingly offered and utilized for other crypto assets as well. The main exchanges where these are traded are BitMEX, OKex, Huobi, Binance, FTX, ByBit, Deribit, Bitfinex.

A question that I see confounding a lot of people is ""Who are the actors that own the long and short side of these record breaking levels of contracts?"". Answers in this sub range from an organic distribution of individual traders to a huge short-seller that has failed to successfully suppress the price of Bitcoin that is about to get destroyed. Unfortunately the truth is far more boring.

The long-end of these derivatives products right now appears to be nearly entirely comprised of retail and institutional traders that want leveraged net-long exposure to cryptocurrency assets. The short-end of these contracts however is increasingly being owned by arbitrage agents that are net-neutral and are arbitraging the premium over spot markets that people are willing to pay for leveraged exposure. Let me describe how this strategy works:

To see how this works, suppose that the spot price of Bitcoin is $10,000 however the price of a Bitcoin future contract that expires on September 25th 2020 is $10,100, or roughly 1% higher. In an arbitrage strategy known as ""[cash-and-carr](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashandcarry.asp)y"", an actor can sell the future contract and simultaneously buy spot Bitcoin. Their net-exposure to the price of Bitcoin is zero however they have pocketed the difference between the spot and futures price  as long as they are willing to wait for the future contract to settle. This person is going to look like a short-seller because they own the short end of a futures contract, but they are in fact neutral. Agents that engage in this trade are constrained because they have a limited amount of capital, they don't want to use all of their money arbitraging a small premium if they suspect that a larger premium may present its self later. For this reason, the number of contracts / Bitcoin that they are willing to arbitrage increases as a function of the size of the premium. For example, for every $1 premium that opens on the settled futures contract, I might be willing to sell $1 million in futures contracts and buy $1 million in Bitcoin. As the premium increases, so does the size of my short futures and spot Bitcoin position.

if we look at the premium or ""basis"" on the OKex quarterly futures Bitcoin contract ([image](https://imgur.com/XWKu9YO)), we can see that the premium has gone from around $90 to $370. This premium can also be understood as an implied borrowing rate or the daily interest that buyers are willing to pay for leveraged long exposure to Bitcoin. The implied borrowing rate of [BTC](https://imgur.com/5Z1kXst) and [ETH](https://imgur.com/hYmr2qI) over the last few weeks has gone parabolic, jumping from the stable long term rate of around 0.025% per day to nearly 0.07% per day or almost 30% APR. If these plots look familiar its because they are, this same trend was spotted in [February 2020](https://imgur.com/YPeH6OU) when the implied borrowing rate of BTC and ETH briefly touched 0.1% per day before the derivatives ecosystem collapsed.

This cash-and-carry strategy also works with perpetual futures contracts since the funding rate captures the implied borrowing rate on settled futures. The strategy is the same, just short the perpetual future while buying spot and enjoy the price arbitrage as well as the funding payments on the perpetual futures position which holding no Bitcoin exposure. If premium that traders are willing to pay decreases, and therefore the futures basis shrink and the funding rate decreases, then the position is un-wound by selling spot Bitcoin and buying the futures contracts.

There are two ways that we can check to see if this strategy is being employed. The first thing that we would expect to observe is that the leverage being used by short-sellers is relatively constant as the price changes since they actually maintain a neutral position. OKex fortunately allows us to see just this ([image](https://imgur.com/Jt5yeK5)). In the last day or so, the price of Bitcoin has increased considerably, 5-6% but the leverage being used by the owners of short contracts is relatively constant. Typically what has been observed in the past week is that as the price decreases, the leverage of longs increases considerably but the leverage of shorts is invariant to price movement in either direction.

The second that we can check is to see if the open interest (OI) of these products is roughly correlated with the basis or premium on them. As the premium increases, the reward for this arbitrage also increases, and the more capital that will be deployed in that trade, thereby increasing open interest.  This does appear to be the case for [BTC](https://imgur.com/nxCz64p) and [ETH](https://imgur.com/qwS1gwm). These plots would be more informative if they included the basis instead of the absolute price, but as I showed earlier, the basis has expanded in these products nearly 1:1 as the price has increased.

Another symptom of this taking place is that the arbitrage between futures and spot is poor. I saw that someone else recently mentioned it in this thread, but large gaps are opening up where the futures get way ahead of the spot markets when they are pushing up because MMs are reluctant to arbitrage the difference. This is very likely due to their capital supplies being limited due to an already significant cash-and-carry position that they have established.

\-----------------------------

So what does this all mean? What it means is that we are in a situation where the demand for leveraged long exposure to cryptocurrency assets far exceeds the spot demand. Currently traders are willing to pay somewhere in the neighborhood of 30% APR for this exposure due to the rapidly increasing prices. Additionally, a significant amount of the ""shorts"" on these leveraged products are in some sense, fully priced into the market because they are actually part of an arbitrage strategy between the spot and derivatives markets. This is not to say that they cannot be ""squeezed"" or ""liquidated"", just that, upon their derivatives positions being liquidated they become net-long the underlying asset and have a choice to either continue to be net long or sell their spot holdings to once again become neutral while making a handsome profit.

There other implication is that we are in a situation where its very likely that most actors in an otherwise symmetric long/short derivatives instrument are actually net-long or neutral due to their spot positions. A second kind of actor that I didn't mention is those who use futures as a means of hedging their Bitcoin. For example, suppose that you own 5 BTC and think the price is high and wish to sell, however you don't want to sell them on a KYC exchange and incur a taxable event. What you can do instead is send 1 BTC to a non-KYC exchange such as BitMEX or Bybit and use it to go 5x short, giving you effectively USD exposure while also being paid funding.

Historically, the only time the ecosystem has looked like this was February-March of 2020 when the premiums on these products slightly exceeded what they are now. This of course ended with a collapse of the derivatives market when the price did finally decline into the significant long-side leverage that had accumulated. This is understandable because almost all of the money in the ecosystem is either net-long or part of a net-neutral arbitrage or hedging strategy.",2020-08-02 04:57:41

g059gtd,readcash,12,"&gt; However, on a system such as Bitcoin Cash, there are already many existing users. Bitcoin Cash has a script system that has time based features, such as locking coins for a certain amount of time before they are spendable.

&gt; These features are essential for many smart contract systems, notably payment channels or recurring payment solutions such as Mecenas. These contracts do not have a source of time, and therefore use the blockchain itself as a clock. **Changing the block time would therefore effectively change the speed at which time passes for all these contracts, breaking the system they are built upon.**

&gt; To add to the challenge, Bitcoin Cash supports P2SH, which means we are not aware of all the scripts that are associated with existing coins. It is **not possible** to parse the blockchain and devise a system that would work for existing contracts, so we are forced to devise a system that will work for all contracts that could have been written. It is not certain that this can be achieved at all without **serious downsides,** but what is certain is that **nobody has the time or resources required to make an honest attempt.**

&gt; **Without a solution to this problem, we do not have a very concrete proposal to change the block time we can discuss.**

[Here is the Chart:  11:37 AM EST](https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/pnf.php?c=%24BTCUSD,PWTADANRNO[PA][D][F1!3!!!2!20])

We were in a pretty long, long pole.  I suggested the other day we could get as high at the 12,500 range, and then drop back under 11 on the pull back.  While not to the dollar, it was pretty close.

The pole from the first breakout last week was 48 boxes, peaking at the 12,100 box.  The reversal from that point should have been about 24 boxes, or $1,200--taking it down to $10,900.  I never in 100 years figured it would happen in 15 minutes on a Saturday night.

This is bitcoin and that is how it works.

Where do we go from here?  Based on the past formations we tend to pump, dump and dither for a few days.  I think we will bounce around these areas for a while unless we see some things:  If the stock market pukes a lot, we will drop back into the $9,000s.  If gold continues to rage, we should move up with it.  If the world starts closing down again because of the virus or big riots break out in the US...we could see some instability.  I know China is playing around with allowing its people to buy gold--that could have an impact.  China ALWAYS has an impact.

We are in an interesting place.  Since the price moved upwards earlier in the day, the chart ADDED Xs to the column.  We will not see any reversal until tonight when the new day arrives at 12:00 UTC (20:00 EST).  If the price doesn't rip up higher we will not even start the formation of another pattern.  The pop up will just be a long pole in the middle of the existing pattern, and that patter will be wider.  What would have been a brief four column pattern would now need to be at least seven columns to move upward.  That is definitely a more stable pattern for growth.  The next break out would take us closer to $14k.

Don't get too bummed out about the drop.  We are literally where we were two or three days ago.

And I believe many others shared my feelings as well (or at least used to) but Bitcoin ABC keeps shooting their own foot for no good reason.

Marc De Mesel used to donate money to Bitcoin ABC, as had I, as had many other Bitcoin Cash supporters... but now these people are really unhappy with Bitcoin ABC. Of course if you piss off people who donated money to you, who supported you in the past, then they are not going to donate money to you anymore. Is it difficult to understand why Bitcoin ABC has a funding problem?

Another fact is when Roger/Bitcoin.com spent huge sums of money defending Bitcoin ABC against lawsuits from BSV, instead of being appreciative, Bitcoin ABC was still unimpressed that Roger/Bitcoin.com wasn't doing more. I thought that was being handled badly as well.

Or when I reached out to Bitcoin ABC to ask them not to proceed with IFP just yet (give Flipstarter a chance) because there is a team of people who dedicated weeks of their lives and built Flipstarter with the main purpose of helping Bitcoin ABC get funded (because Amaury keeps complaining about their funding problem). When people did something just to help you and you come up with something else to undermine their efforts, you're essentially giving these people the middle finger. In case you're wondering why all the Flipstarter campaigns got fully funded except Bitcoin ABC, maybe this is one of the main reasons.

There are 2 ways you can deal with a problem when it happened. Acknowledge the problem and deal with it so there is no problem left. Or continue to blame others, blame the whole world, ignore the facts of reality (eg. Bitcoin ABC conflicts with big BCH investors like Roger, Justin Bons, Marc De Mesel) and give all sorts of excuses instead of solving the actual problem.

Think for yourself which is the better way to solve a problem. In my opinion, Bitcoin ABC supporters should stop giving excuses and condoning behaviors that is not helpful to Bitcoin ABC.",2020-08-03 04:38:44

g04obvo,Railionn,7,"End of SEPTEMBER is the scheduled testnet of Mimblewimble on Litecoin. The greatest thing to ever happen to Litecoin

Mimblewimble changes the traditional model of blockchain transactions. It allows for a blockchain to have a more compact history, which is easier and faster to download, synchronize, and verify.

In a MW blockchain, there are no identifiable or reusable addresses, meaning that all transactions look like random data to an outsider. The transaction data is only visible to their respective participants.

So, a Mimblewimble block looks like one large transaction rather than a combination of many. This means that blocks can be verified and confirmed, but they give no details about each transaction. There is no way to link individual inputs with their respective outputs. This is a real problem currently, for instance, if you are a business that wants to do payroll in Bitcoin/Litecoin etc, your employees could deduce who was being paid how much through some clever analysis of the public blockchain.

Hate for Litecoin has grown over the years, but you cannot deny that this is what crypto needs to be successful. Monero will be sweating, Zcash will be sweating. Bitcoin will be sweating. Make no mistake, the implementation of mimblewimble into LTC will be a very big deal.

For example, if $1USD in 2022 is worth 50¬¢ in 2020USD, then will Bitcoin hit 200K and ETH hit $20K instead of the frequently memed 100K and 10K? Or will we just hit these psychological targets at the peak of the run despite the fact that they are only equivalent to $50K and $5K in 2020 dollars?

Long winded, pointless, and self centered post, but too bad because I am going to share it anyway. 
 I am entitled to a selfish shitpost once in a while too.

It doesn't take much to allow tunnel vision to creep in and to unknowingly become stuck in the moment.  It's easy to just ""move on"" and take things for granted.  I think it helps to take a step back every now and then and re-live how we got here.  I've been doing that today and I am going to share just pieces of the last few months lest we'd be tempted to forget.

One of the reasons why I log and share my thoughts is that it helps create a timeline and a narrative which I can revisit later.  Yes some of it is cringe worthy now but I think it is still a fun exercise to look back.

----------

&gt;Still very long since $153. I think the mid term risk to reward is much better on ETH than BTC... I firmly believe that very little is ""priced in"" for ETH. What is coming has been something we have been waiting for for many years. During the last run, the crypto space was almost entirely dominated by Bitcoin. Now more then ever Ethereum defines the very identity of crypto.

.

&gt;I'd be sweating bullets shorting here at 170.

.

&gt; ETH has a lot of value that is under appreciated at $185. Buying here is not wrong or reckless/FOMO

.

&gt;Very notable shift in strength for ETH. I wonder if people are still just too afraid to believe in this move.

That was ~4 months ago.  People were still numb.  Eth had no business being $90 again.  Many were still very skeptical of the gradual climb from the low 100's. But in just two months Eth had doubled from the low 100's to the low 200's. 

But as usual, it wasn't going to be that easy.  For one month we tossed and turned fighting to keep 200.  Sentiment went negative again very quickly.  With each test of 200, many wondered if they should take some of the recovery and run while others were smugly claiming how they sold everything in the low 200's and were going to buy back in at the low 100's.  May was not an easy month.


&gt;Going out on a limb here but I think this ETH move hasn't really started (as weird as that sounds going from 170-215).

.

&gt;Went full position long on this dump at 202.

.

&gt;We were at $140 a month ago. We'll be ok.

.

&gt;Not giving up. The bears are wrong. Added to position at 194. All in. Come get me.

üôÑ Ok maybe I was a little too passionate hah

&gt;Held strong against the onslaught and now nauseatingly long at $194 with a stiff drink in hand.

&gt;If you are waking up and feeling down after seeing the price at 204 then you are missing what just happened. The retest of 200 was going to happen and given the current global environment and the stock market dump; everyone was jumping ship. The floor was about to fall out. We came so close to losing this up trend and going back into the bear market grind.

&gt;But it held. It held despite significant downward pressure. Anticipating a move towards $300 soon once Bitcoin gets back over there 1hr 100MA.

Ya that $300 comment got a lot of laughs and some nasty DMs.

&gt;Everyone is expecting this all to breakdown and fall apart. Every other comment is ""see you at 150"" or ""I am going to sell now and buy back in later"".

&gt;Y'all are in my way.

&gt;That is not what I am seeing.  As for me, I will be patient. If I am wrong, so be it. But this is why I take profits and wait for the right entry. People were looking back at my $153 and below longs and were saying how ""lucky"" I was. It was really choppy then too. It is choppy now. Just as before at 170, I'd be sweating bullets shorting here at 204.

.

&gt;I caution against the heavy negative and dour bias. You are shorting a coiled spring. This market has been beaten to death for several years. The black swan global pandemic drop to the 3000's/90's was a pivot point.

.

&gt;I can keep my thinking to myself going forward. I am going to continue ignoring the PMs. For those vacillating and inundated with the recent influx of negative opinions; here is a contrary voice to add to the discussion. That is all.

Before you think I was just sloberingly bullish the whole time, I wasn't.  It doesn't take much to have months of margin gains suddenly wiped out in 5 minutes.  I also mentioned warnings/hedge shorts just before the inevitable stop hunt dumps that mysteriously immediately recovered.  I'll skip over those.

Finally at the end of May we broke out of the 210's and the switch flipped to extreme excitement.  This of course came at a bad time.  There were several days of euphoria as we neared 250 and many piled in only to get burned over and over again.  Yet again we were in for suffering.   June and July was going to wear us out with the numerous bounces from 220's to 240's.

Early June:
&gt;Going forward I am going to trade less (for now).
Where do we go from here?

&gt;My basic answer is that it is VERY unclear and directionless right now. 
&gt;Margin positions are very very high risk right now. The risk is much higher than the reward.

But I mentioned 
&gt;I have a 20x from $76 that I am keeping open until ~$360-400. 
I think we will be back at 250 soon.

Of course then the whining and the complaining started as Vechain and Cardano and Nano and whatever else started to make large moves while Eth sat there.  With Eth seemingly stuck below 250, frustration and fatigue was almost worse than at $90.

&gt;The same thing that happened just before the last run to $1400 is about to start. It is an essential and critical indicator: The complaining.

&gt;Either:

&gt;Eth sucks and ""those lazy devs keep delaying making me rich"" and ""waa where my moon""

&gt;or

&gt;Eth hasn't even *remotely* begun to move.

&gt;Choose now and plan accordingly because I promise you this lag will happen again (is already happening). Choose which project has more potential, provides more value to the human race, and is more likely to exist years from now.

I think we lost a lot of people those two months.  But then finally on July 19 ([yellow arrow](https://imgur.com/Uf4NMk4)):

&gt;recently the risk to reward for ETH has shifted favorably into a break to the upside.

&gt;How I am positioned:

&gt;My entire ETH trading stack is now deployed from $232-238 (rare for me)

The rest will soon be history but for years this community suffered and patiently waited.  Years and years holding, supporting, and building a nascent and volatile asset.  With the successful launch of Medalla I raise a glass to toast you all.  An incredible future awaits.

1. What do you think about the short and mid-term impact of the COVID economy on the XRP price? (I'm considering 1-2 years as midterm FYI)

This depends on a lot of unknowns right now.

Chiefly the Feds continued reaction to growing debt defaults in the commercial lending, and consumer lending sectors w/Un-Employment running out and 40% of small businesses bankrupt. 

If the perfect storm occurs and the Fed injects more than $500B we are in a strange place. M3 Money Supply would out strip demand, circulation, and GDP levels if no large entities buy up our debt - which no one will because everyones in the same situation.

Let‚Äôs say that happens - complete currency collapse of the USD with the 66 Countries pegged to it - rest of world follows. It would be the Weimar Republic scenario but on a global scale. 

What could that lead to - a globally accepted reset on payment methods - and or currency. 

Without tinfoil hatting it - Crypto may have a space if all those dominoes fell in terms of replacing Fiat entirely.


2. Is it still (considering all the risks associated with the crypto market as a whole) smart to buy XRP dips and hodl? How long do you foresee until a significant potential break-out?

XRP will experience dips, however its long-term value is a lock once banks have to start using their currency for asset transfers. Ignore the dips, and be patient its rise will be steady and less dramatic then Bitcoin, but it will break out once their tools go full active for asset transfers. 


3. What is your strategy with Crypto hodling during COVID?

I‚Äôm holding Fetch.AI, and XRP leaving the money in there and forgetting about it until I hit my targets an can retrieve my initial investment and ride the profits to the moon eliminating any risk.

4. Any other advice/suggestions? 

Patience in the new age crypto world will serve you well, and bring success. Focusing on short term shifts will just bring stress watch the long-term trend and how it is positioned to be scaled to exceed supply and bring value - if it has that there is a chance to reap rewards in 5 years. The guys who bought in early to Bitcoin and sold at $1,000 are hitting themselves 4 years later - the difference between a thousandare and a millionaire is patience and technical analysis for long-term forecasting.",2020-08-05 11:41:24

&gt; Amaury has a serious problem of collaborating with people

In the end, what's the difference?

A ""good person"" is one who values others.

I don't think Amaury values others. Not sufficiently. Not even close. 

When you Google ""what is a good person"" these are the top two results:

They're just pop-sci, so take them with a grain of salt. But, I suspect you'll find them largely agreeable. And they are not flattering to Amaury.

https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/cutting-edge-leadership/201610/how-can-you-tell-if-you-are-good-person

I've managed many more software teams than Amaury has. I'll tell you right now, I would have fired Amaury years ago. In my opinion, while he's clearly a smart guy, he's toxic to team building.

Now we are witnessing a face off between Amaury, and the rest of the community, which has rallied around Jonathan Toomim. At least in terms of proven character traits, Amaury isn't even in the same league as Jonathan. And the community knows it. Jonathan is, like Amaury, extremely intelligent, but he possesses a character trait that I have never observed in Amaury: humility. Which I consider to be a very high virtue. Jonathan is open minded, sincere, listens to others, gives credit where due, and is sufficiently humble that he doesn't want to be in charge. Which is exactly why he should be. 

BCH - Bitcoin - stands at a precipice. Very soon we're going to have the next test. Is ""consensus money"" doomed to be dominated by the most toxic people in the room? Or will it successfully route around toxic people?

The first test, the Gmax test, was overall a failure.

I'm back to just looking at charts for what they are, feels good to be back with the bulls. I was all setup for altseason and BTC running and what I ""thought"" should happen fucked me up instead of just looking at charts.  

To me it's been all about the dollar and I totally missed [this downtrend channel](https://www.tradingview.com/x/puixs1H6/). If we don't get some crazy market blowup it should trend down, which means Bitcoin goes on a massive run. I'm still cautious because there is a [giant IHS](https://www.tradingview.com/x/xfAmXcoG/) but I think more big stimulus will be pushed through. 

Altcoins broke through the downtrend since 2018 and have amazing setups, we are [at resistance](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ayk2CB8V/) and might get a small pullback but I'll be buying some. 

DXY might get some bullish action soon which would give BTC a small retrace, there is an open BTC gap at 9k something which would be an amazing buy but we might not get there.

g0kewtg,ftrader,7,"BCHN supports and works toward the goals of the common Bitcoin Cash vision that you linked at bitcoincash.org. 

I've stated that commitment in the past.

Additionally, we have [some broader objectives we have set for our project](https://bitcoincashnode.org/en/goals) and when it comes to the work we are doing, we follow a [project plan](https://schedule.bitcoincashnode.org/BCHN-task-detail.html).

As for a ""BCHN roadmap"", by which I would understand a technology roadmap for our project, that is something which we still need to develop. It will take more time, effort and consultation with our user base and the rest of the ecosystem.

The primary needs we are working on as per our initial crowdfunding, are:

- DAA replacement
- improving test networks
- raising unconfirmed chain limits
- ensuring that smart contract script have necessary mathematical operations

Then there are other technologies we feel will help to scale Bitcoin Cash and make it a better &amp; more useful for of money. These too will require additional sponsorship (read: crowdfunding) and devolved leadership (finding people to champion their development). We've mentioned many or all of these in our Flipstarter proposal:

- Fast, secure and more compatible API connections (this includes using better network transport protocols)
- Double Spend Proofs and Notifications
- UTXO/UtreeXO commitments
- Better block propagation with compatible Xthinner and/or Graphene
- Better multi-processing (enabling use of all processing cores during block validation)
- Adaptive blocksize limit proposals (to replace fixed limit)
- Pre-consensus options (we are open to evaluating Storm and Avalanche)
- Extending capability of smart contract features
- Improving the transaction format

As an open source community-driven project, we rely heavily on not only community funding but also working with engaged developers who want to see these items realized.

We are fortunate to enjoy good collaboration with other projects and independent developers in the Bitcoin Cash space.",2020-08-06 23:48:20

Everyone under $100k is lucky to buy bitcoin that cheap. Buy and hold for several years, you will always profit. 

Bitcoin is young for a currency, only 12 years, but look how big it already is!

12 years is a long time for tech to be proven. Bitcoin has never been stronger, more secure, or bigger, in hashrate, new wallets and second layer solutions. If bitcoin would have died, it already would have. It's only getting bigger and stronger.

Look what the FED and other central banks are doing, printing trillions. Bitcoin gets more recognition everyday, it is fighting for its spot next to silver and gold. And winning, too. If it grows as much as the market cap of gold, around 9 trillion or so, it's said 1 btc would be around $350k - $500k. Give it time and it will outgrow gold in market cap, that's what I think, there is lot of room to grow.

Go all in, I would do the same! 

Look up these people to educate yourself. Start with Andreas Antonopolous, great beginners serie on YouTube, and google these great people: Gigi, Robert Breedlove, Dan Held, PlanB, Knut Svanholm and I am sure you'll get a great amount of fascinating links, bitcoin is never boring!

The cycle next to this one will bring us close to (half?) a million dollar bitcoin, and we'll still be only just starting..

Good luck! Wish I had the same fiat to spend, I can assure you, I would go all in. I already am all in, but would do the same again, also with that amount of fiat! 

Keep us updated in a few years!

Still in regular contact with the exec responsible for our capital markets side since, he's a convert and sends me emails with blockchain news :)  


Starting on a presentation to give an update to people, been a couple of years since I did one to a wider audience so can r/ethfinance help me out?  


Topics I have so far:  


* Market Conditions ‚Äì End of the bear market?
* Institutional Adoption ‚Äì Bitcoin CMEs, Banks, Rating Agencies, Exchanges, Institutional FOMO?
* Derivatives ‚Äì Huge rise in demand since 2017
* DeFi ‚Äì Decentralised Finance and the rise of decentralised derivatives

You skip this part as if it's not important and we can work it out later AFTER we all agree to IFP. 

But why should we? 

I say we must know this BEFORE we agree to it. 

We already have a system that takes our money and distributes it ""wisely"" (called ""taxation""), but even then the government publishes the detailed budget for the next year, quarter, etc... And it still sucks, you just know that this money is nowhere close to 100% effectiveness, that you money is going to fund a war or prisons or something you didn't agree to.

Now **imagine** a different situation - one where ABC comes out in January and tells people: 

&gt; Hey everybody, we have a proposal to collect some funds and use them to develop Bitcoin Cash further. This is a very preliminary idea, so we're totally open to feedback, let's discuss it.

&gt; We want to collect $5.5M over the next 6 months and we plan to use it for the following:

&gt; 1) Hire 2 scientists ($250,000/year each max) for one year to help us research possibility to deploy Avalanche

&gt; 2) Hire 2 additional C++ developers ($200,000/year each max) to help us backporting stuff from Bitcoin Core - they are releasing a ton of stuff and we need to merge it, this blocks our important work

&gt; 3) Lead developers salary: Amaury ($200,000/year), Anthony ($200,000/year) - discussable, but that's about what they could get on open market

&gt; 4) Buy better hardware (4 iMacs, 2 MacBooks) for lead developers - about $20,000, this will speed up the development

&gt; 5) Hire a PR guy to improve our communications with public, because Amaury is better used in other place ($75,000)

....

&gt; 33) We want to have additional $100,000 buffer just in case we missed something somewhere in our calculations (that's about 2% of total amount)

&gt; Any money left over (if we manager to hire people cheaper or some plans are cancelled as not possible) will be kept and we'll open a discussion on how to better use it.

&gt; This is a total of $5.5M. We have contacted some miners and they are willing to donate $500K, we have contacted Roger Ver and Marc de Mesel, they are ready to donate $1M more, but we're still $3M short for our plan.

&gt; One of the ideas that we have thought about, was to make a hard fork where 3.5% of miners coinbase will go to ABC for 6 months, that would be exactly $3M we're missing. This will drop our hashrate 3.5% for 6 months, but will allow us to build this incredible thing. We understand that it's a serious issue and we want to hear some ideas on how should we proceed.

Then in March a community builds a Flipstarter and ABC collects maybe $300K more. After that they go to the community and talk about how all current options are exhausted and we need to seriously think about IFP.

I can guarantee that the reaction to THIS approach would have been totally different than to ""12.5% to HK corp. everything is already decided, the deal is done, k thx bye!""",2020-08-09 03:41:29

ETH is a better SOV with eth2 because it‚Äôs issuance will be less than Bitcoin‚Äôs for about 10 years at 0.5%, and fee burning under EIP 1559 can make that issuance rate go lower, potentially negative.

The *real* important thing beyond that, imo, is that people will want ETH for reasons other than simple belief that it‚Äôs a SOV. At minimum it is the security mechanism of the network that is an income generating asset through staking. Then factor in DeFi and other income generating uses and *now* you have a real SOV that mirrors gold and commodities a bit more realistically.

g0xqsr2,Zizaerion,3,"The difference between the bitcoin derived apps and other coins/apps besides, is that the isolation with the non bitcoin derivatives is enforced using the firmware.  In the bitcoin and bitcoin derived coins case, that couldn't be done due to the numerous bitcoin forks that took place.  Other native coins haven't suffered the amount of forks that bitcoin did.  u/My1xT is correct in saying that the apps for different coins are coded to use different signature formats.  The U2F app for example, can't sign a bitcoin transaction because it doesn't have the code to be able to do so.  The apps which run on the device are open source, so anyone can audit the code.  When apps are running, they can't see the seed and that's enforced by the firmware.  They only thing they can do is ask the firmware to generate a key pair, which is what happens for all the coin apps, but also the U2F and openpgp card app.  Then those apps have the remaining code to process those individual key pairs that were generated for whatever purposes the app is used for.",2020-08-10 07:40:52

Actually looking at the date, it's possible that the version of Bitcoin at the time didn't even have the next 100 keys generated -- the first handful of versions required you to back up your `wallet.dat` **after each transaction**.

When I first started following bitcoin back then I was shocked at how error-prone the design was, and am still surprised it took so many years to get deterministic wallet seeds.

Private keys are what control your Bitcoin holdings.  If you do not hold your keys, you do not hold your coins.  All web wallets do *not* let *you* hold the keys, the website operator holds the keys, thus are ""custodial"" and if *they* are hacked, or ""hacked"" (i.e. inside job from a disgruntled employee, or even the golden parachute of the founders of the website), you could lose all your coins.

The proper thing to do is to hold your own keys on your own hardware that you control yourself.

You can do this with an ordinary laptop or desktop or phone (e.g. just download Electrum); this is hardware you control yourself, after all, you can run with a laptop or phone or move house with your desktop, so all the data stored therein is yours in much the same way the hardware is yours.  The problem is that general-purpose computers like laptops and desktops and phones are easy to hack especially if it does not run GNU/Linux, and especially since they are usually 100% online when they are turned on.

A hardware wallet is a dedicated very low-power computer, which specifically does not connect online.  The things they can do are very limited: they can only sign transactions, and only if you physically press a button on the hardware wallet to authorize it.  Because of the limited scope of what they can do, they are very much harder to hack online.

Note that hardware wallets are still vulnerable if somebody is able to acquire physical access to them (specialized hackers can use standard electronics lab equipment to extract private keys from it).  But then: possession is 9/10 of the law, and that applies here as well, so keeping the wallet physically secure is still necessary.  The important thing is that hardware wallets greatly reduce the scope of remote online attacks.",2020-08-12 11:49:24

g16nrjn,Doc-Engineer,7,"They can't just ""run a script"" though, that's not really how it works. The few times law enforcement has managed to track Bitcoin transactions across addresses was because they were able to follow the BTC amount rather than the addresses, because they were unique, large-sized transactions. If tumbling services are compromised by hackers that's not a great sign, but it sounds like Tor has been buckling down to fix that as of May when they were alerted. Either way, the only time any link to me actually comes up it's encrypted with the buyers public key, so unless they perform a sting that I actually decide to buy from (unlikely because I use the same few trusted vendors who have been around forever on multiple markets), they would be hard pressed to collect my identity for any reasonable cost to them. Tails alone is hard as shit to trace and destroys all the evidence as soon as the flash disk is pulled, with the exception of the encrypted private message with my address sent to the trusted vendor, and the anonymous BTC transactions.

It also helps to use public WiFi that doesn't block .onion routing along with that MAC spoof. Then even if they do trace the network responsible for the BTC transactions they won't know who it was, unless I got caught on video like a dumb shit.

**My dream list of 2023:**

1. ETH

2. Bitcoin

3. DAI - the native permissionless stablecoin for DeFi

4. USDC - Probably the most trustworthy bet if I had to hold $1 million in any stable coin for the next 10 years. I love DAI but over a long time scale, a project build on smart contracts which have only been deployed for a few years is high risk.

5. LINK - I think it might deserve to be a little bit further down the list at the moment until their oracles become truly decentralised.

6. MKR - Someone needs to govern all that DAI!

7. - 10. Mixture of Dexes (COMP, KNC, AAVE etc), interoperability and infrastructure tokens like RLC or REN (If BTC is no. 2 then this could be huge). I could also see Polkadot being in here. Not because I think it will come close to killing ETH but rather because they are focusing on interoperability which is exactly how to survive in an ETH dominated world. If you can't beat 'em join 'em. I can definitely see polkadot carving its own little niche in the comig years and its interoperability with ETH will put it ahead of Charles Hoscoinson chain and ""The Ethereum of [insert asian nation here]"" chains.

**Note:** I didn't include Monero because I would hope that more substantial privacy tech has been implemented by 2022 on Ethereum. Also, I can't see privacy coins keeping up with other coins in the long run because their target market is only so big.

**Note 2:** This is a pipe dream. The top 10 will never look like this since  ETH and BTC competitors/forks will always be overpriced due to speculation on them overtaking ETH/BTC 

**Note 3:** Yes I put Bitcoin at number 2. 21 million hard cap is super memeable and very compelling as we enter a world of [brrr](https://brrr.money/) and another selling point is that it would be superior to gold in a not too distant future where asteroid gold threatens the dominance of gold as a store of value asset.

Until this ecosystem can get going on proof of stake I can understand why people want Bitcoin to succeed. But after that it's game on. All of the shity narratives on Twitter. All of the shity tribalism bullshit we've endured over the last three years of this bear Market have taken its toll.

Ethereum is at a point in 2021-2022 that it can succeed without Bitcoin and the sooner people realize that the better. If you don't believe me just watch what happens with the Three Gorges Dam in China if that Levee Breaks. 

 This isn't political mumbo jumbo or whatever you want to call it. If proof of stake comes around the corner then it will definitely be an even footing worldwide for people to participate regardless of electricity costs or environmental impact.

The liquidity flood will end. Sooner or later, the government's got to start paying for them-- some of these stimulus for some of the deficits, for some of the well-deserved, very smart subsidies that it's providing to people.""

GEORGE BALL:¬†Jamie's at least a partial convert. I'm not sure that he's a total convert. And then the notion isn't to hide or to seek a tax refuge but to have something that can't be undermined by the government, and it won't become worthless if the currency becomes worthless or at least if enough Robinhooders happen to believe that.

There's no yields today. And so Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency becomes a very attractive either long term, I want to make a safe haven for my money or a short-term speculative bet.

Furthermore, the ownership base of Bitcoin is a vanishingly small percentage of the total addressable market. The anticipation of new entrants into the market and thus increased future demand further reinforces this expectation of Bitcoin's increased purchasing power. 

However, as Bitcoin is more widely adopted, this ownership base will continue to grow up until a point where there are very few new entrants into the market. The absence of new demand will cause a plateau in Bitcoin's price level, the degree to which holders anticipate an increase in their purchasing power will diminish, and their propensity to save will be marginally shifted toward consumption.

&gt;*‚ÄúCryptocurrency‚Äôs promise is to make money and payments universally accessible‚Äì to anyone, no matter where they are in the world.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The Decentralized Finance (DeFi) or Open Finance movement takes that promise a step further. Imagine a global, open alternative to¬†every¬†financial service you use today ‚Äî savings, loans, trading, insurance and more ‚Äî accessible to anyone in the world with a smartphone and internet connection.‚Äù* \[Source\]  
&gt;  
&gt;DeFi has evolved substantially over the past couple of years.  
&gt;  
&gt;No longer is it limited to simple lending / borrowing with over collateralisation on Ethereum.  
&gt;  
&gt;Synthetic assets have exploded in popularity.  
&gt;  
&gt;These are tokens pegged to legacy assets such as fiat currencies, metals and commodities.  
&gt;  
&gt;Others represent native blockchain assets such as Bitcoin or other tokens.  
&gt;  
&gt;While DeFi is possible on other blockchains, Ethereum is dominating this space.  
&gt;  
&gt;There is more Bitcoin ‚Äúwrapped‚Äù into the Ethereum network than Bitcoin‚Äôs own scaling solutions.  
&gt;  
&gt;These advancements have lead to a whole new world of borrowing, lending and derivatives.

&gt;This means that the network will no longer rely on the massive energy cost of ‚Äúmining‚Äù that uses specialised hardware like Bitcoin.  
&gt;  
&gt;Instead it will rely on node owners who lock up Ethereum, using simple software and low cost devices.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ethereum node owners that lock up their ETH are given a reward instead of the miners for processing transactions.  
&gt;  
&gt;Using this method will mean the transaction speed will increase drastically.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;With the layer 2 solutions and Ethereum 2.0, this will deliver the speed and ability to equal and surpass current internet / cloud technologies.  
&gt;  
&gt;For example, Visa does approx. 1,700 transactions per second.  
&gt;  
&gt;Twitter is around 5,700 per second.   
&gt;  
&gt;Ethereum 2.0 without layer 2 solutions will allow 100,000 transactions per second.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ethereum 1.0 is around 15 transactions per second.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The possibilities for what could develop, given what is possible with 15 transactions a second, is hard to quantify.

- Alice with BTC wants to use it on ETH  (for e.g. DeFi)
- People ""on Ethereum"" create a BTC address for Alice
- This will be a kind of vault backed by ETH
- Alice sends her BTC to this vault (BTC address)
- Alice gets wBTC (erc20) in return
- Alice uses wBTC as she wants on Ethereum
- If Alice wants to get BTC again; she trades her wBTC for BTC in the Vault
- wBTC is destroyed 
- BTC is send back to Alice /unlocked on the Bitcoin blockchain

So basically; during all this time the BTC of Alice can not be used on the BTC blockchain. It can only be used on Ethereum; hence ""BTC on Ethereum""",2020-08-16 06:10:56

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/search?q=microstrategy&amp;restrict\_sr=1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/search?q=microstrategy&amp;restrict_sr=1) 

Thats the company that butters were so happy about because they claimed to have bought some bitcoin.

And apparently, its by the far the most expensive domain sale,

&gt; So $30 million for a domain? Yep, that‚Äôs a record by a long shot, topped only by Sex.com for $13 million. It was actually more than $30 million because the buyer, block.one, paid a commission to GoDaddy. 

And whats weird is that honestly I felt that we are well past the whole dot com high valuation phase.

Just look at the domains sold recently before that. All huge sales, but barely 10% of [Voice.com](https://Voice.com).

Something else interesting about MicroStrategy:

&gt;The company reported earnings this afternoon. It had net income of $20.4 million, or $1.98 per share on a diluted basis. After paying taxes, it netted $21.8 million on Voice.com.  
&gt;  
&gt;Take out the domain name sale and MicroStrategy had a net loss for the second quarter of $1.4 million, or $0.14 per share.

g1v2613,BigBlockIfTrue,9,"# [Release Notes for Bitcoin Cash Node version 22.0.0](https://docs.bitcoincashnode.org/doc/release-notes/release-notes-22.0.0/)

Bitcoin Cash Node version 22.0.0 is now available from:

  &lt;https://bitcoincashnode.org&gt;


## Overview

This is a major release of Bitcoin Cash Node that implements the
[November 15, 2020 Network Upgrade](https://upgradespecs.bitcoincashnode.org/2020-11-15-upgrade/).
This will upgrade the difficulty targeting used in Bitcoin Cash to a
commonly agreed new algorithm called ASERT.

Additionally, this version contains many corrections and improvements.

User who are running any of our previous releases (0.21.x) are urged to
upgrade to v22.0.0 well ahead of November 2020.


## Usage recommendations

The update to Bitcoin Cash Node 22.0.0 is required for the November 15, 2020
Bitcoin Cash network upgrade.


## Semantic version numbering

As of version 22.0.0, Bitcoin Cash Node uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for its version numbers.
Hence our version numbers no longer start with a zero.

Semantic versioning makes it easy to tell from the change in version
number what are the impacts on interfaces and backward compatibility:

- A major version (first number) change indicates that an interface changed
in a way that makes the new software incompatible with older releases.

- A minor version change indicates added functionality that is backwards
compatible.

- A patch version (third number) change indicates that a new release only
contains bug fixes which are backward compatible.


## Network changes

### Changes to automatic banning

Automatic banning of peers for bad behavior has been slightly altered:

- Automatic bans are now referred to as ""discouraged"" in log output, as
  they're not (and weren't even before) strictly banned: incoming connections
  are still allowed from them (as was the case before this change), but they're
  preferred for eviction.

- Automatic bans will no longer time-out automatically after 24 hours.
  Depending on traffic from other peers, automatic bans may time-out at an
  indeterminate time.

- Automatic bans will no longer be persisted across restarts. Only manual bans
  will be persisted.

- Automatic bans will no longer be returned by the `listbanned` RPC.

- Automatic bans can no longer be lifted with the `setban remove` RPC command.
  If you need to remove an automatic ban, you must clear all automatic bans with
  the `clearbanned false true` RPC command, or restart the software to clear
  automatic bans.

- All extant automatic bans (""node misbehaving"") that are currently stored in the
  node's `banlist.dat` file will be converted into ""manual bans"" and will expire
  within 24 hours after first running this version of BCHN.


### Regtest network now requires standard transactions by default

The regression test chain, that can be enabled by the `-regtest` command line
flag, now requires transactions to not violate standard policy by default.
Making the default the same as for mainnet, makes it easier to test mainnet
behavior on regtest. Be reminded that the testnet still allows non-standard
txs by default and that the policy can be locally adjusted with the
`-acceptnonstdtxn` command line flag for both test chains.


### Graceful expiration of this version on May 15, 2021

A mechanism has been added to this version such that it will gracefully
expire on May 15, 2021, at the time of the network upgrade which is
tentatively scheduled to occur then. Once this software expires, the RPC
subsystem will disallow RPC commands. This feature can be disabled with
the `-expire=0` option. Furthermore, the date of expiration can be altered
with the `-tachyonactivationtime=&lt;n&gt;` option.

This feature has been added as a safety measure to prevent this version of
the node software from mining or otherwise transacting on an incompatible
chain, should an upgrade take place on May 15th, 2021. This version will begin
to warn via RPC ""warnings"", via a GUI message, and via periodic messages to the
log starting 30 days prior to May 15th, 2021.

Once the future consensus rules of the May 15th, 2021 upgrade to the Bitcoin
Cash network have been determined, a new version of Bitcoin Cash Node will be
made available well in advance of May 15th, 2021. It is recommended that all
users of Bitcoin Cash Node update their nodes at that time so as to ensure
uninterrupted operation.

*Related configuration options:*

- `-expire`: Specify `expire=0` in the configuration file or `-expire=0`
on the CLI to disable the aforementioned graceful expiration mechanism
(default: 1).

- `-tachyonactivationtime=&lt;n&gt;`: This option controls when the expiration
mechanism (if enabled) will expire the node and disable RPC (&lt;n&gt; seconds since
epoch, default: 1621080000).


## Deprecated functionality

### Autotools build system

The autotools build system (`autogen`, `configure`, ...) is deprecated and
will be removed in a future release. CMake is the replacement build system,
look at the documentation for the build instructions. To continue using the
autotools build system, pass the --enable-deprecated-build-system flag to
`configure`.

### CashAddr enabled by default in bitcoin-tx

The bitcoin-tx tool has fully supported CashAddr since v0.21.2. CashAddr in JSON
output was disabled by default, but relying on this default was deprecated.
Version 22.0.0 now changes the default to enabled. Specify `-usecashaddr=0` to
retain the old behavior.


## Removed functionality

### `medianfeerate` field removed from `getblockstats`

The `medianfeerate` field in `getblockstats` output has been removed. The 50th
percentile from the `feerate_percentiles` array should be used instead.

### `-datacarrier` removed

The bitcoind/bitcoin-qt option `-datacarrier` was deprecated in v0.21.2 and has
now been removed in v22.0.0. Instead, use the existing option `-datacarriersize`
to control relay and mining of OP_RETURN transactions, e.g. specify
`-datacarriersize=0` to reject them all.

### BIP9 support removed

Bitcoin Cash Node 22.0.0 removed the (incomplete) BIP9 support. In earlier
versions, it already was inactive due to no available proposals to vote on. The
empty `softforks` field in `getblockchaininfo` has been removed.

### Prototypical Avalanche removed

The Avalanche prototype features have been removed from this release
pending specification and evaluation.

### Windows 32-bit build removed

The 32-bit Windows target is no longer supported and has been removed from
the release shipment.

Users that wish to build for 32 bits Windows should be aware that
this will not be tested by the Bitcoin Cash Node team and be prepared to
resolve issues on their own.


## New RPC methods

No changes.


## Low-level RPC changes

- The `sigops` and `sigoplimit` values returned by the `getblocktemplate`
  and `getblocktemplatelight` methods are now calculated according to the
  SigChecks specification.

- The `clearbanned` method now optionally can take two additional boolean
  arguments (both default to true if unspecified). These arguments can be used
  to control whether manual or automatic bans are to be cleared (or both).

- The `listbanned` method no longer lists automatic bans.

- The `listbanned` method's results array has changed slightly. All entries
  now have their `banned_reason` as ""manually added"" (since `listbanned` can
  now only ever show manual bans). The ""node misbehaving"" value for this key
  will never appear. This key is now deprecated and may be removed altogether
  in a future release of BCHN.

- The `setban` method can no longer lift individual automatic bans. Use
  `clearbanned` instead to clear all bans, or `clearbanned false true` to
  clear all automatic bans (while preserving all manual bans).

Chart:  [Point and Figure Chart for $BTC](https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/pnf.php?c=%24BTCUSD,PWTADANRNO[PA][D][F1!3!!!2!20])

(Chart at 13:15 EDT, with the price at 11,844.

I know it feels like we are stuck on a hamster wheel again, but it is merely a consolidation period.

As much as the gains over the last few days are exciting, in the grand scheme of things it is merely noise.  If you take a look at the chart you will see that we are well within the recently established trading range.  That range goes from 11,150 up to 11,950.  

The formation we are in right now is 10 columns wide, which is getting a little wider than normal over the past year or so.  The attempts at 12,000 and above have been pushed back pretty harshly.  But that is to be expected as we grow into areas with much thinner air.  

I tend to think of the 15k-20k range as not really reflecting ATH pressures as we really spent a small amount of time in those ranges.  The rocket from 17k to 20k took about 48 hours if I recall.  That is not exactly a process of consolidation.  

So, I think we stay in our current range from 11,250 to 11,950  for a little more diddling around.  Keep in mind that as long as we stay in this formation, the ‚Äúexplosive‚Äù nature of the move up (or down) is being magnified.  The consolidation that is demonstrated by the width of the formation (how many columns across at its widest, unbroken point) should be considered a spring.  With each new column within the formation, that spring is turned one more time.  As any elementary school student knows that the tighter you wind a spring, the more tension is released when it is unleashed.  

That pattern is common for bitcoin.  We should see another move fairly soon (days, not hours or minutes.). When it happens, and the price rises above 12,000 look for the ‚Äúwidth‚Äù of the formation count (11 wide if it goes up) would be added to the break out price‚Äîgiving you a price target in the next 30 days of about $550 dollars above the breakout.  That's nothing to sneeze at.

In the mean time, we could decline to the 11,250 point of the range without losing much sleep.  If you were shorting from these areas I would start looking to close out at a price above 11,250 with most of the trade.

Price was higher for about 40 days back end of 2017. Most of that was a dead cat bounce. 

Maybe 3 areas of resistance looking at the 3 day https://i.imgur.com/STLz2Dv.png

Bull case is over next few months price gets bought up to ATH and then in 2021 we see if the stock to flow model holds true and price hits $100,000

2 weeks till a new monthly candle. If it opens above $13,900 that will be highest ever. https://i.imgur.com/r3D7O82.png above $14,000-$20,000 will be interesting to see the resistance. 

Say 100 world wide companies / hedge funds want to put $250,000,000 each into Bitcoin. At $30,000 that buys 8333 Bitcoins. Which is 9.25 days worth of Bitcoin mined. Those 100 companies buy up 925 days worth of Bitcoins mined if price is at $30,000. 

Lets say there are 15,000,000 active Bitcoins. 1% of the world buys in which is 75 million people. If they all buy 0.2 BTC that is 15 million BTC bought. 0.2 BTC at $100,000 is $20,000. Basically just get 75 million people to set up an automatic $100 Bitcoin buy for each week and leave it for 4 years. 

I think Bitcoin is a giant snowball just getting bigger as more people buy in. The bigger the money that Bitcoin attracts the less people is needed to buy up millions of Bitcoins. 30 millionaires buy 0.5 Bitcoin. There are 47 millionaires in the world and 2,825 billionaires.",2020-08-18 13:56:47

Due to the ETH 2.0 hype, I can see the ratio getting back above 0.1 for a few weeks or months before falling back down for a few months when Bitcoin takes the spotlight off ETH as it pushes past 20K. A ratio of 0.1 would put us at almost $2K. Otherwise, a ratio of 0.07 would put us at ATH the same time as BTC. I could see this happening too since there will be strong resistance for ETH at $1,400.

g1xdwig,Peng_Fei,16,"I just finished listening to the \`Bitcoin vs Ethereum\` with Samsom Mow and Vitalik Buterin podcast by Peter McCormack, Here are my thoughts on it all.

&amp;#x200B;

Not everyone will agree with my opinions, and I'm not expecting for everyone to do so. That being said, I believe that in the short-medium term, Bitcoin will continue to dominate the crypto markets. It's well known, has a solid goal/vision of being a store of value and people trust it as hard money. What Bitcoin excels at, Ethereum falls behind in. Ethereum on the other-hand is well established as the go to Smart Contract platform to develop on, with a work in progress Monetary Policy. I believe this is the correct approach as well, as the Ethereum blockchain continues to innovate and be the place to build Smart Contracts on. What I want out of Ethereum though for it's long term goal is to finalize it's blockchain technology,  develop an acceptable scalable solution on the base layer and perform less tinkering with it's base layer over time. Afterwards, continue to cement ETH the asset as the store of value for the new digital economy. Whether it be through stablecoins backed by ETH, staking, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout the podcast, Samsom would throw slight jabs at Vitalik for things like the DAO hack back in 2016; Vitaliks statements on the internet of money shouldn't have transaction costs more than 5 cents; or how easy it is for scammers to thrive on the Ethereum blockchain. While we all agree that the rollback of the chain is something we will never agree to again, we cannot fault Ethereum as a whole due to one event. In fact, it was brought up during the podcast that Bitcoin had a similar situation of having to rollback it's chain due to an inflation bug. Bitcoiners tend to shrug this off as not being similar to the DAO situation, when in fact they are one in the same. Samson also brought up that Vitalik has this centralized control over the development of Ethereum through his statements on Twitter. This is blatantly false, while Vitalik can and should have his own opinions on the future of Ethereum, ultimately the future of Ethereum is up to the community and this community can listen to Vitalik, or shrug off his statements. Samson also brought up that there are constant hacks on Ethereum, but this statement too is false. Ethereum the blockchain has not been hacked, and Ethereum doesn't scam people. The truth is, Ethereum allows it's community to do whatever it is they please , it doesn't discriminate. In fact, all of the scams and hacks mentioned by Samson, are possible on top of Bitcoin as well, all it takes is for someone to develop an application that gains traction. I don't feel Vitalik during the podcast defended Ethereum well enough . 

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, I at the moment do not see ETH as a SoV, but I treat ETH as a SoV, and I see a future where ETH can be a SoV for the new digital economy so long as we help build and cement ETH's monetary policy which in due time, will be a reality. The Ethereum blockchain will continue to be the #1 Smart Contract platform, and with ETH 2.0 on the horizon, it will cement it's place even further.

1. Bitcoin pushes upwards, altcoins sit back and watch.

2. Bitcoin moves sideways, investors get impatient and look for gains elsewhere, altcoins pump.

3. Bitcoin pulls back significantly, altcoins do too, often pulling back harder.

Note: Individual alts will move at different times. If you make 5x gains on one coin but another has only gone up 10-50% in that time, it's probably a good time to move some profits into the alts which are still going to pump.

Note 2: The above phases can happen in any order multiple times over in a bull run.

What do you want? What are your values? If you‚Äôre net worth hits 8 figures before your 35, are you happier? 

We‚Äôre the same age. I‚Äôm a high earning, hard working engineer and I‚Äôve put in the long hours and grueling work that I thought would make all my dreams come true. I compared myself to my engineering-school peers: the girl who is already a director of product development, the guy who created some algorithm for trading stocks and sold it for a song, and the idiot who was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and had made it into an entirely gold flatware set. 

The reality of modern capitalism is that hard work doesn‚Äôt correlate to more money and more net worth. 

I was hospitalized with a respiratory infection in 2017 because I was too busy to take care of myself. I couldn‚Äôt take the time off to see my doctor when I was feeling under the weather, but once my lungs filled with fluid, I ended up in the ICU for a week on high flow oxygen trying to prevent permanent brain damage. I was out of work for 2 months, I broke ribs from coughing, and I wasn‚Äôt 100% for about 8 months. 

I pushed myself and jumped back in. I forced myself as if my illness was just another obstacle I could obliterate and prove that I was the best. 

Then I was the best, I was getting the most important projects, tons of praise, and put in front of our client and executive management. I got a promotion and a big raise. I was the golden girl and I was fucking miserable. I was in the office all day, I was so exhausted, I was stopping by Whole Foods and paying too much for dinner and downing a bottle of wine almost every night. I had insomnia and I never was not thinking about work. 

And then I got sick again. Now I was bleeding internally and I was having panic attacks on my 2 mile commute. I was driving my family and friends away, my husband couldn‚Äôt figure out how to help me without offending me and my ambition. I started losing my shit in the bathroom and then began openly crying at my desk. 

I was (and am) Financially Independent. My husband and I set our life and living expenses up based on just one salary. We had a solid emergency fund. I am privileged, both of my own making and the situation I was born into. 

So I YOLO quit in January. I told my boss I quit and that I would be happy to onboard the next engineer over the next two weeks. Word got out that I wasn‚Äôt leaving for another job; I was leaving because I hated it there. I got mixed reactions, but most were jealous. Most didn‚Äôt have the options I have. They begged me to stay, and I slept for the first time in months when I told the Big Boss that there was no title nor amount of money that would change my mind. 

I took about 6 weeks off with no agenda. I went to check out the cute coffee shops I never had the time for. I painted! I read books! I hung out with my mom! I cooked and exercised! I did all the shit I always wanted to do if I didn‚Äôt work. 

In February, I had 3 job in offers and I accepted one that was 10% more than what I had been making. I started there a few weeks before COVID and I love it. I intentionally drew boundaries about how long I would work and my new company respected them. 

Where am I going with this... I believe that financial independence is first and foremost because it gives you peace of mind along the journey. Get your emergency fund and set your life up WELL within your means so you can weather the storm. Retiring Early is not guaranteed, even if you have billions in net worth. Bitcoin guy and director girl could get cancer or hit by a car then who really gives a shit how much money they were worth. If you decide to live in a cardboard box until you‚Äôre 40 then retire, that is up to you and your values. For me, my shitty job and health made me realize that I want to go out with my husband to nice dinners. I want to wear clothes that fit and make me feel good. I want to pay for the AC because it‚Äôs hot as balls in my apartment. 

My values are to spend the time I have with my loved ones. That‚Äôs why I choose to be Financially Independent.",2020-08-19 11:33:14

TL;DR: ""We don't like Ethereum. It's dangerous for its users because millions of dollars have been lost to contract bugs and scams and you don't warn people about these risks.""

Ultimately, risk management in finance is up to the individual investor. People shouldn't be guided and told what to invest in like they are children if they don't want to be. I think this is one of the things Vitalik mean't when he said Ethereum is freedom. Ethereum is the grown-up's world of finance to traditional finance's walled playground for children. You can do whatever you can dream of in Ethereum but nobody is going to help you if you fall off the jungle jims. Bitcoin created their own walled playground separate from the traditional system but now that true financial freedom was created with Ethereum, they find this world too scary (or they pretend this is the case) so they warn everyone how dangerous it is and instead tell everyone to join them in their own walled off playground which is even more limiting than traditional finance.

Also, with ETH, progress is being made toward a pretty big milestone, Proof of Stake.  This  leads eventually to scaling gains, and in the shorter term, it turns ETH into an income-producing asset.  And all that is happening as corporate adoption is soaring and DeFi is taking off.

Add to that the Federal Reserve money printer and that ETH could act as a hedge against inflation, and you have a perfect storm brewing for an ATH.",2020-08-19 06:00:46

Ultimately the number doesn't matter too much as the market will price in the supply and demand. What matters is the fact that there is a limit, there is scarcity that is open , predictable , and agreed upon beforehand and not manipulated by corrupt Central planners like fiat or some altcoins (even popular ones) do.

-------------------

&gt; what kind of economy would it create?

Bitcoin in this sense is a bit of an experiment and is already disproving some incorrect economic assumptions suggested by Keynesian economists, namely the fear-mongering of the ""deflationary death spiral"" where the opposite has occurred during periods of high appreciation/deflation. More spending and charitable giving occurs during these times. 

We will see in time , but my general sense is that Bitcoin will become more stable and less volatile with a higher market cap and more liquidity and encourage more saving, more conscientious consumerism and longer term investing, and wiser use of capital.

&gt;Lets say the population has grown substantially without enough bitcoin to go around

What most people miss is that the overhead of saturation is enormous compared to established technologies. The saturation for newcomers to the crypto market has barely scratched the surface.

g26dr6n,bitusher,6,"&gt;heard anyone explain why the cap is set at 21 million. Rather than 19 or 35.

Some educated guesses why satoshi chose 21 million-

1) One theory is that at the time of Satoshi‚Äôs decision to use 21 million as the finite number of Bitcoin, the global M1 money supply stood at approximately $21 trillion. In economics, this is the global money supply that includes physical currency and coins, demand deposits, traveller's checks, other checkable deposits

2) ‚ÄúI wanted to pick something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but without knowing the future, that‚Äôs very hard. I ended up picking something in the middle,‚Äù Nakamoto said. ‚ÄúIf Bitcoin remains a small niche,‚Äù he added, ‚Äúit‚Äôll be worth less per unit than existing currencies. If you imagine it being used for some fraction of world commerce, then there‚Äôs only going to be 21 million coins for the whole world, so it would be worth much more per unit.‚Äù

3)  Some believe that Bitcoin‚Äòs 21 million limit was arbitrarily set by Nakamoto when he made two key decisions. That Bitcoin should add new blocks to its blockchain every 10 minutes (on average) and that the reward paid to miners halves every 210,000 blocks ‚Äì roughly every 4 years.

4) ""A total of 174,100 tonnes of gold have been mined in human history, according to GFMS as of 2012.2 This is roughly equivalent to 5.6 billion troy ounces or, in terms of volume, about 9261 m3, or a cube **21.0 m on a side**.""

5) 50x210,000(1+1/2+1/4+1/8+1/16....) or 

50*210,000(2) = 21,000,000 is a nice clean equation to code and mathematically concise 

6) It helps avoid errors on most computer systems, and, is likely sufficient for all possible transactions everywhere.

2. Decentralized and crowd funded. Gold is top down and over regulated by a slow moving establishment. USD is heavily influenced by the Federal Reserve, which is a private company controlled by a very small and hidden group. Bitcoin gives the global population the ability to build the global reserve of the future.
3. The separation of currency and state. There's no natural law that says the government should control and manipulate reserve currencies. A free market reserve with the properties of Bitcoin leads to a financial source of truth that can be used as the foundation for measuring value.

g2anebc,Izrud,32,"A few words of wisdom to my fellow omisebros and omisegals.

&amp;nbsp;

Only you can decide what's best for you. Maybe that's taking some profits, maybe it's holding longer. There is no wrong answer here, because no one can predict the future. 

&amp;nbsp;

If you have waited this long (3+ years for some of us), do you honestly think this is the end of the road for OMG? That it won't go higher than this? That when Coinbase and Binance and Bittrex and Kraken all transfer to OMG for their tether volume, more people wouldn't want a piece of those watcher rewards? That when Omise clients start onboarding that won't cause interest in asian markets? From what I can tell the good news is just starting to come out. Whether it takes 3 weeks or another 3 years, some of us would greatly benefit with sitting with our asses firmly on our hands and far away from the sell button. 

&amp;nbsp;

Conversly, boy I held so many alts from ATH's to 95% down. At every turn I would convince myself that a 500% run up was just around the corner. Whether it was ETF's, wasltreet money, chinese new years, halvings... God i always knew it was bullshit, but deep down I secretly wanted to be wrong. And it cost me to go in debt. And it cost me sleep. And cost me happiness. It cost a hell of a lot more than what I think any money is worth in terms of stress. I won't get that time back ever again. But I can always make a little more money later. So be kind to yourself. Take whatever out you need to cover any oustanding debts. If you have credit cards pay them off. Anything higher interest than %3 should be a major goal in life to get rid off. 

&amp;nbsp;

Thirdly maybe you want to stay in the game, but diversify a little bit. Boy wouldn't it be nice to have 1 whole Bitcoin, 32 ETH AND some left over OMG's? It's not like BTC won't have another run. We all know it's just a matter of time, and being diversified sure helps you sleep better at night. Maybe it won't cause you to have another evening of seeing your profits triple, quadruple, etc in one evening. But on a long enough scale of time - it is sure to pay off eventually while getting some considerable stress off your shoulders. 

&amp;nbsp;

Again - **YOU CANNOT PREDICT THE FUTURE**. Make whatever is the best choice for you now. Today. And while it's ok to look at the past and learn from your mistakes - don't dwell on them. 

&amp;nbsp;

Getting it to work was fun. Getting it into ABC was not, so I didn't do that. BCHN is a lot more fun to work with, though, so I'm willing to get it into BCHN for fun.

I did aserti3-2d 50% for fun, and 50% because the problem was serious and needed to be fixed urgently. That's done.

The remote_stress test framework I built is working. It's a derivative of [this p2p_stresstest.py benchmark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5UvgfWVnYg), which I finished quite a while ago. I got no interest from deadalnix on it, but the BCHN devs are enthusiastic about including it in BCHN, so I'm [adding p2p_stresstest.py to BCHN](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/merge_requests/442) with their support. Polishing up the remote_stress framework and writing some articles using it to benchmark different scenarios will be next.

&gt;In our next report, we will be touching base on decentralized finance (DeFi), digital fungibility, and economic hedges. Based on our previous feedback survey, there has been a sudden interest in DeFi, and understanding valid gold comparisons. We will analyze the decentralized finance market to provide you with a better understanding between trend valuations and accurate valuations. Lastly, we will discuss the characteristic similarities for fungibility and privacy. Considering many crypto-assets claims to be private, only a privacy-by-default cryptocurrency such as Monero can be digitally fungible. We will break down various fundamentals between Bitcoin and Monero when using crypto-assets as an economic hedge.

g2jh7h8,JustAWildTurtle,29,"Another favourite (see /u/peterquest and /u/MoreCowbellMofo using it in this very thread) of theirs is the:

""Yeah but actually the global banking industry uses a ton of energy besides raw server costs for the transaction mainframes, Bitcoin is more efficient if you include those"".

So let us be nice and actually humour the point:

So first, let us grab some numbers.

* [Digiconomist tells us Bitcoin consumes roughly 66.5TWh per year](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/)

* [Visa, per it's corporate responsibility report has used 711,268
GJ of energy in 2018, or a ~0.1976 TWh per year rate](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/download/corporate-responsibility/visa-2018-corporate-responsibility-report.pdf)

* [Blockchain.com tells us the exact amount of transactions in the last 24h: _311,179_ at time of writing](https://www.blockchain.com/charts)

* [Visa claims a transaction capacity of _65,000 per second_ or ~5,616,000,000 per day](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/download/corporate/media/visanet-technology/aboutvisafactsheet.pdf)

If we take this last claim at face value, we get the following math: (God bless Wolfram alpha and it's ability to cope with arbitrary units)

||Transactions / day|Energy use|Energy per transaction (Transaction throughput / Energy use)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|VISA|5,616,000,000|0.1976 TWh|347.03 Joule / Transaction|
|Bitcoin|311,179|66.5TWh|2,108,000,000 Joule / Transaction|

(And for those comparing with the comments above, Bitcoin is at ~585kWh per transaction, so the 906kWh figure is a little high.)

Okay so a ""65,000 per second"" figure is both ludicrously optimistic and ignores that Visa's energy use will soar if it actually has to deal with that many transactions.

Let's knock that down to the more commonly cited figure of ""1500/second"" or 129,600,000/day and re-run the numbers.

||Transactions / day|Energy use|Energy per transaction (Transaction throughput / Energy use)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|VISA|129,600,000|0.1976 TWh|15,038 Joule / Transaction|
|Bitcoin|311,179|66.5TWh|2,108,000,000 Joule / Transaction|

Mhm. Still not making a dent.

But hey, Visa doesn't just handle transactions itself, it interfaces with the broader financial system that uses a ton more energy, so let's instead compare those numbers:

* Unfortunately, ""The entire financial industry"" doesn't publish their energy consumption numbers, so instead let's linearly (as we're comparing per-transaction) scale Bitcoin to their transaction throughput, and see how much energy the financial industry were to use if it were as efficient as Bitcoin is.

* [Capgemini puts the amount of global non-cash transactions at 538.6 billion in 2017](https://www.capgemini.com/es-es/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2019/09/World-Payments-Report-WPR-2019.pdf)

So, 585kWh times 538 billion is uh... _314,730 TWh_ used by the ""global financial industry at Bitcoin-efficiency level""

... This doesn't really say much on it's own. How much energy are we even talking about. I'm sure our friends at [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/energy) will be able to provide some context...

Let's see, global energy consumption in 2019 was ~159,000TWh, or roughly half our theoretical financial industry estimate.

Last I checked there's no Visa branded dyson sphere around the sun, so we can reasonably surmise that the financial industry is at least _twice_ as energy efficient per transaction as Bitcoin.

---

... Still here? Have a bonus:

So, thing about Bitcoin and likewise cryptocurrencies is that their transaction fees are a free market, and the transaction capacity is quite scarce by nature of that capacity having a hard ceiling.

The economic result of this is that the equilibrium towards which transaction fees increase is the utility value of the transaction; The user pays exactly what utility value they gained from sending the transaction, thus gaining net-zero value.

Which would normally be fine; Such markets are still a positive-sum-game for humanity as those providing the service reap profits. However, with cryptocurrency mining there is another aspect: There is a horrible tragedy of the commons at play.

Miners are allocated money from transaction fees based on the amount of hashrate (=computer work) they contribute. This functions as a 1:1 share; If you contribute 5% of the total hashrate of Bitcoin, you get 5% of the transaction fees.

Any individual miner can thusly only increase their profits by increasing the hashrate they have, and well, they readily do this. ([Blockchain.com has a chart where you can see this happen](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate))

And this is by design; As the collective hashrate increases, the network becomes harder to attack.

_But_, increasing hashrate does not increase the total transaction throughput (and thus collective transaction fees), the pool from which miners get paid remains the same. This means that the profit margins shrink, as the cost of mining does increase with increased hashrate.

And where does this rat-race of increasing hashrate hit equilibrium? _A profit margin of barely above 0%_; All transaction fees flow straight to the energy production companies.

Who, by the way, are also incentivized to lower their costs to barely above 0% profit; Miners will move to the cheapest electricity and are a huge consumer.

Thus the end result, at equilibrium, Bitcoin costs it's users exactly what value it provides; Being of net-zero benefit to them. Yet it also is of negligible profit to it's miners, who spend almost all of their earnings on electricity bills. And not even the energy companies see profits, as they compete each-other's profits away.

Because there's gonna be a few people asking: Conventional financial systems avoid this ""net-neutral-value equilibrium"" problem by simply _increasing capacity_. A bank transaction costs you far less than it's utility to you; Should the bank ever significantly increase their prices, you'd just go to another bank that'll do it for cheaper.

g2ir28r,EternityForest,24,"Bitcoin cannot reverse fraudulent transactions or recover lost keys.

g2is0ex,csb06,23,"I think blockchain can be viewed as a failed tech solution to a problem that is more social than technological. Bitcoin, for example, is a system that tries to decentralize the process of transferring funds in order to grant anonymity and remove power from the centralized banking/credit card/payment processing companies.

However, this only led to a new establishment of ""middlemen"" or centralized third parties that handle the transactions. Most people that use Bitcoin use some kind of third party software or service to interact with it, and as the article says, a handful of companies dominate the process of mining. The social problem - the mistrust in private institutions that act as middlemen to financial transactions - did not go away. Instead, there are now new middlemen who handle most transactions. There may be more visible checks for consistency than in the banking system, but it still hinges on placing trust in the third party intermediaries you use to do your transactions. And now there is the additional problem of tremendous energy inefficiency.

The ideal solution would be to leave the tech as it is (centralized databases that manage accounts and check for consistency) but instead reform the *social structures* that control this valuable data. The financial system could be publicly owned and operated, with open-source code and democratic oversight instead of leaving it in the hands of private companies with opaque security practices/data sharing policies/codebases. Guarantees for safety could be encoded into law and be verified to be met, since the tech would be available for anyone to inspect.

I get that these kinds of social reforms don't exist now, so they aren't an immediate alternative to blockchain-based systems. But I think that programmers/engineers too often think that technology alone can replace old social structures, when in fact new technology without corresponding social change only replicates the current social structures.",2020-08-23 06:32:36

This is of course only one concern, the amount of data that's collected can be used by almost any company to inform their decisions.

Your insurance provider can evaluate your risk based on who you associate with, the sort of information they're not allowed to ask when you apply, but information they can acquire anyways. Search China's social credit score program for an extreme example.

Personally I think the only real protection other than legislation (which holds dubious effect over intelligence agencies and law enforcement) is consumer encryption. If only you hold the key, they need a warrant to see your shit. And more and more apps (e.g. whatsapp) use protocols that prevent the server from ever being able to decrypt your messages. Only the sender or the recipient can do that, which again requires the authorities to get a warrant to read them, assuming they don't have a backdoor in your phone, however police departments almost certainly do not. Intelligence agencies probably don't, especially in Android because it's open source, but it's possible. As for protection of stuff other than records, well you're probably still going need to use the web, and almost every website has google or facebook (or both) tracking you, so you're kinda stuffed.

g2i3ojs,Qwahzi,11,"A couple of points in rebuttal:

- Nano's Nakamoto Coefficient (the number of entities required to collude to attempt a 51% attack) is the same as Bitcoin's:  https://twitter.com/patrickluberus/status/1292532679716601858

- Nano representatives are different from Bitcoin mining pools because they do NOT have control over the blockchain. They cannot reverse, modify, or double spend transactions, even with &gt;50% vote weight. This is partially because of Nano's block-lattice ledger data structure, where every account has its own blockchain that *only the owner can modify*

- Nano nodes *locally* make their own protocol decisions, and cement blocks (mark as irreversible) after they have achieved confirmation. Even if there was a 51% attack after the fact, your node would not reverse the transaction because that breaks the protocol rules (confirmed transactions can't be reversed). Compare this to Bitcoin, where enough hashrate can always reverse Bitcoin transactions. Hell, there was a [1-conf double spend](https://twitter.com/BitMEXResearch/status/1221681807881424898) in January. That's why exchanges make you wait 6-confs minimum, but even that could be theoretically reversed because Bitcoin uses probabilistic finality

- Nano's consensus mechanism allows users to remotely re-delegate their vote weight to anyone at any time, and gives the *users* of the protocol the control. Compare that to Bitcoin where miner and user desires can be at odds (e.g. maximum profit vs minimum fees), and it requires a lot more effort to relocate a physical Bitcoin mining farm

- To even attempt a 51% attack on Nano, you'd have to buy a huge amount of supply, probably pushing Nano's price to beyond Bitcoin's.

g2i18eb,mortuusmare,11,"Just so you are aware the article you linked is from July 2019 and was heavily debunked.

With ORV (Open Representative Voting) similar to DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) it is the users who decide who to allocate their voting weight to. Some people won't like to admit it, but Nano as well as cryptocurrency as a whole is in its infancy. There are currently 88 principle representatives on the Nano network who have enough voting power to broadcast votes ([source](https://nanocrawler.cc/network)). You are absolutely right in that the large amount of that voting weight is allocated to a few big reps, 3 reps have about 33% of the voting weight according to [MyNanoNinja](https://mynano.ninja/principals), Nanovault, Nanowallet and Binance. This is because two of these are early wallets that created reps and many still have their voting weight allocated to them. The last is Binance. Binance has their own principle representative so they have assigned all the Nano that they are in custody of to their own rep.

**This is an issue**. However, is it one that should become less of a problem over time. These reps had more voting weight last year, then Kraken listed Nano and created their own Principle rep, this reduced the voting weight that the top 3 had and now Kraken has 4% weight. As more exchanges list Nano and set up their own principle representatives the more the voting weight should even out. If Coinbase list Nano, they'll almost certainly set up their own principle rep which will see another drastic reallocation of voting-weight, spreading it out further.
 
But its not just exchanges. If a company really likes the idea of accepting Nano for their product/services because they could save ~3% in card or PayPal fees they would feel incentivized to help secure the network by setting up their own Principle Reps. Then you have the hobbyists who don't mind paying ~$50 a month to help secure the network. There doesn't need to be a financial incentive regardless of what the POW maximalists or stakers say. 

&gt; Gold doesn't rely on people to do the right thing. Bitcoin doesn't rely on people to do the right thing

Wikipedia doesn't pay their contributors. The contributors write, research and fact-check articles *because they want to*.  Modders for videogames release their mods to the community free of charge *because they want to*. People seed torrents *because they want to*. Crypto enthusiasts may want to set up principle representatives with no financial incentive to help secure the network *because they want to*.

Also, it's in the best interest of cryptocurrency exchanges and retail companies who have principle representatives to **secure** the network. It would make no sense to collude with other companies to get 51% voting-weight, manipulate the network for a few hours before people starting changing the reps. It would ruin their reputation and their business would consequently suffer. The financial gains from doing so would be peanuts compared to if they hadn't done so.",2020-08-23 03:28:49
g2ibyvw,Qwahzi,11,"- It's not apples to oranges, because 1) a 51% attack on Nano also requires a huge amount of capital, which is at risk of being made worthless when the attack fails, 2) Nano representatives also represent hundreds or thousands of individual Nano users, 3) even with &gt;50% of vote weight they can't reverse transactions (the big risk with a 51% attack in Bitcoin), 4) they could not effortlessly control the network forever because honest participants can lower their threshold and the only chains that would be stalled would be the attacker chains that attempt double spends

- A 51% attack with Bitcoin mining pools can also censor transactions or addresses

- 1-conf [is risky](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Irreversible_Transactions#How_many_confirmations_are_required). [Kraken](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/203325283-Cryptocurrency-deposit-processing-times) requires 6 confs, [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/support/articles/360030775291) requires 2, [Coinbase](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/sending-or-receiving-cryptocurrency/why-is-my-transaction-pending) requires 3

- Coin distribution gets better over time with more adoption and more exchanges, but at least Nano users even have some control. In Bitcoin, most people are dependent on whatever the majority mining hashrate decides

- Binance + Kraken + Kucoin + Bitgrail is still not enough to achieve &gt;50% vote weight on Nano. Also, the majority of Bitcoin hashrate is located in an authoritarian country, and it's much harder to relocate mining hashrate than it is to remotely redelegate vote weight",2020-08-23 04:30:09

As more and more bitcoins were mined, the availability of mining new bitcoins decreased, which meant miners had to start building specialized rigs based on GPUs, otherwise they would be spending more money on the electricity to mine a bitcoin than the actual value of the bitcoin itself.

Since GPUs are expensive, the cost of mining bitcoins became even more prohibitive since it took many more GPUs and much more electricity to mine a bitcoin than it used to.

g2lrnc0,Bakounin,5,"After reading all the comments to your question, it seems to me that a lot of people have problem remembering what do we need to use Visa/Mastercard cards for. 

""We need them to buy goods and services online !!!""

I bought my first Bitcoins for one and only one reason, to buy things that I wanted on Silk Road. I beleive most of the people in 2011-2013 that bought Bitcoins, did it for the same exactly reason. I didnt care about the wonders of the DLT technology that Bitcoin brought to this world, neither did most of the other people. People cared enough to get some magical Internet money as that was the only way for them to get the they wanted. Simply put it was the usecase that attracted them.


I jumped on the Crypto crazyness wagon after the Cyprus-related Bitcoin pump, the greed drove me there and that is what still keeps me here. I firmly believe that this is the case for a lot of people in the cryptosphere. Some even wrap their greed in a cognitive dissonance of a true best DLT seeker. All rubish, we all want to get rich or/and remain rich. Since 2013 I have heard myriads of claims about the usefulness of the Bitcoin and other crypto projects, and jumped/switched/diversified to many different DLTs promising to take over the world with their fastest or the most secure or the most scalable tech. All very interesting and promising but GREED was my main driver and still is.

I will reply to the OP from the position not of a crypto investor but from the position of normal people that I have tried to convince to join the ""Crypto Revolution"" during the last 7 years. Literally nothing other than ""you might get super rich"" was attractive to most of them. The digitalization (at least in the Western countries) has made everything extreamly easy and thus most of modern and quite impressive DLT solutions remain unattractive to the general public. It is again mostly the GREED that fuels the new-commers to the cryptoshere and I presume that is why Bitcoin's selling point have switched from becoming the world currency to becoming a SoV, a hedge against the fiat inflation. 

So what do normies need to enter the cryptosphere other than greed?

They need a REASON to use them. DLT solutions need to offer them an easy, and if possible, the only way and of doing something that they NEED or WANT. In the same spirit to what attracted me personally to Bitcoin. Crypto projects need to offer products or services that people need and hesitate or cant use their Visa. Not technical advantages but a real usecase to address peoples needs. A lot of DLT solutions offer many increadible advantages against Visa payments but those still remain relatively unattractive to the normies. Say for example the privacy coins, they offer a huge advantage for the DNM but look at the statistics:

https://medium.com/@eliezer.ndinga/the-state-of-privacy-coins-b873982acbe4

The vast majority of users use BTC and continue doing so despite the myriads of arrests. Looking at the study one might speculate that a simple reason for that could be, that most of DNMs accept only BTC, with only a few of them accepting XMR and nothing else. So maybe if the DNMs accepted more privacy coins people would use them more often. 

Now extrapolating that to the normies, if the clear web ecommerce platforms would start accepting privacy coins, that would potentially be a great reason to attract normies. As Visa or other regular digital payments do not offer privacy. A real usecase, something that adds a tangible value to digital coins. 

The same study contains something that may support my hypothesis and possibly even a local EMH. The study questions the users and most of them despite using BTC are aware of privacy coins and actually own some. One surpising result, according to the authors, is that the 3rd most held privacy coin was Particl, even though its not accepted on any of DNMs. 

So a looot of privacy coins out there, so what is up ? Why this one ? After checking the Particl Project I discovered that they have developed a privacy-focused decentralized marketplace. Digging a bit more into the tech and what it provides, it seems it is way ahead not only of all the current DNMs but also of the promises from the new tech coming from the Russian Hydra market. I guess the DNM users somehow were aware of that. 

Now the true potential of such technology is not its privacy features or anything related to DLT. The true potential is that it allows the normies to buy easily, freely and privately products and services. So what if in my quest to convince people to join cryptos, I could ignore mentioning the word crypto and simply point out to them an interesting market on the Particl's marketplace. What would happen then? Well I think the same people after looking at a potentially attractive product would return back to me with a simple question, how do I buy things there! 

So I think usecases like that is what the cryptosphere needs to attract normies. A rule of thumb evaluating a DLT solution for attracting normies could be:
""Point out a DLT solution existance to normies, without any convincing that they need it. If they get what they need or comeback asking for help to get it, then the DLT its has a tangible value""",2020-08-24 02:29:22

g2rffc6,rockspapersscissors,21,"All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity‚Äôs smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is ‚Äúeasy,‚Äù think about the all the times you‚Äôve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That‚Äôs right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we‚Äôre using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I‚Äôve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I‚Äôm perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don‚Äôt want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I‚Äôve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you‚Äôll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the ‚Äúfacts‚Äù that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don‚Äôt need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you‚Äôve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it‚Äôs difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That‚Äôs not to say I don‚Äôt understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan‚Äôs chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters‚Äô lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I‚Äôm talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have ‚Äúdelusions of grandeur‚Äù are due to my being ‚Äúhigh‚Äù or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day.

I think trying to make any predictions is a fool's errand but that is what we are here to do so I guess I'll just put my thoughts down.

I think the market overall is more bullish than bearish, i.e. people are more likely to buy and hold then to sell so I view this as consolidation, and I don't think it'll take as long to move up as 9k. Especially with sentiment this low (futures premium is the lowest it's been in weeks, possibly months) and we're still maintaining &gt;11k, I think we'll have at most another month of sideways in this range. If we can maintain a &gt;11k price for another month I'll hesitantly up my leverage to maybe 10x. 

**Pure baseless speculation just for fun** \- Fractals are just as predictive as any other TA (that is to say not very predictive), but many are using comparisons to 2016 to predict future price action. While it is entirely possible that we may hit ATH and then plummet down 30% like in 2016, I'm going to take the contrarian position and say that probably won't happen. I think many, like I was, are expecting something like that to happen. It's possible, maybe even likely now, that we just move through ATH slowly and steadily with low volatility. 

I'm also going to increase my expected bubble top to 300-350k. I wrote previously that I think the top would be around 200-300k, but with inflation possibly going through the roof I wanted to adjust my expected top. I may still start scaling out at 200k but it entirely depends on the velocity we get there. In 2017 the price doubled in a month. This next bubble could be the same in that we could spend months trying to clear 50k, 100k, 150k, and then only weeks to clear 200k, 250k, and 300k. When we start getting weekly returns of 30-40% we'll know we're reaching the top.

As I said before, though, the absolute top will be w/e gold's market cap is. I think right now if Bitcoin has gold's market cap it would be around 400k a coin. This will be the driver of the next bubble. Everyone is going to want to get in because of headlines like ""Bitcoin *is definitely going to be* the new gold so buy now and get 100's of % returns!,"" etc., but after that hype is gone we pop.",2020-08-26 10:33:56

g2u2psm,MobTwo,9,"I can't wait for November to be over so that we can move on without a dictator enforcing his own terms on the chain. Looking at the positive interactions between the multiple node implementations (with the exception of Bitcoin ABC) has given me lots of hope, optimism, and sense of happiness over the long term future of Bitcoin Cash. I know some people may feel worried and cautious and that's normal because over the last 4 years, Bitcoin ABC had created such a toxic environment. Even recently, their supporters are spreading FUD to increase fear and uncertainties in the community. Even Vermorel, the guy who is always missing from Bitcoin Cash only to appear once a blue moon to sing praises for Amaury while attacking other BCH developers is active again, writing a smear hit piece using false accusations to harm the reputation of other BCH developers.

Like I said, I can't wait for November to be over so that everyone else can start making real progress which Bitcoin ABC had been obstructing over the last 4 years.

&gt; There have been tons of attempts at scaling that have been done, just none that have made it into Bitcoin ABC. That's because Amaury has generally stonewalled all attempts at scaling. He rejected my proposal to fix the recursivemutex issue with the source code (I recommended a switch to readers/writers (shared) mutexes), which makes the code difficult to parallelize. He sabotaged my attempts to develop Xthinner. He sabotaged Shammah's attempts to fix the O(n2) transaction chain issue. He opposed mainnet stress testing, and has not supported testnet stress testing, and ignored my own testnet/regtest stress tests. He has put no resources into scaling at all.

&gt; Bitcoin Unlimited has done a ton of scaling work, as has Flowee. I think Flowee was tested with 10k tx/sec a while ago. BU added Graphene v2 and parallelized almost everything. But BCH is only as fast as the slowest node.

&gt; The reason why there seems to be an ""anti-ABC mob"" is because a lot of us who have been paying close attention have noticed a pattern of subtle but heavy manipulation, sabotage, and power games from Amaury (and consequently, from ABC as a whole). But because he's usually pretty good at keeping his manipulation subtle, it only gets noticed by the devs and the people that he's attacking or manipulating. This makes them seem like they're crazy, and so they usually get sidelined. Amaury comes out of each conflict as the hero and the victor, and his credibility goes up whereas his enemies go down.

Here's what happened: The developers on Core *compromised*, took money and ever since had a conflict of interest. LN and Liquid has been their goal for a long time. They don't want people scaling unless it's with their products and unless it benefits them.

There really are only two likely scenarios:

- Trump wins; short-term the stock market gravy train keeps going, and we ride along with the US Stock Market as they overexert the system and run it into the ground. Trump already tweeted negatively about Bitcoin and crypto once. He's surrounded by a surprising amount of ""pro-crypto"" people, so they might be able to steer him towards the light. Long-term: the US Economy goes bankrupt and melts down.

- Biden wins; Trump contests results and will use any legal, and also illegal, means to generate as much pandemonium as possible. You'll for sure see accusations of voter fraud, planted evidence, undercover cameras, all of it. The US dollar crashes against the Euro, turmoil for a couple of months, eventually the adults take over and the healing begins. If crypto can hold its ground against the USD we could see moon prices sooner rather than later (albeit they'll mostly be as a result of the devalued).

This is a massive policy change and will buoy the markets.

Do not short the S&amp;P or Bitcoin. This will go further than you think. My targets are 4200-4500 on S&amp;P and $20,000-$22000 on Bitcoin by early November (before the election).

&gt;Fast forward to late 2019.  I attended a Bitcoin Cash celebration in Vancouver and sat next to Amaury on the connecting flight.  It was at that time when he explained to me how the total SHA-256 pool would be forced to subsidize BCH.  I thought it was a clever idea, and important to help ABC get the infrastructure funding they needed. In 2020, I took it upon myself to try to help ABC in this way.  I contacted BTC.top, ViaBTC, and Antpool and presented our idea.


Is this the first time you disclose this? I've never heard it before and was sure that the miners came up with the IFP.

&gt;ABC‚Äôs version of the IFP (if you can even call it that) is so poor that the issues are surfacing even before it is released.  Take myself for example -- in the span of half a year, I went from being someone who Amaury wanted on his 2 of 3 multisig to a political enemy.  The project I maintain (Electron Cash) went from being ‚Äúessential infrastructure‚Äù that was included in the first IFP to a project now demonized by an ABC supporter. The only discernible reason for this change of position is that I am now an IFP opponent rather than a suporter.  This is what happens when politics are invited into the protocol.

[PnF Chart Here](https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/pnf.php?c=%24BTCUSD,PWTADANRNO[PA][D][F1!3!!!2!20])

Yesterday the drop put us into a low pole warning situation.  This occurs when the price drops 4 boxes below the breakdown point.  It reflects that the price is dropping beyond what is ‚Äúexpected‚Äù.  In an EILIF wording, it overshot the bottom.

When this happens the reversal and bounce are often fast and significant.  It is the rule of thumb that the price, when it reverses, will move up 50% of the column where it settles down.

As of right now (10:49 AM, EDT the price $11,466) the price climbed up that low pole 7 boxes on a 13 box column.  So that is a ‚Äútext book‚Äù rebound.

I know there are people reading this saying, ‚ÄúOK, you are great at predicting what has already happened.‚Äù  I plead guilty to that.  

But this is my explanation:

I post these to reflect how to read the charts.  When you recognize what is happening in the chart it is possible to make some pretty good predictions as to where its going.  For example, we saw a break down yesterday.  Looking at the chart I predicted a low of 11,150.  When it got in that area it created the low pole.  If you were shorting, that is where you should have started closing down your trade.  If you were waiting for a reversal (up 3 boxes from the low point) you could have played the Low Pole Reversal and picked up $200-250 on the price.

PNF Charting gives you ranges and potential movements.  Unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt tell you ‚Äúwhen‚Äù.  But a brief 3-5 minute review the chart every morning will give you the ‚Äútargets‚Äù you should have in your head when looking at the price.

So, right now we are in a column of Xs.  If the price drops below 11,000 today that column is moot and we go bak to the long pole (the chart ‚Äúsets‚Äù at the daily close‚Äîwhich is 00:00 UTC.). The formation is 4 columns wide.  Any move up should be marginal.    

Shooting up from a low pole is usually a couple day event‚Äîif it is going to break out, the price must rise above 11,800.  The peak of that break would be about four boxes, or 12,000‚Ä¶.again.

The trend is still upwards and a reversal is currently in the 8,000 range.  I am very confident we won‚Äôt see a $3k crash today.  (From my fingers to God‚Äôs ears!)

Here is the PnF overview for those of you new to the process:

[PnF Charting Explanation and Primer](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/03/081303.asp)

This charting method can be taught to 5th graders.  I read the book on the process and there was a chapter of how it works, and how it was taught to a class of 5th graders.  Over the period they discussed, the 5th graders beat the index percentages by a lot.  

It is simple.  It removes noise.  And it gives easy to understand parameters and good, basic targeting abilities.

A personal aside--no more bitcoin stuff here:

For those who have asked, I wanted to thank you for checking in about my family.  Today marks 1 year since my wife‚Äôs surgery and diagnosis with pancreatic cancer.  It was also the day my Mom passed.  It has been a year of lows, lowers, and lowest.  But, I am happy to say that my wife is cancer free, back and work, and appreciative of the good feelings sent her way.

Thanks for asking.  I know we don‚Äôt ‚Äúknow‚Äù you guys.  But it is nice to have people asking and passing along good thoughts.  

If you have never been in my position, let me tell you‚Äîevery word of encouragement means a lot.  If you do not reach to folks you know in these situations because you don‚Äôt know what to say, just say ‚ÄúI am thinking of you, I hope you are OK.‚Äù  

Its funny, I was kind of surprised at the number of ""friends"" who disappeared over the past year.   They heard the news; said they were sorry; and then they were ghosts.  Mostly because they did not know what to say.  I am telling you, it doesn't matter what you say.  Just BE there to listen and be ""normal.""

Thus, public is really what you want at the base layer of the protocol of a secure global currency. More of a feature than a bug.

And if you want privacy, move over to a bitcoin layer 2 solution.

Taking off my bitcoin maximalist hat, I don‚Äôt have a strong enough understanding of the privacy potential of bitcoin layer 2 solutions to further expand on the above argument.

g2xsjjv,decibels42,9,"I see a large focus in your post on ‚Äúon chain governance.‚Äù Take a look at my post below before replying, but how do you reconcile my issue with on chain governance at the base layer?

In my view, the base layer of a chain should be as absolutely simple as possible and hardened over time. Then, on top of that base layer, all kinds of systems can be built out (voting included).

Imo, for Polkadot, in the best case, I see it as too unpredictable for high value use cases to depend on it (I can‚Äôt trust a base layer/central chain that can change its rules and create inconsistency under me). At worst, the voting power either remains majority dominated/centralized by the founders (there‚Äôs been 3 rounds of VC investing, aside from the Web3/Parity holdings), or it becomes ‚Äúbought‚Äù by future investors who will control the narrative and dominate the direction of the chain (ala Blockstream and Bitcoin).

Also, Vitalik has written extensively with the issues of on chain governance (he‚Äôs in favor of other solutions, potentially quadratic voting).

g2z6hn6,Capt_Roger_Murdock,8,"I guess it‚Äôs ‚Äúsurvived‚Äù in the narrow sense, but I‚Äôm having a hard time feeling too optimistic right now.  Three years after BCH forked off for the purposes of lifting the 1-MB block size limit, the median block size of this ""big block"" chain is about... 100 kb. (The then-undivided Bitcoin chain began consistently exceeding that level back in late 2012.) And BCH is trading at a USD price the then-undivided Bitcoin chain first achieved back in 2013. And the price ratio to BTC is currently under 2.5%, an all-time low.

To quote Peter Rizun‚Äôs paraphrase of an analogy I shared with him:

&gt;I've also been feeling down about bitcoin since the hash war. Like /u/capt_roger_murdock said to me recently, between 2015 - 2017 bitcoin was a tree growing in a container too small for it to thrive. For over two years, we tried to move it to a larger pot without success. So we ended up taking a small cutting from the bitcoin tree and planting it in a much bigger pot. The little cutting admittedly looked kind of stupid in such a big pot, but with some watering and fertilizer we told ourselves that it would grow to fill that large container and more. But then just when the cutting was starting to establish some roots and to bud with new leaves, we decided to cut it in half, move each half to even bigger pots, and then trample and pee on both.

Being forced to fork off BTC as a rebranded minority chain did serious damage to BCH‚Äôs network effect, but with time I think it could have recovered. But then the messy BSV split did even more damage. And then ABC‚Äôs disastrous leadership and IFP fuckery did even more. I‚Äôm still *hopeful* that the bitcoin peer-to-peer electronic cash project that filled me with so much excitement back in 2012 will find a way to succeed. But ‚Äúoptimistic‚Äù?

g2ypwrs,puff_paff,8,"&gt; don‚Äôt you see?

all I see is people with questionable analytic skills spreading meme-analysis as truths. 

- a couple weeks ago the correlation boyz were hot and sweaty about SPX correlation; probably they all left and bought a boat with their profits exploiting this brilliant trading edge; they deserve it, finding two arbitrary charts and some pattern during some random timeframe is some real alpha.

- DXY is an index relative to other currencies (euro, yen, gbp). Dollar down, implies people fleeing to BTC as save investment, I have been told.... but wait? dxy down means euro up, so this means euro people are selling bitcoin for euros as a more save investment, right? uhm.... reductio ad absurdum, unless everything what is happening on international forex market can be explained by bitcoin switching hands across continents? This must be the only logical explanation since I started with crypto some years ago and really like it, ergo: everything happening in the world must also be about crypto.

- since most of us saw the inflation [shopping card](https://chrislo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Bitcoin-shopping-cart-inflation-deflation-protecting-federal-reserve.jpg) picture over at /r/bitcoin, we can call ourselves experts in macro-economics; inflation is not some very complicated long-term process, but is happening right now (this moment even when I am browsing reddit late at night); the charts are not bored people speculating but are a direct reflection of real world causes such as inflation: it's so really easy: we can see immediately how the dollar getting weaker means bitcoin is succeeding.

- lastly, clearly some wall street guys are taking advantage of this, any good story needs a bad guy; quants with PhDs are reading this subreddit (which is like 10-15 of the same people posting daily) to gauge market sentiment and will take advantage of this indubitable market correlation; they stopped trading other markets with thousand times more liquidity and opened bitmex accounts (and are shilling their reflinks to Nancy at the reception right now).

Your article lists exchanges as part of ""the community"", but I don't think that's the case generally. There certainly have been a few who also run miners and have commented by making statements about what they will mine, but there are also many that have not commented at all, including major ones like Coinbase, and others that have taken (dubiously) ""neutral"" positions. Many, despite listing BCH, may not consider themselves part of BCH's ""community"", and may not be interested in its politics.

I think those exchanges aren't looking for these kinds of arguments. It's a little too ""Here is why ABC's plan is bad"" and not enough ""The BCH community rejects ABC and its plan, and here is why you should listen to the community"". 

Many coins just simply have centralized development -- lead devs that implement whatever ideas they like, whether they make for ""sound money"" or not. Exchanges deal with these kinds of coins all the time. I don't think the exchanges particularly care whether these changes are bad for a coin. They just let the devs do what they want with ""their"" coin and leave it to the market to decide which coins are valuable. 

I think what we need is a short article that makes a compelling case to these exchanges for **why Bitcoin Cash should not be treated that way -- why it is important that Bitcoin Cash is not defined by a single dev team (ABC) or a single website (bitcoincash.org).** I fully expect that if we can get *at least* ""fair"" ticker treatment, BCH can reject IFP successfully -- almost no one wants the IFP. My last remaining concern at this point is whether or not the disinterested exchanges will give the non-ABC chain that treatment, and that's why I believe we need to be focusing in this direction.

For instance (just one idea) -- we could argue that Bitcoin Cash came about in 2017 because the rules of BTC could not be changed to accommodate a significant hard fork block size increase, and the BCH community has always seen Bitcoin Core's resistance to such a change as a large reason for this. That's why, ever since the earliest days of BCH, BCH has prioritized having multiple implementations, **specifically** to avoid a recurrence of that situation where one dev team gets the final say on consensus matters, and that is why there are six or so BCH node implementations available and why the majority of miners have already switched to a different one. The BCH community may have gone along with ABC in the past based on the merits of the individual decisions, but it was never the case that the community saw ABC as some kind of definer of the coin who gets the final say on **all** decisions, and therefore, to treat BCH as being owned and led by ABC (or defined by bitcoincash.org, which ABC controls) despite massive opposition from the ecosystem would go against the central principles of the coin's community.

(Maybe there are other, better arguments.)

Also, we need to clearly and concisely back up any claim of massive opposition to ABC. We could probably do that with a signed statement by everyone against ABC's Coinbase Rule, and more generally, against BCH being defined by the decisions of a single entity like ABC or Bitcoincash.org. We have a statement by those in favor of ASERT over Grasberg, but that is technically outdated now. We also have lots of individual statements, but nothing really nicely presented that unites them, I think. 

I think we should have a new statement, or at least an easy-to-parse table of all the major figures in the BCH ecosystem and who stands on which side, [like this one that was made for Segwit](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Segwit_support), so that the exchanges can clearly see at a glance where the ecosystem support is. We shouldn't expect them to be keeping up with all of our drama.

Sorry if this comment is a bit of an oblique response to your article.",2020-08-27 07:36:55

They see in their reluctance to hard-fork to raise the block size a lesson that ""resistance to change is bad,"" and have concluded that the opposite is good.

I think that's wrong. If Core were resistant to change, they would not have made a highly radical change by refusing to raise the block size.

Scaling was always part of the ""instrinsic promise"" of Bitcoin, and IMO refusing to scale is as egregious a violation of that promise as changing the block reward.

The lesson is in fact that Core was far too willing to change the basic promise behind Bitcoin.

At one extreme, say it's SHA256. In that case, $100 will buy you a used Antminer S9 ASIC hashing rig, which can try 14 *trillion* hashes per second. It won't take an hour, it'll take 17 seconds. Obviously this isn't a ""standard computer,"" but it only cost $100.

However, you can only buy dirt-cheap used ASIC hashing rigs for hashes that are used in popular cryptocurrency mining. (I use the S9 as an example because it is no longer profitable to mine Bitcoin with one, so they are now worthless for that purpose and available at fire-sale prices.)

Say it's something else and you can't use ASICs. $5,000 will put together a system with 4 modern GPUs (say nVidia GTX 2070s.) Your speed then could be over 100 billion hashes/sec on MD5 or SHA-1, maybe 85 billion hashes/sec on SHA-256, or 60 billion hashes/sec on SHA-512.

You do need GPUs, though. CPUs are awful at this category of problems (known whimsically in computer science as ""[embarrassingly parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel) problems."") You might get 50-100 million hashes per second on a very high-end Intel or AMD CPU, like a thousandth of what comparably-priced GPU would generate.

However, keep in mind these are all standard hash algorithms, not purpose-designed password hashes like bcrypt or PBKDF2. Cracking those is *enormously* slower, many orders of magnitude. For instance, that same $5,000 GPU cracking rig might manage 60 thousand hashes per second on bcrypt. Not billion, *thousand*.",2020-08-28 14:20:21

g35zud3,parakite,6,"My opinion (tldr: bullish) regarding bitcoin price action in near future, written in answer to a question in /r/bitcoinbeginners:

&amp;#x200B;

I started buying btc in 2016, and have been holding only btc since then. I continue to hold it, and even buy it, even though today my so called btc stash is 20x its original price.

Here is my general opinion about btc's price action in next 2-3 years

* first point, there will be no parabola like late 2017, where btc price went 4x in about 4 months. 4x price action in such short range, will not happen, Because there are many exchanges like bakkt and cme, which allow shorting of btc. Which means that price action will not be drastic.
* the upward movement in price will continue for next 2-3 yeras, and beyond. Overall, I expect it to be at 18k at EOY, and at about 25k-40k at end of 2021.
* The price rise is happening due to demand from gbtc ( normal 401-k holders), and demand from recent buyer like Microstrategy , which is a mnc that bought staggering 22k btc. That 22k btc, btw, took price from 9k to 11k. So here you can see demand directly taking price higher. I keep a tight watch on gbtc, and its accumulating btc at a drastic pace, spurred by demand from normal fellows mostly who are buying it for their 401-k. On top of that, get this, gbtc has **no redemption program**. Which means it only buys btc, ( and sells it only for fees if any).
* And now Fidelity is coming with its own Bitcoin Fund ( and only Bitcoin). That shows the demand for Bitcoin from the investors at large.
* Governments have already realized they cannot stop btc. Trump had told Mnuchin in 2018 to ""go after btc'. But mnuchin could not do anything, because there is not much he can do. So on that front, bitcoin has proven ( to the extent) its strength as decentralized network which can't be brought down easily be governments. That's why microstrategy bought it too - they aren't fools to put so much money in something Mnuchin could bring down overnight by a decree. So there will be no such decree.
* Another bullish point is ABSOLUTE lack of any alternative to btc. The top 10, apart from btc, is a shitshow. XRP is an out and out scam. and even others are totally no shots and scams. So Bitcoin is the only thing in this market.
* I think anyone who buys btc today, and holds for next 10 years, can get returns of about 10x-15x. And the thing is, the risk is very low, so I strongly recommend people to buy at least 10-20% of their portfolio in btc. This is for EVERYONE. I myself am about 80% into btc.
* Finally, don't buy btc if you can't stand falls as much as 75% ( in few months), and **more**. This is speculative asset. The base price is defined by long term holders, but the daily market price is defined by traders, who will sell all btc they hold ( even as people like me will not do that). So the price can flucuate, and I recommend you only buy if you can hold it for minimum 4 years.",2020-08-29 04:26:32

* the upward movement in price will continue for next 2-3 yeras, and beyond. Overall, I expect it to be at 18k at EOY, and at about 25k-40k at end of 2021.
* The price rise is happening due to demand from gbtc ( normal 401-k holders), and demand from recent buyer like microstrategy , which is a mnc that bought staggering 22k btc. That 22k btc, btw, took price from 9k to 11k. So here you can see demand directly taking price higher. I keep a tight watch on gbtc, and its accumulating btc at a drastic pace, spurred by demand from normal fellows mostly who are buying it for their 401-k. On top of that, get this, gbtc has **no redemption program**. Which means it only buys btc, ( and sells it only for fees if any).
* And now Fidelity is coming with its own Bitcoin Fund ( and only Bitcoin). That shows the demand for Bitcoin from the investors at large.
* Governments have already realized they cannot stop btc. Trump had told Mnuchin in 2018 to ""go after btc'. But mnuchin could not do anything, because there is not much he can do. So on that front, bitcoin has proven ( to the extent) its strength as decentralized network which can't be brought down easily be governments. That's why microstrategy bought it too - they aren't fools to put so much money in something Mnuchin could bring down overnight by a decree. So there will be no such decree.
* Another bullish point is ABSOLUTE lack of any alternative to btc. The top 10, apart from btc, is a shitshow. XRP is an out and out scam. and even others are totally no shots and scams. So Bitcoin is the only thing in this market.
* I think anyone who buys btc today, and holds for next 10 years, can get returns of about 10x-15x. And the thing is, the risk is very low, so I strongly recommend people to buy at least 10-20% of their portfolio in btc. This is for EVERYONE. I myself am about 80% into btc.",2020-08-29 04:20:51

1) Perhaps that is not your question and you are curious where you can buy 5 USD of Bitcoin? If so , what country are you in?

2) Onchain transaction fees for sending Bitcoin mean that you want to try and send low priority fee transactions. Right now ~25 sat a byte txs are clearing thus you can pay to send a 10 cent a tx onchain and get a confirmation in a day , less than that and you might wait longer

The problem with good OPSEC is that it is inconvenient. It requires restricting access to listings, it requires Monero, it requires multi-sig. 

A flashy user interface, easy transactions, simple transaction completion all seem amazing in theory, and provide a better vendor and buyer experience (and we explain why here: www.darkwaterosint.wordpress.com), but they are inherently insecure. Any market accepting bitcoin, is open to LE involvement. 

We scraped 60+ buyers from Silk Road 1 market just by using their clearnet published Bitcoin addresses and ties to known and published Silk Road escrow accounts. We got names, and e-mail addresses tied to Facebook accounts for donations, or posts asking for contributions on the clearnet, etc. It took about 3 minutes. 

It sure would suck if LE has that same information and some poor individuals got arrested 13 years after the fact (disclaimer: its happened dozens of times, because the blockchain is eternal). 

When selecting a market your personal safety has to be your top priority. The flashy, new, untested markets, with Empire like bitcoin set ups are of course easier to use than White House. But they are also the kinds of markets that mean you'll be worrying about being vanned decades after the fact. 

We are in no way endorsing WHM or any other market, but rather pointing out that selecting a platform that you are using to commit a crime should be based on your personal safety only. Ease of use should not enter your head, because the less complex it is for you, the less complex it is for anyone who wants to find you also. 

Stay safe.

Excellent question, Bitcoin is one of the most important open source projects in existence and need to work in solidarity to improve it and society as a whole. Your design background might help with the documentation that could use more images and diagrams or helping test UX issues in wallets and services. 

If you aren't a developer than here are ways to contribute.


1) Educate yourself more-
https://lopp.net/bitcoin.html

2) Run an economic full node - https://btcinformation.org/en/wallets/desktop/windows/bitcoincore/

3) Possibly mine with an ASIC after doing 100 hours of research - 
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=14.0

4) Perform translations-

https://github.com/achow101/btcinformation.org

https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoincore.org


5) write documentation 

https://github.com/achow101/btcinformation.org

https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoincore.org

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page

http://lopp.net/bitcoin.html

https://github.com/jlopp/lopp.net/blob/master/bitcoin.html

6) Start a blog , or write articles on medium about bitcoin. 

7) Participate more on social media websites and forums educating others 

8) Attend local meetups and discuss Bitcoin IRL

9) Sell Bitcoin locally

10) manage a bitcoin atm 

11) Set various buy limit orders (In addition to buying Bitcoin at regular intervals)  on an exchange you use with deposited fiat. This will decrease Bitcoin's volatility by increasing buy limit support which is critical to both investor confidence and Bitcoin maturing into a stable currency and a less volatile unit of account. The side benefit is you can auto pickup any dips and save money.

12) Help answer new user questions on r/BitcoinBeginners

13) Invest in more Bitcoin , but focus on spending and replacing as well to support local businesses that accept Bitcoin. 

14) Help local Merchants accept Bitcoin

13) Help test open source bitcoin software by reporting any bugs you find to the developers. Most projects have a github page which has an issue tracker.

14) Donate to open source bitcoin projects and other bitcoin-related volunteer efforts.

15) Provide liquidity in joinmarket

16) Provide liquidity on Bisq

17) Buy Bitcoin and securely store it

18) Spend money (BTC) with merchants that accept Bitcoin and replace the spent BTC. Better yet , go to a bar or restaurant that accepts Bitcoin with friends and family and pay the bill with Bitcoin in front of them to show them how easy it is.",2020-08-30 07:04:56

Make sure they have reasonable fees. But watch out if their prices are TOO good. Scam exchanges will offer great prices to sell your bitcoin, and people will use them without researching because it looks like such a great deal.

And just because an exchange was legit 1 year ago doesn't mean they are ok to use today. So even if you used them previously, check up on them again before sending money.

Why would he buy Bitcoin for? If for actually *using* it, it would be pointless to buy Bitcoin BTC as it cannot be *used*, because it is too prohibitively expensive, cumbersome, slow and faulty for any Joe Sixpack.

The only thing that can be done with BTC is speculate and sell it on an exchange, which is not really *using*, nor what is and was the *point* of the invention of Bitcoin in the first place (it was supposed to be a currency, as in something you can *use* to *buy* goods and services).

But the problem with exchanges is, they do not hold your Bitcoin. Bitcoin held at an exchange is not Bitcoin, it is a promise of Bitcoin. Avoiding of which situation *was* *exactly* the reason for inventing Bitcoin in the first place.

So logically in this situation, what we do here is point newbies to a Bitcoin that they can **use** and actually *works*. Meaning: **Bitcoin Cash**, BCH.

g3eei64,Zeyode,3,"&gt;Can I start a small business?

You can, but only a co-op if you wanna avoid hypocrisy. The main point of anarchism is to abolish as much hierarchy as possible, which the traditional business (big or small) relies on. A power imbalance where owners have power over workers. Worker co-ops solve this power imbalance by bringing democracy to the workplace, and giving workers collective ownership of the places they work at, effectively ridding the business of any distinction between worker and owner. An economy mainly comprised of co-ops would be called market socialist, or market anarchist (depending on whether or not the hierarchy of the state is yeeted at this point). The way I see it, small businesses are better than big ones, but at the end of the day, it's the same thing on a smaller scale.

&gt;Should I be donating to the needy?

It's good praxis to help the needy however you can, but you don't have to. Everyone has their own living expenses, so it would be unreasonable to expect everyone to just donate all the time.

&gt;Can I work in finance?

If/when we abolish the commodity form, the job would be rendered redundant. However, I don't think that we'd be able to abolish the market economy in our lifetimes, so you'd be safe if you did. Even co-ops need people managing finances. It's not unheard of for people to go for econ degrees for this exact purpose.

&gt;Can I trade stocks for a living?

This however, wouldn't really make sense even in a market anarchist society. Co-ops and stocks don't mix. Stocks are a measurement of ownership of a company that can be consolidated, giving the people who own more stocks disproportionate power over the workers. Stock trading doesn't make sense if you also wanna abolish that hierarchy. Might be okay for making money in the short term. Just not long term.

&gt;What are your thoughts on Bitcoin?

I'm neutral on it. I want currency to eventually be abolished, but in the meantime, it's fine. At best, it's useful if you need to buy something under the table for whatever reason. At worst, it was annoying for a while when bitcoin miners bumped up the price of GPUs. Been thinking of getting some for a rainy day, but idk where to begin.

g3ems4p,dobeyactual,3,"Well, mining RandomX on a GPU is basically worthless to do. And I wouldn't say that being ASIC-resistant prevents centralization (nor does having ASICs necessarily result in it). One could just as easily set up a massive warehouse full of basic Ryzen systems to take over X% of mining operations.

Being ASIC resistant just means more that everyone can do it at a worthwhile pace, as long as no massive entity sets up said warehouse, or mines on a botnet on a few million cloud servers, phones, or IoT things. While with Bitcoin, you basically have to use an ASIC, and ones that can mine enough to get a halfway decent return are pretty expensive.",2020-08-31 07:20:19

However, if someone wants to buy Bitcoin because he heard you can buy things with it, well, they should know that they will be paying hefty fees and that BTC is really not meant for payments and that Bitcoin Cash is a better currency for that.

Nothing wrong with that.

g3fh24z,ketchuma,3,"There is a war in crypto between industry and essence and XMR is a critical pillar in determining which way the house will cave (if that makes sense). Essence mandates a stronger P2P Bitcoin/Monero economy in tandem with DEXs. Industry pretends to agree, but you can tell who's side they're on by what they comply with. 

DEXs have fortunately improved a lot over the past few years. Here's a [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8FraG0Hb2A) of XMR being converted to LN BTC on XMR.to, and BTC being sent via Lightning to a non-custodial Stakenet DEX wallet where it is then swapped into LTC without trace.

Side note, I know the XMR community and even devs have expressed interest in adopting Lightning in some way and I'm very eager to see that happen down the road. If XMR becomes Lightning swappable, then the entire LN and ERC ecosystems will be able to benefit from its immediate obfuscation.",2020-08-31 12:08:22

g3ewv0e,_Last_Man_Standing_,3,"Socialism = public sector centrally regulated economy  
Bitcoin = makes it impossible to centrally regulate shit

When this modern world wide ""Petro-dollar socialism"" falls apart and The Dollar dies.... Bitcoin will take a big part of the money market (along side gold and silver).  
And Bitcoin makes Agorism so fucking easy... and it makes Taxation extremely hard...

Central planers will have only 2 options: let people be free... or double down on tyranny just to be able to tax people like they used to. Like full on Owrellian surveillance just to keep tabs on peoples spending.  
So some countries will go a lot more Libertarian, and some will go full Commie.

Libertarian countries will be a lot more successful and in the long run people copy successful systems even if they don't understand them.

I can see the world in 100-200 years without socialism and Bitcoin will facilitate the transition.

Some thing I can predict for sure like:  
\- the dollar will die  
\- bitcoin will take a part of the money market  
\- bitcoin makes taxation extremely difficult  
\- statists will have to double down on tyranny in some/most countries  
\- some countries will go Libertarian   
\- people imitate stuff that works  
and it's enough to see the death of Socialism

but I can't even begin to imagine how will the block chain technology look in 10-20 or 100-200 years.  
It's the early days. And the same way you couldn't imagine smartphones in 1991 when the internet was starting I can't even begin to imagine how AWESOME Crypto will become.

But the sky is the limit if you remember Hayek's knowledge problem.  
When Bitcoin goes mainstream. It will be the first time in the history of the planet that ALL 8 billion people will be connected in the same free market. (there is about 2B people today that don't have access to banking at all and a lot more are underbanked)

This means that the internet and BTC will for the first time in the history connect the Knowledge (thru prices) of 8 billion people in one GIANT FREE-MARKET BRAIN .  
It's going to be sweet. :)  


ps.  
This is the short version, but I hope it helps see where I'm coming from when I say ""socialism is dead"".",2020-08-31 08:51:01
