fwj3mqx,GhostSierra117,18,"Hijacking top comment sorry.

VPN companies do what you could call a ""test""-advertisement.

Basically they reach out to YouTubers, people who blog etc pp. and tell them that they should test and review the VPN services. These people get a code, for example ""VPN-blog3"".

On www.vpn-blog3.notadomain you then read a ""test"" that NordVPN is super good etc and you even get a buttload of discount if you use the code ""VPN-blog3"".

Now NordVPN knows where you're coming from. And the dude from VPN-blog3 now recievers a share of what you bought, because he basically referred you to NordVPN.



As far as I'm aware mullvad is the only VPN service who do not do that. You don't even need a damn mail address. You can pay via bitcoin, check and other fairly private options. No logs, nothing. 5 bucks flat per month.

fwizek2,nullc,5,"Yes, I'm angry. I'm angry that despicable scammers like you fraudulently trade on the Bitcoin name and prey on the technical ignorance of ordinary people to enrich yourselves at their expense.

&gt;  that Bitcoin Cash exists ... not in consensus when SW activated

BCH (or BCC as it was called then, until someone realized that using the same name to help offload bitconnect bags had bad optics) existed well before then, ever since it was created by Bitmain in a naked takeover attempt that ultimately caused them more than a billion dollars in losses.

The lesson you should take away from that is: Fuck with bitcoin, get wreaked.

When segwit activated &gt;90% of nodes were running segwit enforcing software (when bcash was created too).  And fortunately, the remaining 10% weren't screwed because segwit is backwards compatible.

In the last BCash hardfork only about half the nodes were compatible the rest were knocked off the network, out of consensus. LOL.  Similar happened in prior forks and as a result BCH is now down to just a few hundred nodes.  Originally you and your co-scammers bragged about many implementations, but most of them have been forked off the network through your ""upgrades"" and are now unusable. There is even BSV which was created because BCH's authorities insisted on forcing CTOR-- still unused years later-- onto everyone, other implementations like ""bitcoin xt"" just gave up in response.

&gt; and upgrade on schedule just like Bitcoin did from the beginning

Bitcoin was never hardforked by Satoshi-- upgrades have always been done the same way in bitcoin: via softforks.

&gt; so back to my original statement that the actual space usage of SW blocks is hidden with accounting tricks

Repeating your lie without any basis or substantiation doesn't make your lie any more true or convincing.  I showed everyone outright how the actual size is computed and displayed right there, unmolested and unhidden in the size field returned in the bitcoin software.

What have you shown? *absolutely nothing*.  Instead you just tell the same tired old lies over and over again. Boring and  repetitive. ""BEEP BOOP BCASH IS THE REAL BITCOIN. SEGWIT IS FLAWED AND HAS TECHNICAL DEBT BEEP BOOP. INSERT COIN TO CONTINUE."" 

And we're left back at the original point. You fraudulently claimed that because of segwit, if Bitcoin were to hardfork to a larger blocksize limit it would saddled with using more resources for the same limit compared to just directly making that hardfork in the first place.  This is an extraordinary baseless lie which you keep repeating to convince your victims that the shitcoins you're selling them aren't shit.

If some blocksize hardfork didn't want to use weight and instead wanted to limit itself on the size of the standard on-disk serialization, it simply would do so-- and wouldn't be any more complicated as a result of the history. Your claim is a lie, plain and simple.

The fact that you and the various bcash developers spread and allow lies like this to persist demonstrates your complete absence of integrity and ethics.  The result forms part of an *ethical debt* that bcash will never be able to recover from.

&gt; actual space usage has a cost, a cost that is hidden with accounting tricks that is more than just a getblocksize

You ninjaed in this sentence-- but the size returned in the interface is the actual complete and total size on disk. There is no hidden anything there.  I chose a specific block as an example. If I was being untruthful about its size you could counter with whatever size you claim it actually has.  But I am not.  The size returned there is just the size... the actual size, the space it takes up on an unpruned full node. There is no greater size or hidden cost there. There is no interaction with pruning, or segwit or anything else. It's just the size.

I *know* you know all this already, but people read lies like yours and get tricked because they can't believe that someone would be so audacious to tell such obvious lies with such confidence. This exactly how they are tricked by Wright.  ... I am so fucking sick and tired of it.

You need to stop the bullshit now, dirtbag.

How about we agree to a wager?  I say the size of 0000000000000000000b83dd8b5891ba9dffa52b0f17b5a571e00c5d9feb8124 on disk is 1142782 bytes, just as my node reports in the size field of the getblock command.

What terms do you suggest?

Come on, DaSpawn, SHOW ME THE BLOCKSIZE.

fwm8jcw,Armor_of_Inferno,49,"I've told this story on Reddit before, but this might illustrate why Primerica is particularly bad.

I blame Primerica for the death of my best friend.

His name was Vance, and we'd been bros since he moved to town at age 13.  He was smart, witty, and had the kind of technical savvy that would have made him a Bitcoin millionaire.  Unfortunately he developed brain cancer at age 17, and had to have some pretty serious surgeries to fix it, but he came out in full remission.  He needed regular brain imaging every 6 months to ensure he stayed in remission, and if not, so that they could catch it early enough to treat him.

Vance was unfortunately surrounded by family who were all trying to get rich quick.  He had pulled me into my first pyramid scheme at age 18.  Selling long distance calling cards, if you can believe that.  The 90's were a weird time.   Anyway, we'd both been around the MLM block and knew what to watch out for.

Primerica was different though.  He asked me to go with him to a group interview at age 23, and they looked very different from the other schemes we'd been pulled into.   They were part of Citigroup at the time, and they sold financial products like life insurance and mutual funds.  Their pitch was that they'd get you licensed to sell stuff like that, and that seemed tempting.  Yep, the course would cost money, and so would the test, but then you'd be off to a career that would make you a millionaire by age 30.

It set off my red flag sensor, because they ""hired"" all 15 people who were in the ""group interview"" with us.  I saw that most of the people in that room were not people I would hire, and knew something was fishy.  He couldn't be deterred, though, and signed up.   He still worked his day job, but he spent all his free time trying to recruit family members and sell stocks and life insurance to friends and family who were dirt poor.  Other than trying to recruit me every few months, we didn't talk about it much.

A year later I got him a great job working in a call center.  Yep, call center jobs suck, but compare that to cold calling people to sell them a pyramid scheme and it starts to look like a dream job.   He worked out well in the company, and had full health insurance.

He lasted 6 months, and then quit so he could work Primerica full time, because his upline told him the reason he wasn't succeeding was that he wasn't working enough hours.  These were the same people who rented Ferraris by the hour to show up at a potential client/employee's house to look rich, all while living in one bedroom apartments. 

Eventually Vance had to move in with his wife's parents (out of state) because he couldn't make rent on his own, and of course had no health insurance.   He stopped getting those preventative brain scans because he couldn't afford them -- *yet*.  He would have no problem paying for them just as soon as he ""built his company"", and was always saying that it was just a few months over the horizon.   

One day Vance suddenly couldn't get out of bed, and he was sick beyond sick.  His brain cancer had returned, and was at that point inoperable.  I saw him once before he died when he was on hospice care, and he could only stay awake for about 3 minutes.   I will never forget his funeral, where I watched his devastated wife - pregnant with their kid - being restrained by family members while she tried to stop the officiant from closing his casket for the last time.  That shit haunts me, man.  

He died of a tumor that likely was preventable had he kept his health insurance.  Instead, the bastards he worked for at Primerica convinced him to believe in a fake reality, a dream that even they would never achieve.

So Primerica is particularly evil, because it looks like legitimate work.   It has a cult culture that thrives on looking successful, and it can fool even brilliant people who should know better into selling everything they own at a shot to be rich.  A shot that will never happen.

Fuck Primerica.",2020-07-02 04:45:59

fwlqf6i,sekniqi,4,"I hear you. However, I also want to make sure that these concerns are fairly framed within the right context. Ideologically, no matter how much one would like for this to be the case, Avalanche simply cannot achieve the same level of maturity as Ethereum or Bitcoin within a few months or even a year. Avalanche is a powerful piece of tech, but it is still early. Time is a must in order for the ecosystem to develop to its full potential. 

A metropolis is NOT built in a day. It takes time.

To your point about Avalanche being centralized, I think it's very important to offer some clarifications:

&gt; 1. STAKING: You guys will own the vast majority of all the tokens thus also all the staking rewards!

The foundation's mission for staking is security, not economic gain. The foundation is will be taking all the steps needed to ensure staking rewards to go to the community. More details on this to come soon. The foundation is exploring various mechanisms, including a potential burn of the staking rewards from ALL coins minted by the foundation. 

&gt; 2 &amp; 3 FUNDING &amp; GOVERNANCE

In my opinion, the main priority for Avalanche should be to launch a network that solves the biggest challenges in crypto and DeFi today (transaction velocity, latency, security, network congestion, costly hardware requirements, etc.) AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, and start accumulating a large base of builders. Community of token holders is incredibly important, but in my opinion, a singular distribution event through token sales seems counter-productive to the long term benefits of Avalanche. 

Governance is on the roadmap, but launching a network that solves all of those issues is most critical as it's what has been holding the entire ecosystem back. I worry personally very much about governance, and I think Avalanche's future development MUST (not should) be democratic. As long as anyone of the team members have any influence whatsoever, it must be the case that the community is to be listened to in full. 

&gt; 3. DEVELOPMENT: You guys are the sole developers of the avalanche client and network code, as there are no other independent teams. Ethereum has over easily over 10 INDEPENDENT development teams. Tezos has like 4. Cardano has 2 or 3 as well. Monero has several.

Comparing Avalanche to networks with multiple years of lead time isn't exactly apples to oranges, although I'd argue Avalanche holds up incredibly well. It's taken the Ava Labs team less than a year to be on the cusp of mainnet with more functionality than many networks you mention have now. There's also a Python implementation underway (very advanced), and a Rust implementation that is starting soon (from independent party). 

But, we unquestionably agree that expanding the developer network on Avalanche is paramount to future success. That's why we focused the distribution and token structure to reward developers and stakers who participate in the protocol, over fueling speculators who don't create value on the network.",2020-07-02 02:30:45

fwm8o5n,sph44,4,"My favourite part about Craig is that 4 years ago after the Gizmodo article &amp; all the attention, he promised to show proof, but on the day he was supposed to do it he said ""sorry, I'm not strong enough..."" (ostensibly he did not want the attention) and failed to do it.  

Around that time, he gave an interview saying he did not want any public attention, and after the interview he would no longer comment publicly about Bitcoin or his role in it ""ever"".  4 years later he is non-stop giving speeches and making videos loudly proclaiming he is Satoshi, but still without signing a message from a known SN block.

fwrhlr6,fully_completely,16,"**Full, long** detailed summary:

Morgan says there will be 2-3 parts of this tell-all.

**July 1st 2020:**

\- Says it is really difficult when you’re with an abusive person and that their goal is to control you and isolate you from you friends, that they make you feel like they’re the only person there for you and like you are codependent. Her friends and family pulled her aside within 6 months to say they were worried about her and they’ve seen a change in her and she disregarded it and Evan told her that they were jealous and they all sucked.

\- Says she felt guilty when her mom and her friends called. Felt guilty if she hung out with anyone but Evan.

\- Says she was distanced from her friends and family, Evan would question her while she was on the phone even though she was talking to them right in front of him. Accused her of talking about him.

\- She says he manipulates any situation to fit his narrative.

\- Rachel from first season said that Evan was gaslighting her during their season, Morgan sided with Evan back then and felt bad.

**Sometime April 2020:** Here the video splits to different time/video where she is very emotional and crying. 

\- Says it was all real for her and really fell in love. Was scared to say anything because she knew how Evan would manipulate the situation

\- Says he is so good at making people feel sympathy for him. She still does it.

\- Said he was like this before his family tragedy, and that he has two brothers that aren’t pathological liars so that’s not the reason he’s like this. Called him a master manipulator. Gave an example, said she was making dinner, cutting vegetables and her friend and Evan were making fun of her saying she was going to cut her hand. She did in that moment, everyone was laughing, Evan was being SO sweet. It was a funny and cute memory for her. Turns out he told his and some of her friends that she cut her hand on purpose, blamed him and said she spread the blood on him. Said things like this happened often, daily. Would turn things around to where she would feel bad for him.

\- Evan bragged on the show about his accomplishments, trust funds, businesses (restaurants in LA, Hawaii), travelling, having millions in bitcoin. She told him he didn’t need to brag about these things, he said his family needs him and Kaci steals from him all the time and only wants handbags. This is where she fell in love with him. They were all lies.

\- Covered why she took care of him financially. Said she had signs. When they got back he said Kaci stole all his money and shut off his phone. Morgan says here that Kaci supported him for their entire relationship. Morgan paid for everything at that point. Says he told her that he would pay her back when he got the trust fund. He was supposed to get it in 2020. He broke up with her Dec 27th which was days before he would have gotten his trust fund.

\- She is crying here, implies she was broken when he left her. Things were good until they got so serious that his lies were bound to come out.

\- Evans moms called Morgans mom. Convo was normal, her mom told his mom that he was sad because he was under so much pressure because his mom and 2 brothers keep asking for money. She was all “whoa whoa whoa” and said it was all lies.

\- Morgan talked to his mom and his mom begged her not to leave him. Morgan wasn’t even considering it at this point. His mom told her that he had a problem lying since he was younger. The mom told her she was the only one who could help him and change him.

**OVERALL SUMMARY OF HIS LIES:**

* he owns 3 mansions that he allows his mother and 2 brothers to live on for free while he was in LA. Said his mother was irresponsible with money
* Owned a restaurant chain in Hawaii, and a restaurant in LA
* 3 Million dollars in Bitcoin
* 3 Million dollars in a trust fund his dad left for him
* Graduated College and was the star of basketball team
* The guys from their season thought Evan was a millionaire until she told them all
* Lives in a high rise in LA",2020-07-03 10:58:43

fwqmibm,SarangNoether,6,"It's time for my monthly research report for June. As always, my thanks to the community for ongoing support of research in applied cryptography.

Research this month focused primarily on major updates to the CLSAG security model, proofs, and preprint in response to initial results from the ongoing review; as well as work on an analysis toolkit for obtaining useful data from the blockchain.

The [CLSAG](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/654) linkable ring signature construction is currently undergoing [formal review](https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/ccs-proposals/-/merge_requests/150) by [JP Aumasson](https://aumasson.jp/) and [Antony Vennard](https://diagprov.ch/). The review is being conducted in two stages: the first to assert the correctness and applicability of the underlying mathematics and security model presented in the preprint, and the second to examine the implementation code for correctness and robustness. The reviewers found no major issues with the preprint, finding that the mathematics are correct and the security model reasonable. However, they made many suggestions for minor corrections and changes, as well as requested that some of the proofs be expanded for clarity. In particular, the proof that non-slanderability and unforgeability are equivalent has been entirely rewritten. Further, one of the cryptographic hardness assumptions has been reverted to another from an earlier draft with minor modifications. Finally, I completely overhauled and rewrote the proof of linkable anonymity security. Once the reviewers complete the second stage of the review process, they will release a final report that will be posted publicly. In the meantime, the reviewers and I have been discussing some of the specifics of their initial draft report. The revised preprint will be posted to the [IACR archive](https://eprint.iacr.org/) after additional review.

After reading a [preprint](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/593) that looked at deducible transactions and related statistics from the Monero blockchain, I decided to independently verify the results. This grew into a [Python toolkit](https://github.com/SarangNoether/skunkworks/tree/tracing) that can be used to extract block, transaction, input, and output data from local block explorers for analysis. The results have been useful; in particular, the analysis showed that while a nonzero number of recent transactions are deducible (that is, they are susceptible to so-called chain reaction analysis), all such transactions spend old funds generated prior to the confidential transaction protocol upgrade. Indeed, precisely zero confidential transactions are deducible. This analysis led to ongoing discussion with the preprint authors, who confirmed the results and are making further updates to their work; several of their conclusions are rendered incorrect by this transaction classification.

The analysis toolkit was also used to analyze spend age patterns. Early [work](https://maltemoeser.de/paper/monerolink.pdf) by Andrew Miller and collaborators examined these patterns in deducible Monero transactions and on the Bitcoin blockchain; their work led to the implementation of updated output selection algorithms. My updated analysis further examined whether coinbase outputs follow the same distribution, and how the distribution changed over time among deducible transactions. Results indicate that while there is variation over time, the spend age distribution reasonably matches the output selection distribution used by default, and that coinbase outputs follow the same distribution very closely. Ongoing work is in progress to conduct additional analysis using the toolkit.

On an unrelated note, I delivered a presentation to a cryptography study group held by [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/en/) at the group's invitation. This was a great opportunity to give an overview of how cryptographic constructions and building blocks are used to produce privacy-focused transaction protocols.

And now on to Sarang's Reading Corner, a short listing of some interesting papers that I have come across this month. The appearance of a paper in this list does not mean that I necessarily agree with its contents or correctness, or that I endorse it. Papers are in no particular order.

I’ve had boosts here and there (including finding info to access a bitcoin wallet I thought I had lost in 2011 containing a handful of full btc.) The extra income from the pandemic unemployment certainly helped, as it ended up being close to a grand more a month than I was making previously, and I was doing just fine before the unemployment boost, so I just invested that as well. I grew up poor as dirt and I knew that to escape I had to do the opposite of what my parents did.

That's what I said.  When individual transaction, median fees were at the same level with Bitcoin, bch proponents mocked it.  Free pass for ethereum though.

&gt;The bitinfocharts stats disagree

They disagree with the cost and speed of a LN transaction?

&gt;and the size of the blockchain is irrelevant to this debate

No, its entirely relevant.  Its a hidden cost and.its how ethereum is able to provide ""cheap"" transactions - by pushing that cost onto full nodes.

&gt;So it's either not trusting a websites with objective stats, or taking your (biased) word for it. We're talking about transaction fee revenue, and the 4.5 TB size is irrelevant to that.

Se above.

&gt;Yes, because LN isn't what's being measured

Then you're ignoring a huge part of the scaling methodology for Bitcoin.  This conversation and any maths based stats are entirely irrelevant. 

&gt;We're specifically talking about fee revenue on-chain.

No, you are, not we.

&gt;One could argue the same for Ethereum since they already have L2 solutions too, so your point has no merit.

There seems to be an overlap between coinerism and the alt right. How prevalent it is I'm not sure, but the conjunction of anti-government sentiment, libertarian economic ideas etc does seem to point to cryptocurrency being more ""of the right"" than the left.

fwwcbyb,TheCamerlengo,1,"This is  the answer. Gold allows you to buy into a new monetary system. Funny how the redditor crowd is so skeptical of gold. Gold is a crappy investment, but an excellent store of value. One of the reasons older cultures used gold for jewelery, easy to carry it with you if you have to flee. 

In the 1920s gold was in the 200s per ounce. 100 years later it is around 1600-1700 an ounce. Not a super great investment, but it kept it's value as compared to any currency. 

Bitcoin probably works too, but seems overpriced and more prone to bubbles. Also governments can more easily lock it down so that they can either track transfers or prevent wallets from leaving the country.",2020-07-04 21:36:35
fwwbfx5,Btcyoda,1,"I my mind this period, before the next run, will probably be looked back at as the last chance a average person could still 'easily' get one whole Bitcoin.
When pushed several Bitcoins would have been possible.

After next bull run we probably see the lows of some $10-20k.
Could be some less could be some more, if financial markets start dying it could be we see a real dip again, could also mean we will never see those low prices again...

Those prices, $10-20k, would mean an average guy would have to pour in most of his savings at once at such a dip to be able to get one whole coin.

But for most their mental barrier, ""I missed out"" will be the biggest problem to get any significant amount, until they again mentally surrender and buy in, forced, at even higher prices.

It's not what I want to happen or that I don't want them to get Bitcoin,  it's just how these psychological things work (on an average).

It's a scenario I have now for some time, but it's not more than a wild guess.... Especially if our current system starts cracking everything is possible....",2020-07-04 21:23:52

I don't use Binance, but I don't think it will be possible for you to pay directly from them because you usually don't know where your payment is coming from if you are using an exchange.

Just get yourself a free wallet, withdraw from Binance to that wallet, and make the payment from there. I don't use a free wallet so I can't suggest one to you, just make sure to do your research so you get a legit one.

When you have your wallet there should be an option to receive bitcoin, click that and it will give you an address. When you click withdraw on Binance, it will want an address to send to. Use your receiving address for that.

Now when you want to pay the vendor from your personal wallet, you send it to the address that they provided you, and where they want your address, give them the one you received Bitcoin on, the same one you provided to Binance to withdraw to.

It might seem complicated all spelled out, but it's really not. Just go slow and don't rush anything. Get the hang of it and feel free to ask questions if you get stuck. There are no stupid questions when you are making sure your money is safe.",2020-07-05 03:43:15

For any newbies coming here wondering why there is so much propaganda and lies, propagated by possibly paid trolls such as OP, I would like to spread awareness about this issue,

There are many signs that BTC has been infiltrated. When you put them all together, it starts to form a clearer picture. Here are some examples.

There is consistent trolls/harassments/smear campaigns against Bitcoin Cash the last 2 years. Who is funding all these propaganda campaigns?

In 2013, Peter Todd was paid off by a government intelligence agent to create RBF, create a propaganda video, and cripple the BTC code.

Blockstream kicking Gavin, the lead Bitcoin developer, out of Bitcoin development, successfully hijacked control over the Bitcoin github.

Mike Hearn and Gavin wanted to prevent Bitcoin from being hijacked, so they created a fork. That fork didn't survived after they were heavily DDOS. Mike Hearn was heavily character assassinated by what I believe to be orchestrated paid campaigns by Blockstream.

I was involved in some BCH projects and there had been multiple DDOS attacks and other stuff, such as flooding my inbox with few hundred thousand emails per day. I'm sure those activities are not for profit, so why are they doing it?

There are actually plenty more nasty unethical things BTC people had done which is not covered in this comment. Bitcoin Cash is an attempt to rescue what the bad actors had hijacked successfully, mainly the peer to peer cash revolution. And it won't be the last time the bad actors will try to find ways to sabotage this project.

fwwqt2j,Kumomax1911,1,"There is actually a monetary incentive to vote for smaller pools, but the problem being solved is much larger than you've envisioned and the problem were left with is much smaller than Bitcoin.

Binance can and will open as many pools as would be most profitable for them. Voting on each pool will reach a saturation point of profit and Binance should should easily have enough ADA to hit that balance. Let's say they need 3 pools to maximize their staking. Now Binance controls 4 out of 50 pools,100 pools, 200 pools? Remember, less than half a dozen pools have 50% control over Bitcoin. Around 6 entities have obtained a controllable amount of network authority the last time I checked. 

Meanwhile, Binance can't come close to controlling 50% of the Cardano chain. The reason is because it would cost too much to own 51% of all pools while their ""votes"" are best used on themselves and can't be shared. This is what broke EOS, and why EOS is only a couple simple steps away from working governance. Every vote on EOS is actually capable of being shared with 28 friends. Huobi, Binance, Newdex and all the other exchanges running as EOS ""pools"" would unlikely make any governance change that would destroy their vote sharing and selling. They then would lose their monetary control.

The slow pace of Cardano development is clearly going to be rewarded by breaking the ""You scratch my back and I'll scratch your back"" agreements between pools, but are exchanges still voting for themselves going to be secure enough to protect the network? Well, It works for Bitcoin and not everyone can make pools or meaningfuly vote on the Bitcoin network.

Every miner running a Bitcoin  farm is a vote for themselves. Unfortunately, for Bitcoin you now only have inventive to mine with expensive and specialized hardware that's unattainable by the average person. Furthermore, the hardware is all produced in China. Does that seem very decentralized? Yet, it still works. The reason it still works is because voting for yourself means you will also need skin in the game. The point here is to make sure Binance has increased skin in the game for each unit of authority they obtain, they do not have value to buy 51% of all running pools (The ADA coin price would increase too much), and ensure they can't share/sell that authority with their associates. 

It seems cardano is accomplishing all of the above with their structure of pools, but can it be more decentralized? Likely. Creating locked voting would help. The longer your willing to lock your stake, by voting, the more your vote is actually worth. This could mean that the average holder has the option of being heard as loud as larger holders if they're willing to lock their ADA for long periods of time. An option bad acting exchanges could never choose with their customers funds because they need their ADA to stay much more liquid. 

So no.. Cardano hasn't allowed everyone an equal slice of it's authority. Though, it's still provides one of the best playing fields for fairness while keeping the network secure. Besides, some would argue that you always deserve a little more authority when you have more skin to lose.",2020-07-05 00:15:36

fwy6ywp,dcwj,1,"To preface the rest of this comment: my perspective is very biased. I’m quite comfortable with taking high-risk bets on future technologies, and being an “innovator” (the segment of customer that comes even before “early adopter”), so my perspective is definitely a very optimistic one, and I could be way off base with this. (But on the other hand, I *am* quoted in a book about blockchains by an author who predicted smartphones, so I might have *some* sense in this area...sorry for the not-so-humble brag.)

I’m from Toronto and living in Vancouver right now. I’ve only got one hotspot at the moment, but it’s earning roughly 100 USD per month so far. For the first few weeks, it was just in my apartment and wasn’t close enough to any other hotspots in the city to participate in or witness challenges, so it was essentially operating solo. During that period, it was earning about 6 or 7 HNT per day. I recently moved it to a friend's apartment where it's closer to a couple other hotspots, and now it's earning closer to 10 HNT per day.

Right now, HNT is going for about .45 USD, and I’ve seen other people say that 6 or 7 HNT is pretty standard for a hotspot in an area without anything else around it. I think even assuming the token price and the earnings per-hotspot stay within similar ranges to where they are today, the proposition already seems worth it to me, especially considering that you don't really have to do any work other than plugging it in and leaving in on a windowsill.

On a spectrum from pessimistic to neutral to optimistic, that's somewhere between neutral and pessimistic, and it's already a pretty solid proposition: it should pay for itself in roughly 6 months, assuming the per-hotspot earnings don't drop too drastically as new ones come online.

And when I start to daydream a bit about where this project could go on the optimistic side is when I start getting really excited. What happens to the token price if Bitcoin goes on another bull run and brings a lot of mainstream attention to the crypto space? Or when it starts getting listed on some of the big name crypto exchanges and more crypto investors start speculating on it? (Especially once some of the ""crypto influencers"" start hyping up how it's an IoT company from the inventor of Napster, and backed by high profile investors like Google Ventures! There aren't a lot of projects in the crypto space that can claim that kind of legitimacy.)

Also, if the Helium network captures a significant chunk of IoT demand, that'll put positive pressure on the HNT price, since Data Credits can only be created by burning HNT.

And any increases in token price aside, the idea of having multiple hotspots covering one area (and maybe even forming a consensus group) is still really exciting, since once they've paid for themselves, everything on top is gravy. I have a few more on order to put around Vancouver, and a couple ordered to put at a few friends' places in Toronto (East York).

I think it'll quickly become a game of real estate where people will be racing to own the future IoT earnings potential of the 300 metres surrounding well-positioned windowsills (since hotspots need to be 300m apart).

I personally think if you can afford it, it's worth taking a risk on it right now. We're still in the period before the opportunity becomes obvious. I've seen people in the community Slack channel say that participating in this community gives them a similar feeling to participating in the Bitcoin community in the early days (back when people used to say ""Yeah cool, but it's not really worth anything."")

I personally am looking at it as a hobby project that may or may not pay itself off. Getting involved in IoT technology is pretty exciting to me even if Helium doesn't become ""the next Bitcoin"" or anything. (I even bought a domain and started working on [a side project](https://helium.plus) related to Helium).

I know it can be hard to take crypto projects seriously after the euphoria and delusion of 2017, but I think Helium will be to the ICO implosion as Amazon was to the dot com crash. (And Brave will be the Google, but that's for another discussion.)",2020-07-05 08:21:36

Everytime I passed a certain amount of cash on hand (5 mill when I started out) I used the surplus money to buy graphics cards. I had the bitcoin farm up at 35 graphics cards in 3 weeks.

I never lost money after reaching 35 graphics card, and I didnt see the need to max out graphics card on it.

Now things have changed since last wipe. For example you could sell empty 2x2 fuel canisters and buy them again at about the same price (= free fuel).

fx3j2j6,behindtext,1,"&gt; The arrogance to claim Decred ""can't be forked"".

the senior devs and myself have never once claimed Decred cannot be forked. if this claim is being made, it would be helpful to know who is making it and where. the intent of our consensus change system is to make it very expensive to maintain a minority fork, not to make it impossible, per the [blog entry on the consensus change system from November 2016](https://blog.decred.org/2016/11/16/Upgrading-Consensus/).

&gt; And Company Zero centralization is (part of?) why Coinbase's lawyers put the kibosh on listing DCR.

this is outright FUD and is incorrect.

&gt; Decred's C-level executives never miss a chance to purity spiral

anyone who pays any attention to the project knows we have no ""C-level executives"", so this is more FUD.

&gt; The excruciating, sluggish-to-glacial pace of development.

we have more dev deliverables between the work before launch and since than most projects valued in Bs of USD. whether anyone pays attention to this work is clearly another matter. projects like Cardano have taken years to deliver working PoS (is it even live on mainnet?) and Ethereum has been talking about it for 6 years now with no delivery in sight.

&gt; I've always known btcd/btcdsuite is c0's bill-paying day job and DCR is more of a hobby vanity project built in the garage on slow weekends.

this is not even close to correct. btcsuite never generated any revenue for Conformal Systems or Company 0, which is precisely why we created Decred: there is a massive tragedy of the commons in the Bitcoin dev space. all work performed by CS and C0 has been bankrolled by me, personally, apart from contractor pay from the treasury. work slowed on btcsuite throughout 2014-2016 and completely stopped by late 2016, and the project is currently maintained by Lightning Labs and has been since 2017.  C0 spends the majority of its time working on Decred and has since early 2016.

if your claim that you've been here since launch is true, you're probably one of the most misinformed people i've ever interacted with. what strikes me as far more probable is that you're here to spread FUD.

if you don't like the way the project has been going, you're always welcome to exit your position, but showing up here and spreading what i'm pretty certain is disinformation is not going to help the project. we can't be held responsible for the extent to which you are mis/dis-informed.",2020-07-06 22:38:33

Either they are running a few pieces of gear so they can secure a scav kill, or they aren't playing.  I wouldn't exactly call those games hardcore either, but yes I agree Tarkov isn't exactly all that punishing.    


I think people have it backwards, you cannot expect to be succesfull if you have severe gear fear.  Not running that kit except for a special occasion is probably hindering people more than they know.  People who loot run are equally being selfish, just in a different way and spout the ""let me play how I want to play"" as a justification for doing something the devs are actively trying to undermine and remove.    


Yes I did say I was salty about it.  I don't care about people taking loot or money out, I care about people effectively wasting server slots to play solo.  These are the same people who add me and call me a piece of shit for killing them.  Because their experience is one that is completely seperate from the multiplayer aspect of the game.    


I would put money on people not running loadouts being far more rooted in fear of losing money than of actually being able to run kits.  There is probably a very small percentage who are running a sub 10% survival rate and cannot for the life of them make money and resort to loot runs.  Either they are new and this will pass, or the game just isn't for them/they need to practice in a different way.  But these are probably as much an outlier as a popular streamer or people similar in ability etc.    


Because it's a format designed to be played against other players, otherwise it wouldn't be online with 4-14 people on a server all able to kill eachother.  I don't see how people are so defensive over every server having multiple people just running in and out as quickly as possible without gear or with just a pistol and see it as a positive aspect of the game.  Entire front page of this subreddit is just people whinging about every tiny change to their ability to do this, saying bitcoin is useless, this is impossible etc etc.  And they are endlessly wrong, they are just playing the game in a way that makes it harder for themselves to even survive against a piss weak AI scav.

Amount of money you want to make / VET you hold = Target VET price

speculated bitcoin value / speculated future vet price = target price in Sats

Circulating supply of VET * VET price = current or speculative VET market cap (value of all coins)

Current VET market cap / Market cap of all crypto = VET market share (use this to speculate on both the price increasing and the usage of VET increasing relative to other cryptos).

Future VET selling price / the cost basis of your investment = ""multiple"" on your money

Multiple on your money - 1 = % capital gain or loss

1 - (Your wallet ranking/Total wallets) = Your percentile placement among all holders.

The lack of price action (bart) to me is something good - as it stabilizes price action (the bbands and volatility). Bitcoin being Bitcoin, doesn't like it. It's like trying to keep a kitten inside a pen for a long time, after a while it'll figure its way out.

That movement out of this 9k-10k is what the entire trading community is waiting for. So yes, I do think something is going to happen to get us above or below.

The majority of sentiment that I've seen is that if it goes down, it'll follow fib levels as low as $6000something, to something above $10500.

If it breaks $8800, I expect a lot of traders to buy the dip, and investors to buy as well. The further the dip, the more action as people scoop up bitcoin at a ""discount"", with the sentiment being ""anything below $10k is good in the long term"".

If it breaks $10500, you'll see FOMO hit and people jump in resulting in a wild ride.

The elephant in the room is the Fed - specifically liquidity/inflation/etc... 

Personally, I think we're going to see higher highs in the equities markets since Trump wants to get reelected, and after the recession I feel like the crash will happen.

Shortly after Blockstream was [incorporated](https://archive.is/qzsVe), they received [$50 million](https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/blockstream-series-unknown--66d2817a#section-investors) in venture capital from AXA, Khosla Ventures, Horizon Ventures, etc., some of the most powerful venture firms in the world.

The Bitcoin name and repository were hijacked by a for-profit organisation so they could make a buck on their own patented and convoluted ""solution"" for a problem that doen't even exist (in fact; they themselves created it). In this process, Bitcoin (BTC) was turned into an altcoin by implementing SegWit (the coin itself is no longer a “chain of digital signatures,” as per Fig. 1 of the white paper).

Luckily, Bitcoin as described in the whitepaper by it's inventor Satoshi Nakamoto continues to exist under the name Bitcoin Cash before BTC forked off with SegWit. It uses the superior scaling solution as described by Satoshi and keeps all transactions Peer-to-Peer on the blockchain.

TLDR: [Blockstream fucked Bitcoin over](https://youtu.be/jctc85X_PCI?t=79) and r/Bitcoin bans people talking about it.

fxgxi1d,Excal2,5,"&gt;What is it about crypto that puts people at odds like this?

Basically the people at the top  of the crypto pyramid, for years, pumped and dumped bitcoin alternately with other cryptocurrencies. I've heard them referred  to as  ""seasons"" as in ""it's bitcoin season"" which means bitcoin is getting juiced before a massive sell off and reinvestment into an alt-coin like Monero. The alt-coin of choice would change season to season, but a given alt-coin's community would take their pump season as evidence that they were superior to all other alt-coins.

""One coin to rule them all"" kind of thinking, because if you were in on the right coin that managed to survive long term (this never happened because once the  pump was done all the money was moved back to the now reduced-price bitcoin) then you'd be  one of the next cryptocurrency millionaires that totally exist all over the place and it's so easy dude your computer does all the work why would you *not* be doing this?!

The people at the bottom of the pyramid thus became very  competitive  and political with one another based on what season it was and what coins were doing well, this was especially prevalent for  communities whose coins managed to kinda survive the dump at the end of a season and become actually self-sustaining  for a period of time like Monero.

“In a scheme to raise hundreds of millions of dollars defendants illegally sold useless XRP tokens to retail investors around the globe.”

Is it just me or does that just sound off?  And reaching?  

“Useless XRP”. It just looks like a smear from the start, rife with agenda. 

But even with setting that aside, the fundamental argument which they are presenting right there, which is to say XRP is useless...

 (word choice is funny sometimes... they say ‘useless’ instead of ‘worthless’)

...XRP as it stands today is being used right now in actual production contracts across The world for remittances. 

Being used now. Today. Not useless. But actually being used for it’s created purpose. Not a security but a bridge asset that can source liquidity on demand when and where people need it. 

I keep seeing all of these posts... these quick little quips of ‘I don’t know any better’... XRP isn’t blockchain. 

Well... what is a block chain? What is it’s purpose? 

It is a distributed ledger. 

A record of transaction that doesn’t fall under one jurisdiction or one central control system. It is global and pretty much anyone can join. 

(Don’t split hairs with me here yes there is more to the description but what are we using it for really? To have an immutable record. One That is trustless and can be unchallenged. That is a powerful tool and there are a few ways of going about achieving that. Bitcoin does it by a Proof of work system. Etheruem is POW but is supposed to flip to Proof of stake any day now... will you say that ETH is not blockchain after the switch?  XRP achieves the same outcome with a method called consensus. So you can call it just a fancy Excel spreadsheet if you want but I would say that the same label could hit Bitcoin.  It’s a ledger. A record of transaction. That’s what this thing is.)

Ripple as a node operator lost a majority control to its network some time ago and the validators on the network, which behave like miners essentially for bitcoins blockchain, but for XRP, have recently passed rules that Ripple itself has no control over. 

Ripple is not centralized. Yes they have a lot of XRP in lockup. But tell me how that’s any different from Satoshi holding 1 million bitcoin in his/her/their wallet? 

At least we know who is in charge of that stash of XRP. 

And for anyone saying on the first of every month “Ripple DUMPS another BILLION XRP on the market....”

Just do your research. There is an escrow that releases to ripple 1 Billion XRP every month. Ripple has been sending most of it back into lockup for a while now. They take a little for their own purposes and send most of it back. 

At this point I still don’t see what the debate is. Bitcoin was positioned to be a payments network but we all know that it cannot handle that process. 

But hey... in a world where diamonds, Art, Jewelry, Baseball cards... and on and on can have value for its scarcity.... so then BTC can have its place and it works better than trying to move a piece of Art. 

When it comes to enterprise needs however... speed is key. 

XRP has a limited supply just like Bitcoin. It will actually reduce in supply over time.... and so it has scarcity. There will be no more XRP created. 

XRP is a “green currency” as in its power needs are minuscule. 

Bitcoin is a power hungry machine. 

And XRP can settle and be transferred in 3-5 seconds. 

Bitcoin takes HOURS at times to settle. 

So what’s the debate?  

XRP is faster. XRP is cheaper to use. XRP has a limited supply. XRP is regulatory compliant around the globe. (The US will get there). 

So again... I ask. What is the debate. 

Let Bitcoin go to $500,000 if that’s where people think it can go. I own some Bitcoin so that’s good for me. I think there is space in the world for both. 

But don’t tell me XRP is useless. These lawsuits are ridiculous. 

And also if you know your history about ripple they were already approached and FINED by FINCEN. Years ago when it looked like things might be questionable they were set right by the governing bodies. 

I just don’t like misinformation and blatant lies. There are a lot of people here that are trying to better themselves, especially in these times and when people outright just create false narratives it really bugs me. 

Tribalism is not the way and anyone that calls themselves a “Maximilast” when it comes to their token of choice... get off your high horse. We all need each other to get behind solid projects. 

If there is a real solution for a real problem then we all need to get behind those projects. They will make all of our lives better. 

Ripple as a company is doing a lot of good for the cryptosphere and the haters need to really understand those efforts.

Hey, if you think that's too much to predict, how about telling us when BSV intends to restore the original difficulty algorithm.

&gt;    (2) Bounded [sic] mining

Bonded mining is a bad idea. At a fundamental level, bonded mining is a workaround for a broken DAA. It's much better to *fix the bug* than to add a workaround on top of the bug while leaving the bug still in place.

Bonded mining is a bad idea for many reasons. Here's a few:

1. It's very complicated. It's about 10x as much code and as much work as simply fixing the DAA would be. Nobody has written that code yet. Nobody knows what it would look like. But it's a reasonable guess that it will be ugly.

2. it simply does not work with low-hashrate miners. The algorithm proposed in the bonded mining paper requires each miner to comprise at least 1% of the hashrate in order to have a decent success rate. This contribute to mining pool centralization. The Bonded Mining paper excuses this by saying: ""Smaller miners do not need to be excluded from the system as they can join a larger pool."" That's not a good excuse. Pool centralization is itself the problem.

3. It compromises the ability of miners to remain anonymous. By tying miners to their bonds, miners need to have all of their blocks be linked together. Basically, it forces address reuse. This compromises the censorship-resistance properties of Bitcoin, and makes miners more vulnerable to reprisal, such as in the event of World War 3.

Edit: It looks like you've linked to [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.00814.pdf) on bo**u**nded-time algorithms on cyber-physical systems in e.g. aerospace instead of [this UMass paper](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~gbiss/bonded_mining.pdf) on bonded mining in cryptocurrency systems.

fxtm88i,UomoGonfiatoDiArgon,16,"La dura realtà che abbiamo appreso da piccoli è che Fujiko era una grandissima troia. Tutta la sua dote consisteva nelle esagerate poppe e nella grande abilità a prostituirsi. Poi trova Lupin III, che è un po' coglione, fa la profumiera e il coglione ci casca sempre e si fa pure fregare spesso.

È stata fortunata anche perché Jigen e Goemon sono pressoché asex e aromantici e pure sfortunati con le donne (non ditemi che non avete notato che il primo ha un fedora e il secondo una katana). Sono professionisti che fanno il lavoro sporco al posto di Lupin. Lupin non è bravo, è solo fortunato, ma la fortuna non basta: ci vuole qualcuno che faccia materialmente il lavoro. Jigen e Goemon ne cavano in cambio un po' di amicizia cameratesca e pure una percentuale, se il colpo va a buon fine e Fujiko non li frega, ma non si capisce bene quando avranno mai tempo di godersi quei soldi.

Infine c'è Zenigata, il vecchio rimbambito di cui i superiori assecondano la noiosa e inconcludente fissazione di un'intera vita.

Sono passati tanti anni e quindi Zenigata è da presumere morto di vecchiaia (chissà, magari le sue ultime parole in punto di morte saranno state ""Lu Peeen"") e gli altri personaggi invecchiati. Anche Jigen andrebbe presunto morto, viste le abitudini quanto a tabacco e alcool: muscoli, riflessi e mente invecchiano più rapidamente, sarà avvenuto sicuramente la prima volta che non è riuscito a concentrarsi abbastanza in fretta o a centrare un bersaglio al primo colpo. Probabilmente anche Lupin è morto allo stesso modo, anche lui di morte anonima, non affatto eroica o spettacolare, forse addirittura in un letto d'ospedale ignorato da tutti, come un infartuato durante il lockdown. Goemon invece ai primi segni di vecchiaia si sarà ritirato in un monastero shintoista, forse senza neanche un centesimo, ma giurerei che morirà più che centenario dopo tante, tante, tante meditazioni.

Nonostante Fujiko venga presentata come atletica e abilissima nelle arti marziali, il calendario le avrà presto presentato il conto, le poppe si saranno ridotte a due vecchie ciabatte, avrà messo su qualche chilo che non vuol proprio andare via, spenderà ore interminabili di trucco per sembrare una milfettona decente, e arrivata ai quaranta avrà deciso che bisogna fare urgentemente un figlio perché la menopausa è alle porte. Già è difficile trovare un buon maritino a quell'età (proprio lei che è specializzata in coglioni tipo Lupin), metteteci poi la depressione e l'ansia dovute all'essere ricercata dall'Interpol e a dover cambiare nome e residenza almeno una volta l'anno, più la non brillante gestione delle proprie finanze, ce la vedo suicida prima dei sessant'anni accanto a una bottiglia vuota di vodka da supermarket.

A me che mi identificavo con Goemon affettatutto resta un velo di tristezza per gli amici persi e il dolceamaro di tanti bei ricordi delle grandi avventure di quando avevamo salute e tanta voglia di fare e di quando la mia saggezza (""chi dice donna dice danno!"") non veniva ascoltata. Tutte le serie successive di Lupin hanno costruito nuove storie, tutte inventate e puramente scenografiche, hanno alterato il carattere dei personaggi per fare più audience e per adeguarsi ai tempi (Lupin sul dark web coi bitcoin), sbiadendo sempre più l'immagine originale di quell'imbattibile trio.

&gt; Recently, Jonathan Toomim has written a detailed proposal for addressing a significant issue on Bitcoin Cash. That issue has been that ""benevolent"" miners are losing money relative to profit seeking miners.

Most reasonable readers will see this context, and assume that you are accurately summarizing my article. Your use of quotes in the context of summarizing my article will usually be interpreted as a direct quote. 

With or without quotes, this ""benevolent"" word is a problem. My article *did not describe them this way* -- it only mentioned ""steady,"" ""consistent,"" or ""constant"" hashrate, and did not ascribe motivations to these miners.

Please don't misquote other people. Don't mischaracterize their arguments. Be charitable and accurate when restating the position you're arguing against.

A less ambiguous way to indicate its euphemistic nature would be to prepend the word ""supposedly."" A better strategy would be to not use the word ""benevolent"" at all.

fxs2muv,nullc,13,"I don't think that it does for a very specific reason:

Most of the ICO's you see exist for a specific non-obvious purpose.  There fewer than 7000 or so people who bought the initially sold coins from the 72 million coin ethereum premine, and half of that  amount went to under 100 parties.

These ultra massive positions are illiquid: They can't exchange their positions for positions with long term value without crushing the ethereum price, perhaps irrevocably. 

So, they sponsor all these ICOs, many of which are extremely sketchy or outright fraud in order to get additional suckers in and get them locked up for various periods in order to unwind their positions (or otherwise extract value from them) without collapsing the price.

A key point there is that the people propping up these ICOs are losing tremendous amounts of money *on paper* in order to do so, but they get real value out.   

So imagine you own a million ETH.  If you sold quickly on the market you'd collapse the ethereum price.  Instead, you seed and sponsor a bunch of ICOs and irrecoverably spend two hundred thousand of your ethereum on assets you know will almost certainly be worthless... but as a result you drive hype that allows you to exit the other 8 hundred thousand of your premined coins for a much better return than if you'd tried to sell the whole amount directly at once.  

It's analogous to money laundering:  In money laundering you use dirty money to prop up a failing business with fake activity in order to give a legitimate origin to them.  In doing so, you might lose half your money-- because the business costs money to operate--, but the money was worthless to you without the laundering because you couldn't spend it without getting caught so its still a good deal-- if you're laundering money.  The business is a bad deal if you're trying to operate it as a legitimate business.

Imagine you move into some small town find find that there were 47 large car washes operating there and you get your hands on their books and see that they're all generating a HUGE amount of business.  You might think ""Wow! Car washes are a big deal here! I want in!"" -- but then you open your car wash and find that the business is a complete bust.  There wasn't really demand for even two car washes, much less 47... and the 47 front car washes more than handled all the real business.  You went into the car wash business by [imitating their appearance without understanding the real business motivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult), and failed as a result.

So it doesn't matter if Liquid provides an equivalent or even better issuance platform because for the most part there is zero or nearly zero interest in buying these ""issued assets"" except as a result of the largely dishonest hype which was only generated to help make a market to offload eth holdings.

The situation isn't the same for Bitcoin-- Bitcoin was utterly premineless and for the most part didn't end up with the same asset distribution and people are much more substantially in it for the long run.  To the extent that long time Bitcoin holders needed to generate hype to unwind their positions they have historically been able to do it using Bitcoin itself and later by using the altcoin hype (for a long time the only way to buy most altcoins was by going through Bitcoin).

This is also why you've seen all manner of other fringe altcoins with all kinds of asset functionality go totally unused.  The people creating them have fundamentally misunderstood the market demand.

So sure, to the extent that there is a legitimate interest in issuing assets liquid might be a useful replacement for much of it (particularly because these assets themselves are centralized so a federated system to track them isn't a security downgrade)... but I think the level of real interest there is pretty limited -- mostly just 'stable coins' that don't have any speculative value themselves.

Similarly, to the extent that there is market to sell potemkin dreams to suckers who don't require enough hype-spend to operate at a (paper) loss, that market has been largely tapped out by the initial ICO craze.  The most vulnerable marks have already been sucked dry.

Everything else is just a way to generate hype to unwind premine fuelled massive positions which don't exist in Bitcoin land.",2020-07-12 09:59:59

fxuea10,jstolfi,20,"According to that and other articles, some rightfully anonymous miners rented enough hashpower on Nicehash to gain a majority of the BTG hashing power, and on July 1st started mining a secret branch of the blockchain, presumably with the fraudulent reversal of some payment made after that date. 

This ""fix""  was made easier because BTG uses a modified proof-of-work formula that is supposed to be ""ASIC-resistant"", meaning that it cannot be easily accelerated by custom chips. With that, the creators hoped that mining would be limited to ordinary computers and hashing power would remain widely dispersed among thousands of small miners.

Well, that hope does not seem to have been realized...

The ""fixers"" released their secret branch on July 10, which by now had over 1300 blocks.  According to the basic principle of the bitcoin protocol, all BTG users should have immediately and automatically accepted the new branch as ""the"" true blockchain -- and thus any payment cancellations and redirections included in it.

The ""fix"" partly failed, however, because the head developer of BTG (CryproDG, alleged to be @AlejandroRegojo on Twitter) had posted a  release 0.17.2 on July 2, that (unbeknownst to all users, including the ""fixers"") established a new checkpoint for the blockchain. That is, the new release included a new rule:  

    block number 640650 must have the hash 
      ""000000059ec8884fa4fbbdbe46c09cfb4ecba281dfa2351a05084e817c1200ae""

which was a block of the non-secret chain, mined sometime after the ""fixers"" chain branched off.  

Thus, every BTG user who had upgraded to  0.17.2 (or applied a manual configuration patch with the same effect) rejected the ""fixers""' secret branch as invalid, even though it had more work than the ""unfixed"" branch. (Note that the illustration on the linked Coinspice article is wrong.)

Thus BTG users can rest assured, because the coin's Central Executive Officer will surely detect any similar attempted ""fixes"" in the future and will take similar prompt action to thwart them -- by informing everybody of which of multiple ""valid"" blockchains is the ""right"" one.  They can trust him.  If nothing else, because Vitalik Buterin, the CEO of Ethereum (which is itself transitioning from proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake scheme) fully approved his performance in this case. 

The only snag in this incident was that any BTG user who did not upgrade to 0.17.2 and did not know about the manual fix **did** switch to the ""fixers"" branch on July 10.   As they continued to use that branch, they may have experienced confusing responses, possibly including payment reversals and redirections, from those exchanges and users who eventually rejected it.   

However, there is no reason to expect that the losses of BTG users due to this hiccup will compare to those that they suffered in the three previous successful 51% ""fixes"", that netted 388,201 BTG (worth $17.5 million at that time), 1,900 BTG ($19,000), and 5,267 BTG ($53,000), respectively, to the respective ""fixers"".",2020-07-13 02:00:45

You also had issues with bitcoin payment, this is the first time with the new extension on the site so there were a few bugs. Again I could likely help you pinpoint the issues, but not during a live event. I was messing around with the new bitcoin extension to see if its possible to send you another invoice, but I don't think that's an option.

&gt; Stan informs me that there isn’t a way for them to go into my invoice and have me remit payment.. but despite that fact he tells me that he actually re-sold the seeds I ordered and sent them out to another customer.. also since there is no inventory (which there should have been because I placed an order that should have taken those seeds out of their inventory count) I will have to wait until the store opens back up and place another order.. I guess I have to just cross my fingers and hope their website will accept my payment this next time?!? 

&amp;#x200B;

We didn't sell your seeds to another customer. You never successfully made a payment, therefor the inventory was never set aside for your order.

fxvqtai,yeahdave4,12,"After four weekly red candles, it is very rare for BTC to have a 5th red candle.  Granted the red candles are small but (depending on which exchange you look at), 5 weekly red candles in a row hasn't happened for years.  A lot of people were betting that the 5th candle would be green (out of sheer odds).  Now that this 5th candle is indeed a small green candle, it will be easier to continue to have red candles (sounds silly but this is what a lot of people were looking at).

The correlation with the stock market is too strong to apply any independent projections/planning to crypto.  Things could look good (and they do look very good), but the stock market could reverse that at the drop of a hat.  Until there is independent demand and confidence in the crypto space I would suggest caution and patience.  The risk to reward is very poor in trying to catch a $242-$250 move.  This is magnified by the fact that there was little follow through with the ratio breaking above 0.026 and the low volume in general.  I am going to wait for confirmation and momentum.

As always, this applies to people making particular decisions right now and not to blind/automated cold accumulation.

Edit:

As a side note.  It seems Eth is no longer an altcoin in a lot of ways (from a trading/volatility perspective).  The question will be, will the ratio wither when Bitcoin makes a move or has that changed as well?  It will be interesting to watch and will be another sign that the market has begun

**One small but imho very important side note:**

ASICBoost is basically an attack on the SHA256 bitcoin mining algorithm. It allows taking a shortcut via version rolling and was discovered **and patented** by Timo Hanke and RSK designer [Sergio Lerner](https://twitter.com/sdlerner).

This was the big fuck-up that set the stage for all the drama that later unfolded. Exactly as BtcDrak [predicted](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-October/013184.html) in his reply to Sergios bitcoin mailing list [post](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-October/013178.html) October 2016. Unfortunately Sergio seems to have lacked the mental capacity at the time to understand what was explained to him and didn't change course.

Besides Sergio and Timo, Bitmain also holds or held ASICBoost patents in China (which probably infringe on the other ones).

Those patents made it impossible to use overt ASICBoost without risking lawsuits. Covert ASICBoost was also patented, but Bitmain and possibly others could still use it secretly due to the fact that it's next to impossible to detect it's use when implemented correctly.

Nevertheless, when u/nullc (Greg Maxwell) [discovered](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-April/013996.html) that SegWit basically breaks covert ASICBoost, he also found that Bitmain implemented it in it's mining hardware. Bitmain later confirmed the allegations but pretends (to this day) that it was only implemented for shits and giggles and never actually used covertly. (LOL!)  

Only after the patents were acquired by *Little Dragon Technology LLC* and made available for free via the *Blockchain Defensive Patent License* things took a turn for the better. Unfortunately very few companies in the space have pledged their support for the *BDPL* so far with Blockstream being one of the very few positive examples.

Bitcoin Magazine has a good [article](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/there-bitcoin-patent-war-going-initiative-could-end-it) on this.

Thanks to those efforts, others can now use overt ASICBoost and the mining hardware marked stayed competitive. Otherwise it would have become a monopoly for the patent holder with most likely catastrophic consequences.

Just one more example of how bad (software) patents really are, I guess...

**For context:**

Hasan is talking to KimDotCom, the man behind the infamous site MegaUpload, about the hack today on Twitter in which tens of high-profile verified accounts from corporations to celebrities to politicians were tweeting out bitcoin addresses in order to scam $ by claiming to double it upon the money being received. 

KimDotCom is alleging that this was likely done by abusing a backdoor installed by Twitter at the request of the US Government, as no normal 'power user' or staff member in theory would have such powers. And that the Wikileaks files about NSA backdoors in social media sites / big tech products shows that this is reality. 

EDIT: At the same time, some tech journalists are hypothesizing that the hack might have been of a support account which can change authentication settings on any account and thus leave them breachable.

As of now, Verified users are having their tweet ability restrained.

A decentralized distributes ledger is the way to achieve a true fixed supply and resist the temptation to increase supply.  Scarcity leads to value as the theory goes.  ADA improves where BTC failed with the POS system.

Both ETH and Tezos have infinite supply and that is a distinguishing feature of ADA in a POS system.  EOS has a built in 5% inflation to reward block producers.  So ADA is the one staying committed to fixed supply.

Regarding inflation being necessary to a healthy economy, where does that assumption come from? We’ve never had an economy with a true fixed supply of anything to know the effects.
There is also the fact that it will take, what 100 years?, for ADA to reach its fixed supply.

Bitcoin actually being what it is advertised as, a ~~stable~~ store of value or currency, the question of ""What price Exit Bitcoin"" would not even make sense, people would save or use Bitcoin, but they would never exit it outside of necessity like having to pay for a unexpected expense no matter the price at that time.",2020-07-20 18:39:14

Basically, the math equation that governs how bitcoin works is SHA-256, a cryptographic hashing algorithm. It takes whatever data you want to input to it, and turns it into a 256-digit binary number. It's cryptographic, which means that it's very, very hard to find out what data you put into it if you only have the output number. It's reasonably easy to go from data to number, though. 

The data that is used in bitcoin is a block of orders. These are individual transactions on the bitcoin blockchain, as well as a reference to the previous block. Each block also awards some bitcoins to the whoever mines it.

To mine bitcoin, you take a fresh block, add a nonce to it, and hash it. Your goal is to come up with a rare enough hash that the rest of the bitcoin network will accept it. This requires a certain number of leading zeros in your hash, the binary number that you get from your hashing algorithm. If your hash isn't rare enough, you come up with a different nonce and try again. In 2015, you had to try 200 quintillion nonces to mine a block. Things are way harder now. 

So, the math equations are part of the system. The miners solve them to prove that they looked hard enough for the right nonce to fit into the system, and thus deserve your bitcoins.",2020-07-21 11:21:34

The only reason they have any value is because people are willing to trade currency for it. Bitcoin has low transfer costs compared to traditional methods such as western union.

Hello from the future!  I'm your 35 years old self.  Hello!

I write this to you to warn you of several things, including bad choices you make that have major repercussions for the future.

First, you currently have undiagnosed ADD.  I know you think you are just lazy because that's what everyone is telling you, but it's ADD.  Bug your mother to see a psychiatrist.  Get some meds.  Things will go much easier for you if you do, instead of waiting to find out until your 30.  It'll make future bosses happier as well.  Hell, you might not get kicked out of your first high school because you didn't pass any of the classes and couldn't actually be bothered to go!

Second, lose some god damn weight.  Start working out some more.  It's much easier at the age your at then waiting until your older like I did.  I know your mother makes some delicious meals, and you can still have them, just eat... less.

Third, take better care of your god damn teeth.  Trust me.

Fourth, get some speech therapy.  Sooner the better.  I know this is unimaginable to you right now, since you are really ashamed of your stutter.  You don't even want to admit that you have a problem, because that would be admitting there's something *wrong* with you.  While you will get over that in your early twenties, that attitude will make your teenage years hell.  Because you didn't go until you were twenty, you had to deal with all the emotional baggage that came with it.  It made your teenage years very lonely.  Don't make that mistake again.

5th, in a few years, you might meet a girl named Jenny.  She will seem really friendly, and you will just be happy to have a close friend again.  You will even develop a crush on her.  When you do meet her, run away.  Run away as fast as you can as far as you can.  She is Satan incarnate and that friendship will turn slowly more and more emotionally abusive as the years go on.  She will slowly demolish any form of self-confidence you have and convince you that all of your other friends don't really like you, that no one really likes you and they find you annoying, and all you have is her.  She will have you wrapped around her finger as her substitute boyfriend and she will fuck you over again and again.  She will ruin years of your life.

fyvhvxt,Mark_Bear,381,"Beware of a ""cashless society"".

This is serious.

For example, **negative interest rates**.  Suppose you're saving for a car,  a home,  a college education, or just a nice, long vacation trip.  You put your money in the bank.

In the old days, the bank paid you interest to entice you to leave your money with them. They would loan it out and make a profit.  Nowdays, you get zero interest (or nearly zero).

Suppose the bank charged you money to park your cash there.  You might keep adding to your savings, but your balance stays flat, or goes down.  Today, if they did that, you could just hide your cash at home and choose to not pay the bank this ""negative interest"" (they'll call it 'fees' or some euphemism).

**Suppose there's no more cash**.  You ***can't*** take cash out of the bank.  You can't stop them from just taking it from you.  You can't earn money without them knowing about every cent and from whom you got it.  You can't spend a cent without them knowing who you gave it to and (most likely) what you got in return.

Suppose you donated money to a political cause.  The people in power might label that group, conveniently, as a ""terrorist organization,"" after the fact.  They'd check their computers and see that you gave money to ""terrorists.""  Now you're on the ""terrorist"" list and with the click of a mouse they can **block you from being able to receive or to spend any money whatsoever.**

They would certainly ban our ability to convert between Bitcoin and their ""cashless money"".

fyv0ycs,bitusher,52,"Do not day trade , most people day trading end up losing money. 

Here is some general advice.

1)	Do you have high interest debt (5% and higher) and no savings?

If the answer is Yes - Do not invest in any Bitcoin.

2)	Do you have any credit card debt and fiat savings?

If the answer is Yes ,than at minimum pay off all your credit card debt with fiat savings unless you are in debt to such a degree and plan on filing bankruptcy. Do not invest in Bitcoin until you have paid off all high interest debt

3)	Have a lot of low interest credit card debt (below 5%) and no fiat savings?

You should make a budget , cut expenses, and simultaneously start paying off your debt(unless you plan to file chapter 7 bankruptcy) , start saving a fiat emergency fund, and start buying Bitcoin.

4)	Have no debt and no fiat savings?

You should make a budget , cut expenses, start simultaneously saving for 6-12 months worth of living expenses in fiat emergency fund (only stable forms of fiat, obviously not the Argentinian peso or Venezuelan bolivar) and invest in Bitcoin, and seriously consider investing in stocks(preferable an index fund ETF like SPDR) or a IRA.

5) You have a large amount of fiat savings and no debt and want to know if its best to dollar cost average invest or invest it all immediately?

The answer almost always is to make a plan and invest 100% of the fiat (not including your emergency fund) immediately in a diversified portfolio of investments that are non correlated (land, stocks, Bitcoin, businesses with positive cash flow) . It is often impossible to time the market and those that invest earlier will gain the most compound interest. The reason why dollar cost average investment is popular and a fine strategy is merely because most people don't have a large amount of fiat to invest upfront so invest a little each time they are paid.

Here is a useful tool for you - https://dcabtc.com

Thus if you get paid twice a month than what you should do is buy some Bitcoin immediately twice a month and also in addition set buy limit orders on an exchange for 5-10% below spot price. If those orders do not get filled by  the following paycheck than buy your set amount and reset the buy limit orders for 5-10% below spot price from the current market price.
The reason for this is 2 fold:

1)	you can auto pickup savings with BTC volatility on the dips which is psychologically rewarding

2)	If a large amount of people create large amounts of Buy limit support than BTC becomes more stable unit of account and more liquid leading to more investor confidence and making BTC more of a currency(less volatility = better unit of account) and thus increases the likelihood your investment will continue appreciating in value.


The reason having a fiat savings account is so important is it not only will it save you if you lose a job or have an unexpected car expense or medical bill, but that it makes you a more rational investor that is less stressed out by the volatility in your more risky investments like Bitcoin. Bitcoin historically has had at least 2 bear markets lasting a little over 1 year thus you need to be prepared to not be forced to sell at a loss for at least 2 years to give yourself enough of a buffer.",2020-07-22 20:13:01

I posted something crypto related on my story yesterday and I had a guy message me saying he owned some ETH. I asked him if he was excited about staking and DeFi and he had no idea what I was talking about. After showing him all the innovation in DeFi and the upcoming 2.0 upgrade he was blown away.

There will be many people in the next bullrun who will start with bitcoin but also dabble into Ethereum for the extra gains. Once they see that Ethereum actually innovates while bitcoin stays stagnant, I think we will see the tides turn.

The amount of comments I read online talking about Bitcoin in relation to fiat (price, spending methods etc) just shows how people do not fully realise it's potential, and how entrenched in the current Money Fiasco we are as a society. 

If you can hold your own money without your bank using it as leverage to invent more money out of thin air, it's buying power shouldn't decrease with economic growth. Familiarity, fear and lack of understanding are holding us back from moving away from governmental and corporate tyranny and towards true democracy, and if enough of us realise this and participate, we all get rewarded during the changeover. The frustration I feel trying to turn people onto this simple concept is sometimes difficult to bear!

Bitcoin is something non saw coming and even now after more than 10 years they still don't know how to handle it.

By now it's clear what it can do and what it would imply.

Still tptb have no clue how to stop it.

Even in this phase where fiat clearly has to show how it works and what the end will be, Bitcoin isn't attacked on a large scale.

They know it's a black and white situation.

Or just slowly letting it grow, grow untill it will take over.

And than there is this other option.
They could right now decide to just buy in with a large portion of their wealth just to make sure they will still be in the top wealthy.

But that would be the ultimate and final surrender to Bitcoin.

Just give it a thought.
For more than a hundred years fiat gave them ultimate control.
It gave them power to control politicians, placed them above the law. 

And than this absolutely ""simple"" home made Bitcoin pops up with the ability to just neutralize all that power.......

And so fails to be a reflection of anything at all but an arbitrary number pulled from satoshi's butthole.

&gt;Second, centralized financial services are discriminatory and don’t  allow free access to everyone. Bitcoin is universal and free. This means  that for the first time in human history, everyone will be able to  participate in the global economy.

If they pay an existing hodler for some bitcoin, and if they have the right equipment to use it and if anyone accepts it and .... well it's sure as shit not free, if you don't pay the miners you don't get your transaction, and they can decide not to include arbitrary transactions they don't care for and ...

&gt;Bitcoin allows people to have full ownership and control of their  personal and financial information, protecting both their identity and  their wealth.

fyyghxy,Brunswickstreet,99,"I'll try to explain this step by step for all the newcomers and other people who havent traded actively. So what you see here is called an orderbook and is essentially what you see when you trade Bitcoin on exchanges like Binance or derivatives markets like Bitmex. 

The green steps are buy orders, so people that want to buy Bitcoin, the red steps are sell orders, so people that want to sell Bitcoin. The middle between both these orders is the current price. 

So lets say the price is $9.450 if I wanted to sell at $9.455 I'd be on the right of the orderbook pretty close to the middle. If I wanted to sell at $9.600 I would also be on the right but much further up, away from the middle. Now if I want to buy I'm on the left side, the further my buy order is away from the actual price the further I'm away from the middle. Now if two orders meet in the middle, BTC is being traded and a new current price is agreed on. Thats actually how the price of Bitcoin is determined on a global scale, if a seller and a buyer agree on a price.

What happens a lot in crypto is that buy- or sellwalls are set up to create artificial pressure on the price because people looking at the order book see the huge sell-orders and cant imagine all these Bitcoins being bought so the price drops. Most of the time at the exact same moment these walls are being touched, people pull them because they didnt actually want to sell their BTC but just wanted to supress or prop up the price. In this case though, it looked like a legitimate cluster of sell-orders that just got eaten up by buyers and pushed us through $9.500.",2020-07-23 15:44:18

* Wasn’t going to address this and Morgan has been asking her for months, but with all the DMs/comments she wanted to make sure that we all understood that she wasn’t okay staying in an abusive relationship for 10 years. Wants to clarify this. She was called every name in the book, including body shaming :( (I will not repeat any of the horrible names). Wants to share what she dealt with before and after the show and made a list of all the lies she found out about after TI because they’re crazy.
* Met Evan when they were 19, right before he went to USC for a full ride (basketball). Tried to date, didn’t work out, (dating a college athlete is a nightmare). From 2009-2012 they were very on and off and dated other people.
* 2012 his dad died, she would never talk down on that. She says it made a change in him. Talked about how she was supportive of him and his family and very involved… said he did the same thing that he did on TI in Summer 2012. He had a psychotic breakdown and moved to Washington and dated a random Volleyball player he barely knew for 3 months. She said that he has done this before,  it was a pattern… has breakdowns and starts a new life.
* At that point kicked him out completely, but on his birthday her friends encouraged her to reach out, he texted back immediately (she had been ignoring him for months even though he had texted her a lot). She noticed a big change in him… said she went to go hang out with him and he was loving and affectionate and kind. 3 weeks after this they went exclusive. From that point until weeks before TI things were good and they were best friends. Said he had a lying problem but didn’t realize how bad until after TI.
* 2-3 years before filming TI, she turned 26-27 got her shit together, got a FT job running Gap stores in Hawaii and California, was In higher management, got her own apartment. She was expecting him to be an adult, pay equal on the bills ... (Cut the video of here because of her  pup so went a bit off topic when she came back in the next paragraph)
* Says her dad had an analogy about her and Evan and it was the frog in boiling water (when she first met him it was normal water and slowly the water just kept getting hotter, at TI it was boiling and she was like ""WTF am I in?"")
* During College was normal for him not to have a job as he was on a full ride on his basketball scholarship, then his dad happened and wasn’t going to get on his ass then about getting a job. When she was 26-27 was when she needed things to change and told him they both needed to be adults. Thats when the gaslighting and mental and emotional abuse started because he knew she wouldn't put up with bullshit anymore and enable him. Says her confidence was intimidating to Evan.
* Her friends and family said it got to the point where she wasn't herself anymore. Was very careful, her anxiety was out of control, couldn't eat infront of Evan. He would pick fights with people on the street (beating the shit out of people), punch holes in walls, small doors. Spit on her at a Christmas party, recorded it and tried to make it look like it was her fault. Those were just small things in the 2-3 years before TI. He full blown brainwashed her during these years.
* She knew in her heart and gut something was wrong and started researching and reading, but she was so brainwashed by Evan that she convinced herself that her anxiety was out of control, because Evan would constantly tell her that. She would try to leave him and he would sob uncontrollably and threaten to hurt himself. She has a huge heart and is sensitive and he knew that she wouldn't leave him if he did that.
* Feb 2018 (before they went on TI) - they shared an iPad and she opened it and it opened into his Instagram DM's and there were 40-60 messages from women. She found all kinds of shit like he was facetiming his Ex even though he told her she was stalking him. She told him he had 3 days to get out. He had a full blown breakdown, it was really bad, she left work early because she was worried about him. She came home and the ""infamous ultimatum happened"". He told her he'd do anything. She laid it down seriously and told him how it would work. Said he needed to get a FT job and needed to pay 50/50 of the bills. Said the behaviour - if she even thought things were going down he was out instantly on the streets. Mentioned that his mom venmo'd her $400 a month rent. Said she needed a real commitment by her birthday. Said he was a gentleman from that moment on until the moment they parted ways on the first episode of TI.
* After the show it was bad, doesn't remember what happened. People told her how insane it was but what we saw doesn't even do it justice how bad it was. Remembers being in the car and going through McDonalds. She went to a Hotel room by herself and sat up on the bed all night until the sun came up watching Talladega nights on a marathon repeat (11-6). Went to sleep for 45 minutes, did her last interview, went to the airport had a redeye flight with huge suitcase. Get to LAX at 6AM, (says this is hard to talk about) knew she had to save as much money and needed to figure out how to get all her luggage across the airport into an Uber and it was horrible and she just needed to get through it without breaking down.
* She never reached out to him after that, never wanted to speak with him again. When they got back, his brother had been watching the show and Evan had reached out (Happy Birthday, DMing her friends, DMing her, crying in public). His brother said she had to let him come over, she let him sleep on the couch with no pillow no blanket sobbing on the couch all night.

**THE LIES** 

* Kaci had a fully paid off car she loved, when they were moving back she sold that car in order to get them back to LA, under the impression he would ship his over. Months went by, it never came and he made up a story about how he talked to the dealership in Hawaii and would sell it back to the dealership. He stopped making payments on the car the second they moved to LA for months , had been getting repossession letters, lawsuit letters and they couldn't find the car. He told Morgan that Kaci didn't have a license to drive, never owned a car and that she's irresponsible. 
* 10 years she knew Evan he worked for 9 months at a restaurant. The entire time they lived in LA he lived on unemployment and Kaci paid for absolutely everything (except the $400 a month rent from his mom). She worked at GAP (operations manager) and worked at a tanning salon. Would wake up at 2-3AM to work at Gap and then work at 1-2 in the afternoon. Would take a bus from the mall to tanning place (hours on a bus). Would work until 9 at night and get home at 11. Would get home and Evan would do nothing, be high as F and have eaten all the food she paid for. She did this 6 days a week and would cry at work because of how exhausted she was. Told her that he will be strong for her later in life when they have kids. Told the cast that Kaci was the one at home while he was out hustling and being a ""bitcoin baby"".",2020-07-23 09:24:01

fyyud1s,Tricky_Troll,50,"Now that we’ve had a bit of time to collect ourselves after our recent dopamine rush, I’d like to take a look at all of the factors which I see affecting ETH’s price in the coming months. Naturally, I have a bullish bias and I will almost certainly be wrong about some of the following points, but we only really need a few of these possible factors to come to reality to get ETH moving.

I’m really starting to think that we are on the brink of something big. There are so many bullish events on the horizon on the condition that traditional markets don’t shit the bed. The recent breakout has [pushed us up to resistance levels on the ETH/BTC ratio](https://i.imgur.com/HOvOfHJ.jpg) which if we break through, we won’t have seen in over a year. A break above 0.028 would be incredibly bullish. Not only this, but Bitcoin is also looking like it wants to breakout after two months of sideways action. If it does break out, ETH could see some incredibly explosive growth on the top of Bitcoins gains since ETH typically outperforms BTC when BTC is above its 20 week moving average.

Now that the parabolic DeFi token price action is calming down and 2x gains in a week are no longer ubiquitous, it wouldn’t surprise me to see people start moving back into the blue chip cryptos (ETH and BTC) to avoid the impending volatility and pullback in alts. On top of this, we will of course have ETH 2.0 staking hype leading into the final months of this year. I’m beginning to expect that we could see a [2016 or mid-2017 type move](https://i.imgur.com/bIP1LwR.jpg) on the ratio for ETH. To back up this movement, I think it is very likely that the stock market will remain “strong” through ’til election time as Trump will do everything he can to keep markets looking strong (And by that I mean convincing J Pow and the gang over at the Fed to keep up the [brrr](https://brrr.money/)). He has shown many times before (through Twitter of course) that one of the things he cares about most in terms of how the public perceives him is by looking at the performance of the stock market. Therefore, keeping up this facade will be important to him for his re-election prospects.

Going into 2021, following a 2016-eque pump for the ratio, I think a pullback for the ETH/BTC ratio would be likely and could coincide with BTC breaking ATH. Since Bitcoin breaking its all-time high will be mainstream news, Bitcoin would likely lead the charge for a while like in late 2016 as it takes time for newcomers and institutions to understand the wider crypto markets. Eventually, I imagine ETH will have another pump as BTC goes parabolic and people search for returns elsewhere. At this point, the ratio could potentially get back into ATH territory and even flippening territory. However, I personally think that the possibility of hyperinflation in fiat currencies would actually push adoption of Bitcoin more than ETH due to the easily understood and meme-able 21 million hard cap. I see the day ETH flipping BTC as being after ETH 2.0 has rolled out, allowing for trillions of dollars of value to be settled on Ethereum and transacted relatively cheaply. Unfortunately, I doubt that this day will be before the end of this bull cycle. Despite this, I am certain that this day will come eventually.

**In conclusion, I think that the next 6 months are the perfect storm for ETH. To recap:**

1. BTC is looking ready to move and bring the whole crypto market with it.
2. The ETH ratio has broken out of a multi-year long bear trend and has historically shot up very fast. It very well could do this again in the next few months once we break through the last major resistance levels.
3. The alt-season seems to be cooling off and people will start looking to take profits in the blue chip cryptos (BTC and ETH)
4. ETH 2.0 staking hype will be insane. Most coins pulled at least a 2x in advance of staking (See Cardano, EOS and other ETH attempted murderers.)
5. Trump calling for the fed to keep up money printing up until the election to improve his re-election chances.

This is of course highly speculative and I will inevitable get things in this post wrong. However, I think that a good number of these things I laid out will happen and it’s important to consider how they may interact even if only one or two of these factors come into play in the coming months. Also, I urge you to be patient, November is months, not weeks away, so it will take some time for any of these factors to start coming into play, but when they do, it should be spectacular.

For your 401k, just keep it in an index fund or some extremely far off Vanguard target fund (e.g. 2065). Honestly, most 401k's have lackluster options at best. Just do it, you need the tax break and free money match. Even though I say lackluster, index funds are still very solid choices long term.

For your taxable and roth IRA, you may want to look into the Permanent Portfolio or the All Weather Portfolio or Golden Butterfly. Those will keep you in the game while still providing around a 9% CAGR. They will also limit draw downs to 10-15% or so. It was amazing to watch in it action during the March crash. The performance of my portfolio over the last year is ~14%. You really need to do your homework here because it is not a conventional portfolio and may have associated controversy.

An alternative, and one I DON'T follow, is to invest for dividends and tell yourself that you don't care at all about the stock price. Just give me those sweet sweet dividends! Even though I don't do it, it is still a very viable option. If you don't want to learn how to pick dividend stocks, then just pick some popular dividend etf's (e.g. VYM, VIG, DGRO, DGRW, SPHD, SPYD). Equal parts all of those will give you exposure to a thousands of companies, give or take. Back test all the way to the last GFC to ensure you feel safe. This is an option, just make sure you do your homework so you can be a believer long term. Dividends are a lifestyle choice that can border on religion, lol.

I am going to give one last idea. I think of this idea as diversification more than a realistic winner. Take an amount you don't care about, say 1%, and throw it at a weird controversial moonshot. Something silly but something you believe in strongly personally. One example is bitcoin. If it goes to zero, then it was only 1%, no biggie. If it goes to the moon, then perhaps in 20 years you can reap the rewards. It doesn't have to be bitcoin. It could be Chilean lithium mines. I don't know. Just pick something that floats your boat and is weird and off-the-wall.

With interest rates super low, corporate bonds are a bad idea and they don't provide protection anymore anyways. Look into these when the Fed rate gets back to ~10% (it never will get that high in my lifetime). 

Long term treasuries are not the same as corporate bonds. So, don't confuse them. Look up bond convexity and yield curve control. Bond convexity will blow your mind. Basically, if you own TLT now and yield curve control is implemented, then TLT will double in value, very roughly, give or take.

On the other hand if inflation takes off, then gold and stocks will increase in value and TLT will drop in half as interest rates go up. So, long term treasuries can be awesome.",2020-07-23 04:22:26

fyww4bl,bitcoincams,25,"VTHO will probably soon enter in Top 100 cryptocurrencies now when coinmarketcap has updated VTHO details, (currently at 141 place).

Lot of people still didnt do the math to realize which would be the fair VET/VTHO ratio and reasonable VTHO price compared to VET price. Some of them dont even know Vechain has two tokens. Now with Binance listing and by entering in Top 100, VTHO will catch a lot of new eyes and many people will discover the potential of investment in VTHO when they realize that the main purpuse of VET is to generate VTHO. The question is will those one who do the math buy VET and waith 50+ years to generate VTHO or will they use the same amount of money to buy VTHO directly?! With current ratio theres only one reasonable answer.

For a long time, (if you look my previous posts, even when the price of VTHO was at around 10X lower price from current price) i was convinced VTHO will be one of the biggest gainers if not the winner among all altcoins. Im still convinced VTHO is one of the most undervalued coins. Additionaly, it was not premined so in one way its like Bitcoin in early days without team members and ""advisors"" holding full bags of free premined coins to create large sell walls and sell preasure.

VTHO is still unknown token for wider audience so the potential gain is huge, its so expensive now to generate VTHO that i would not even consider to dump hard earned VTHO at any price just to accumulate more VET. Just take an hour or two and do the math before you set the sell price target and remember that that money you have invested in VET will be worth much more how the price of VTHO goes up.

 * Just because you can have state channels, doesn't mean that the core system should stay at 1mb forever. Those are two unrelated things
 * Just because you can and should build layer 2 solutions, doesn't mean that layer 1 should be arbitrarily crippled. In Ethereum, they solved this by allowing miners to vote on ""block size"", and that's been going pretty well, gently adjusting the block gas limit when it makes sense to do so
 * Yes, Andresen knew that Bitcoin wasn't optimal, and that layer 2 is important. I fully agree
 * Yes Garzik argued against raising the limit in **2012** but subsequently and repeatedly argued for it to be raised — later — i.e. when we got, to quote Satoshi, ""closer to needing it""

fz0ep2t,jtoomim,88,"&gt; While there is a lot of discussion around the DAA, no concrete proposal has reached ABC at the time of this writing, which does not leave us with sufficient time to review adequately, simulate and test, and get feedback addressed before the feature freeze on August 15th.

This is rather cheeky and disingenuous. The issue here isn't that there's no concrete proposal. There definitely is. The issue is that it isn't written based on Bitcoin ABC, and hasn't been submitted to Bitcoin ABC as a code diff against their repo. Instead, the concrete proposal is based on BCHN, and they were asked to review the proposal as a diff against the BCHN repo.

Bitcoin ABC is definitely aware of the [existing implementation](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/merge_requests/692/diffs). The fact that they object to it as not a ""concrete proposal \[which\] has reached ABC"" suggests that they do not think it is reasonable for ABC to read or copy code in other BCH full node implementations or other repositories. Instead, all other BCH full node implementations should need to read or copy code from ABC. This is problematic, and it suggests that there is a non-technical problem here.

Edit: a few hours later, and I've copy-pasted the existing implementation over [onto Bitcoin ABC's codebase](https://github.com/jtoomim/bitcoin-abc/commit/83de74761631e509cba3fd58455b9f094e219a8c).",2020-07-24 04:19:31

fz0ctqt,BigBlockIfTrue,52,"There are numerous severe problems with this article:

* This article complains no concrete proposal has been made yet, but the Jonathan Toomim's ASERT proposal is way more concrete than this Grasberg thing, as evidenced by multiple implementations already being in development.
* The relative formulation of ASERT is chosen despite the absolute formulation being superior on all aspects other than the temporary activation logic inconvenience for which Jonathan Toomim already proposed a simpler solution (fixing the block height).
* A simple polynomial formula was replaced with a formula involving giant lookup tables. The giant lookup table makes the code impossible to read and humanly verify.
* The lack of drift correction is suddenly considered unacceptable for ASERT but was never deemed problematic in all previous DAA changes.
* There is no beginning of a description of how the drift correction is supposed to work, let alone any robustness analysis of this mechanism or any assessment of potentially undesired side effects.
* Never in the history of bitcoin was there a drift correction mechanism. Despite the stated purpose to preserve the original emission policy, adding drift correction is itself a redefinition of the emission policy. It even literally contradicts the ""moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour"" from the bitcoin whitepaper (p. 3) - it is no longer moving and the target is now something different.
* Unlike the extensive ASERT proposal by Jonathan Toomim, zero simulation results or other quantitative analyses are presented in this article.",2020-07-24 04:04:53
fz0aj1j,gotamd,48,"The tone of that blog post is so bizarre, especially right after the dev meeting that included both Amaury and Jonathan (just 1 week ago). The article describes Grasberg as being based on ASERT, which is exactly what Toomim proposed doing. The blog indicated that no concrete proposal existed, yet [Toomim's proposal](https://read.cash/@jtoomim/bch-upgrade-proposal-use-asert-as-the-new-daa-1d875696) was concrete and he even published C++ code [here](https://gitlab.com/jtoomim/bitcoin-cash-node/-/commit/fd92035c2e8d16360fb3e314b626bf52f2a2be67#ee35cfc09ad35fa12b8d0a6280a950e4edde3d20_285_299).

Amaury also announced that, ""Bitcoin ABC is therefore moving forward with the Grasberg DAA.""  Where did this even come from?  He was one of the main voices who was calling for everyone to step back to further develop a problem statement even just last week. I don't understand why this is written in a way that completely ignores Jonathan Toomim's prior work and the previous discussions. It tastes like sour grapes to me, honestly.

EDIT: I want to add to this that I wonder if Amaury thinks he's playing some ""4D chess"" here by forcing the hand of all other node implementations. They either get on the ABC train or BCH splits in November. This is a particularly awful way to achieve his goals, and I honestly hope he doesn't succeed and ABC becomes a dead chain (assuming they persist with the attempt to dictate their preferences over cooperation with other developers and the community at large).",2020-07-24 03:47:12

* Evan Told Morgan that her parents are white trash and that he has met them twice. Her parents did so much for Evan, went on vacation together, family dinners, movie nights, countless hangouts. Her parents bought very thoughtful and expensive gifts.  Was very welcomed into the family. One time he couldn't afford food and his dad sent food to his house.
   * Felt her dad could relate to Evan  - being an athlete, being a player when he's younger, having a stressed relationship with his dad. Wanted to be there for him and welcome him into the family.
* Told Morgan and everyone that all of his friends hate her and are glad they aren't together because ""she's crazy"". Didn't want to get into that too much as she has a lot of respect for his friends and developed their own friendships. He was telling them that he was going to propose to Kaci on the show and that she was the one, would get a ring from the network. Everytime that Evan spoke to them they said it was all good.
* When he was downtown LA with morgan on her birthday days after filming TI, he was sobbing in public, texting her (she wasn't answering) and told Morgan and Erica that he was crying because she maxed out their credit card on Louis Vuitton. Was texting her that he thought he took things too far, was having panic attacks, needed to see ghost. They never even had a shared credit card. She says she's never owned anything designer in her life
* Morgan leaves to fly home and Evans little brother convinces Kaci to let him come over. She had her headphones on to drown him out when he was sobbing all night on the couch. Said that production turned them against each other, he is doubting his feelings for morgan, felt he took things too far between them. He was trying to gaslight her, spend two days together... did errands together and hung out. But did nothing like kissing or sleeping together. He encouraged texts and calls, this went on for a week. He dumped her again in a psycho novel text message. Two hours before that he sent heart emojis and ""thinking about you"". She responded with ""ok, do your thang"" type response and he was pissed by her response. She couldn't get him out of her house at this point, he left his dog there and it was aggressive. When he was out she left for the whole day, she expected everything to be gone when she came back but he took nothing, but went through all of her things. He was trying to stay attached.
* Once he knew she was done he moved out on Oct 27. Was constantly trying to stay in her life and make her presence known, was reaching out to her friends, would send her novels blaming her for everything that happened on the island. She would wake up and there would be heart emojis on her insta pics and then would delete it 9 hours later. He was harassing her for months and on NYE 2018 she sent him a novel of truth bombs. She had not heard from him since that as she basically verbally destroyed him.
* Says she doesn't want him to know where he lives because he's aggressive and sick. This is a reason why she is hesitant with Morgan as she has been still talking to him. Says she doesn't judge her for this.
* After her birthday when she let him over he wanted to talk and he wanted to know about her time on the island, asked if she made any connections. Said she was very careful about the response because she didn't want him to know his name, said in the past he'd target guys she was interested in. Told him that she had a real connection with someone but kept the promise and avoided him like the plague because she didn't want to cheat. He went back a bit on the couch, his eyes got big and he was very taken aback. Told him she had never felt that way before and felt like her best self. He told her ""Well I'm sorry to have to tell you this but I saw screenshots of all the single guys talking saying they want nothing to do with you and think you're unattractive."" and ""if you tell anyone about what I told you we're over for good"". She immediately texted the few guys she was close with and the one guy in particular that this was not true, to get him to show her what he saw. He DID target that person and followed him, tweeted him, asked to go to NY.  (She gets upset here and almost cries) Says he was on a mission to fuck that up and kind of did.
* After the show, left her with a negative bank account balance, unpaid bills, no rent $ that he promised her. Was getting calls from lawyers about money he owed. He stole money from his best friend and said he was going to invest in bitcoin, lost it (clearly didn't invest).
* Mentions some of the things Morgan mentioned in her videos around the lies about bitcoin, owning restaurants, graduating school.
* Told people she had an eating disorder and was suicidal and paid for therapy for her for years. She said this was never ever the case and that she does not have an eating disorder, eats like shit and has bad eating habits. Is just very natural thin and has a fast metabolism. When she's stressed she has no appetite which is why she was so thin on the show. Was never suicidal.
* He told people that she never met his dad, even though she met him 4 times. He made it publicly known that another girlfriend of his was there for him during the entire tragedy. Kaci was one of the first people who found out about his dad, she drove to him immediately, her and her dad were putting up flyers, was making sure the family was fed, picked up his dad's ashes with him. She said this period of time is why she let so many things slide with him
* Throughout the show, was writing him letters mainly just to get her thoughts out, gave them to him after TI after he broke down on her couch. When he realized he couldn't control her anymore and she was ignoring him, he threatened to blackmail her with those letters.
* He has made it very clear to everyone that it was HER idea to go on the show and he didn't want to. She says she was the one who was reached out, thought the DM was a scam - wasn't going to tell Evan because he couldn't mentally handle a show like this... need to be true to yourself, not easily manipulated, have your shit together. She told him about it, he was stoked, said they could get money and have a wedding fund. Was going to use the show for fame and followers, it would change their lives, he couldn't wait to be on TV. He wanted to start the casting process ASAP, they were the first couple cast. Every day that month before they would talk, they made very specific rules and the main thing was understanding they knew they'd be manipulated and until they are actually together, not to believe anything you see on the videos because they know the producers would try to fuck with them. She said ""if they fell for someone, lets respect eachother and break up off camera and pursue that relationship"". He laughed and got emotional and made her pinky promise there was no way that would happen. The night before they started filming he had a full blown breakdown and was on the bathroom floor crying. She told him that if he didn't calm down she was going to have to call 911 or let production know what was happening. He was scared she would fall in love and leave him.
* **Why did she beg on the show?** On her overnight date, those 24-48 hours was one of the best times of her life. Woke up before Val, producer asked her what she was going to do, she told him that she thought she was going to break up at the bonfire, producer was stoked for her. She was very confident at that point, next morning she finds out that she isn't having her bonfire that night, that its been moved to the following night, so a day and a half a way. ""It is what it is"". They told her she wasn't allowed to have her notebook at the bonfire even though they said she could have it with her. On the show he immediately turned things around on her and started gaslighting her and got in her head. She was begging because everything was flooding in at the same time, it wasn't that she was losing someone she loved and she had been trying to get out for so long and he would sob and beg her for second changes. She did every time. Was shook after she sent her other guy away (final date), called him one of the best people she met in her entire life, and couldn't believe she did that. Said she blacked out and still has PTSD from it and even has nightmares about it. Is nervous about bonfires still now.
* How he treated her, how the world treated her... she wanted the world to know this isn't normal. Said he 100% went on the show to find a new her, said her and Morgan were very much alike.
* Says she doesn't take the names she calls Evan lightly. She wants to make it clear she's not a doctor nor does she know his full medical history and to take what we will with it.
* Says TI saved her life. Said she felt like a prisoner.
* After the show he wouldn't let her just live her life, wouldn't let her be happy. Bullied her relentlessly on Instagram Lives.
* ON DATING NOW: Said she is 100% the happiest she's ever been in her life. Said it is really hard for her to find someone who can be patient and understand the gravity of the things she's been through and to take their time with her, it's very scary :(. Doesn't even know where to start. Says it affects her family and friends, everyone who loves her is affected by this. Wants her new life and wants to fall in love again, doesn't even want a new chapter, wants a new book.

Wants to end on two notes:

1. If you love yourself do not be with an Evan, don't be with someone who treats you that way because there will be someone out there who will be crazy about you and will love you, fight for you and be your biggest fan.
2. Be Kind. She has learned from this whole experience that there are some very hateful and mean people in this world.",2020-07-24 04:57:28

Dragonchain has demonstrated **twice Reddit’s entire total daily volume (votes, comments, and posts** [**per Reddit 2019 Year in Review**](https://redditblog.com/2019/12/04/reddits-2019-year-in-review/)**)** in a [24-hour demo](https://youtu.be/pSfBid1_US4) on an operational network.  Every single transaction on Dragonchain is decentralized immediately through 5 levels of Dragon Net, and then secured with combined proof on **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, **Ethereum Classic**, and **Binance Chain**, via Interchain. At the time, in January 2020, the entire cost of the demo was approximately $25K on a single system (transaction fees locked at $0.0001/txn). With current fees (lowest fee $0.0000025/txn), this would cost as little as $625.

If you’d like to read the full proposal with formatting go to the [Dragonchain blog](https://dragonchain.com/blog/reddit-ethereum-blockchain-scalability).

## Hello Reddit and Ethereum community!

I’m Joe Roets, Founder &amp; CEO of Dragonchain. When the team and I first heard about The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off we were intrigued. We believe we have the solutions Reddit seeks for its community points system and we have them at scale.

For your consideration, we have submitted our proposal below. The team at Dragonchain and I welcome and look forward to your technical questions, philosophical feedback, and fair criticism, to build a scaling solution for Reddit that will empower its users. Because our architecture is unlike other blockchain platforms out there today, we expect to receive many questions while people try to grasp our project. I will personally answer all questions across two locations. First, I will be live on a special episode of Super Happy Dragon Lucky, Tuesday, July 28th at **6PM EST** where I will answer questions. I will then answer all questions here in this thread on Reddit.

We have seen good discussions so far in the competition. We hope that Reddit’s scaling solution will emerge from The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off and that Reddit will have great success with the implementation.

## Executive summary

Dragonchain is a robust open source hybrid blockchain platform that has proven to withstand the passing of time since our inception in 2014. We have continued to evolve to harness the scalability of private nodes, yet take full advantage of the security of public decentralized networks, like Ethereum. We have a live, operational, and fully functional Interchain network integrating Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and \~700 independent Dragonchain nodes. Every transaction is secured to Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Ethereum Classic. Transactions are immediately usable on chain, and the first decentralization is seen within 20 seconds on Dragon Net. Security increases further to public networks ETH, BTC, and ETC within 10 minutes to 2 hours.

Smart contracts can be written in any executable language, offering full freedom to existing developers. We invite any developer to watch the demo, play with our SDK’s, review open source code, and to help us move forward. Dragonchain specializes in scalable loyalty &amp; rewards solutions and has built a decentralized social network on chain, with very affordable transaction costs. This experience can be combined with the insights Reddit and the Ethereum community have gained in the past couple of months to roll out the solution at a rapid pace.

## Response and PoC

In *The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off* post, Reddit has asked for a series of demonstrations, requirements, and other considerations. In this section, we will attempt to answer all of these requests.

## Live Demo

&gt;A live proof of concept showing hundreds of thousands of transactions

On Jan 7, 2020, Dragonchain hosted a 24-hour live demonstration during which a quarter of a billion (250 million+) transactions executed fully on an operational network. **Every single transaction** on Dragonchain is decentralized immediately through 5 levels of Dragon Net, and then secured with **combined proof** on **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, **Ethereum Classic**, and **Binance Chain**, via Interchain. This means that every single transaction is secured by, and traceable to these networks. An attack on this system would require a simultaneous attack on all of the Interchained networks.

**24 hours in 4 minutes:** [**https://youtu.be/pSfBid1\_US4**](https://youtu.be/pSfBid1_US4)

The demonstration was of a single business system, and any user is able to scale this further, by running multiple systems simultaneously. Our goals for the event were to demonstrate a consistent capacity greater than that of Visa over an extended time period.

Tooling to reproduce our demo is available here:

## Source Code

&gt;Source code (for on &amp; off-chain components as well tooling used for the PoC). The source code does not have to be shared publicly, but if Reddit decides to use a particular solution it will need to be shared with Reddit at some point.

## Scaling

&gt;How it works &amp; scales

## Architectural Scaling

Dragonchain’s architecture attacks the scalability issue from multiple angles. Dragonchain is a hybrid blockchain platform, wherein every transaction is protected on a business node to the requirements of that business or purpose. A business node may be held completely private or may be exposed or replicated to any level of exposure desired.

Every node has its own blockchain and is independently scalable. Dragonchain established *Context Based Verification* as its consensus model. Every transaction is immediately usable on a trust basis, and in time is provable to an increasing level of decentralized consensus. A transaction will have a level of decentralization to independently owned and deployed Dragonchain nodes (\~700 nodes) within seconds, and full decentralization to BTC and ETH within minutes or hours. Level 5 nodes (Interchain nodes) function to secure all transactions to public or otherwise external chains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. These nodes scale the system by aggregating multiple blocks into a single Interchain transaction on a cadence. This timing is configurable based upon average fees for each respective chain.

For detailed information about Dragonchain’s architecture, and *Context Based Verification*, please refer to the [Dragonchain Architecture Document](https://dragonchain.com/Dragonchain-Architecture.pdf).",2020-07-25 05:45:26
fz5ifor,Frednn,93,"Every 10 minutes a new block is mined. The reward for every new block right now is 6.25 BTC ( plus the transaction fees)

To be able to mine 1 BTC every 10 minutes ( 144 BTC / day) , means you should be able to calculate around 22,000,000 Tera hashes per second, or 22,000 peta hashes per second.


That translates to roughly 200,000 antminer S19 units. Each costing at around 2,000 usd. Which is about 400,000,000 usd in mining hardware alone.

Don't forget electricity ! Each unit consumes around 3250 Watts of power just to operate. Running such a huge scale farms needs about 650 MWh of energy !!!


Soooo ... Yeah.

No single person is mining 1 BTC every 10 minutes. Mining Bitcoin is hard. It's deliberately that way to make it a scarce asset. 


People nowadays gather around in virtual groups called "" mining pools "" , and combine their computational power to mine a block. Then they share the reward among pool members based on computational power each member provides.

fz6xuxf,dEBRUYNE_1,49,"Coinbase is basically the largest exchange with proper fiat on-ramps and would therefore be a great addition to the Monero ecosystem. A listing would significantly increase liquidity as well as improve ease of access. Furthermore, it would signal and confirm that Monero is not incongruent with incumbent compliance and regulatory policies.

&gt;Having Monero on coinbase will definitely pump the price

Whether we like it or not, price draws attention and is a decent method to advertise a currency. Furthermore, a larger market cap arguably leads to ecosystem growth, which will ultimately benefit all stakeholders. 

&gt;If you use Coinbase, you can be certain that all your information will be shared with shady companies and governative agencies

I think it is unreasonable to expect that this information ultimately won't be shared. The Common Reporting Standard (CRS) has been in place for several years now and one can reasonably expect for it to also apply to cryptocurrency companies in the foreseeable future. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Reporting_Standard

Using Monero is actually beneficial here, as it limits the amount of information that can be shared. Essentially, the only information shared is information related to the account at the exchange, as Monero protects the user from the exchange following transactions going forward. Brian Armstrong uses a similar line of reasoning in the What Bitcoin Did podcast:

&gt; Peter Mccormack: Are you worried about the data stored by Coinbase if the government were to become more authoritarian?

&gt;Brian Armstrong: We need to make this a technological solution, something where it can't be tracked, where you don't have to trust Coinbase. In some ways that's a more crypto-native solution. 

**Source:** https://twitter.com/sethisimmons/status/1286753615185678338

&gt;I would never suggest a Monero user to join coinbase, not when i'm aware of the fact that i would be endangering this person's privacy with my suggestion.

Signing up for any centralized exchange with mandatory KYC/AML is a privacy trade-off basically insofar as one has to share personal data in order to get account approval. However, centralized exchanges typically have significantly better liquidity and are way easier to use. We essentially need them in order for the ecosystem to be able to grow. Besides, I don't think we can expect for (i) the average Joe to use a decentralized exchange, which typically require technical competence to use and (ii) centralized exchanges being able to operate without mandatory KYC/AML (at least for higher sums) in the current regulatory climate.

&gt;I don't want Monero to be listed on Coinbase

You basically list reasons for why one should not use Coinbase, not why it would be a net negative for Monero the cryptocurrency. I've said this before, not trying to get as many listings as possible for Monero would basically be shooting ourselves in the foot.",2020-07-25 21:56:11
fz5rjct,Deathspiral222,46,"I'm going to give you exactly one option each time because I assume you want something you can actually do, rather than micromanaging everything. It's all pretty simple:

0. Get any free programs from your job that you can use but forgot to sign up for. 
1. Pay your essential bills (and cut as much crap as you can).
2. If you have money left over, save the money in cash until you have at least a month's expenses (eventually you want six months or so in cash, but just focus on this bit for now).
3. Once you have the one month saved, contribute to your 401K (if you have one) up to the maximum for the match. This money comes out before taxes and it's a fantastic way to save.
4. Pay off your debt above 5% interest.
5. Pay into your 401K until you max it out for the year ($19,500 a year).
6. If you still have money, put up to $6000 into an IRA each year (for both you and your spouse if you have one).
7. If you have kids and want to save for college, set up a 529 plan for each of them, making sure it's one that is good for whatever state you live in. The money will grow tax free if spent on education. Stick whatever you want in here.
8. If you still have money left over, put it in a taxable account with Vanguard.

As for what to invest in: for retirement, you want a (very) low cost ""target date retirement fund"". Basically you decide you are going to retire in, say, 25 years, so you buy the ""2045 Target Date Fund"".

There are two main reasons things may go badly for you: you pay too much in fees, or you get shitty advice and invest in stuff that isn't suitable for you.

You don't need a ""money guy"". You don't need to invest in bitcoin. You don't need a RobinHood options account. Those are all ways to lose money. Just be boring and get boring, average returns. Your main risk right now is yourself - don't chase quick riches with your retirement savings, you are not smart enough to do that (and neither am I). If you want to speculate, do it with a tiny amount of money you can afford to lose.

Two other quick things:

1. At some point you need to figure out insurance, especially when you finally get a bunch of money.
2. Don't invest money you need to use quickly (like to buy a house).",2020-07-25 11:45:05

However, it's much less of a problem for our code than for Amaury's, because we're not converting from chainwork to nextwork and then to target again.

All we do with the target is we [shift it *n* bits to the left or right](https://github.com/jtoomim/bitcoin-abc/commit/83de74761631e509cba3fd58455b9f094e219a8c#diff-867d47d4c9e4c736374a97c3ac684680R143) (to effectively multiply it by 2^(n), where n is an integer), then [check it for over/underflow](https://github.com/jtoomim/bitcoin-abc/commit/83de74761631e509cba3fd58455b9f094e219a8c#diff-867d47d4c9e4c736374a97c3ac684680R153), and finally [multiply it by our approximated 2^(x-n) residual](https://github.com/jtoomim/bitcoin-abc/commit/83de74761631e509cba3fd58455b9f094e219a8c#diff-867d47d4c9e4c736374a97c3ac684680R168). Doing all of that calculation directly on the nBits values would probably be a little more work overall, since we'd have to check for overflow on the exponents as well as carrying on the mantissa, and of course we'd need to separate the two before we did anything. Gaining precision over the current stupid rounding scheme does sound attractive, though. There's a substantial loss in our approximation's precision when we get into the region where nBits only gives us 15 bits of precision (e.g. 0x1c008000 gives a mantissa of 0x8000).",2020-07-25 03:35:29

fza6oo7,MashedPotatoh,51,"Relationships can be tough with parents.  Growing up,  I felt disconnected from my own parents.  They were old school and focused more on providing a roof than mentoring,  so I often felt like I learned a lot on my own.  After my time in the military,  I became a single father and that was when my parents really stepped in.  It strengthened the relationship I have with both of them now.  My dad and I often talk about Tesla and Bitcoin,  these are things that really interest us.  My mom and I go thrift shopping and I even helped her get her own ebay store going,  to help occupy her during retirement and bring in some extra money.  I'd consider myself the black sheep of the family since I'm always the one that struggles to find my place,  but they have both been super supportive and it's helped me move on from the childhood I didn't really understand.  

I know it's tough to open up and break down these barriers with parents,  but I hope you're given the opportunity to do so.  

Sending lots of love  &lt;3

Here's the email I wrote to my daughter,  inspired by this thread: 

Hey Emma!  I couldn't sleep as usual and thought i'd use this time to send you a quick message. I was browsing reddit and came across a post which inspired me to send you a quick message. I want you to know how proud I am of you.  I know I say it often,  but you have been the best child and you make me happy to be a father.  Today,  the way you took Rose under your wing and kept her company,  it showed a lot of compassion and patience from you, and I believe things like that make you a better person.  I am glad we were given the opportunity to take a little vacation,  I'm grateful that Thomas and Ellie were cool with bringing us along on their mini vacation.  

Looking forward to what this new day will bring and hopefully it's filled with more time in the pool,  floating in the lazy river and maybe we can sneak into the arcade.  Lol. Tonight we are making lasagna and i'll need your help to make sure it's the best &lt;3


I love you!

fza7od2,chuck_portis,49,"Remember the events that led to the creation of Bitcoin.  It was in the wake of the 2008 Financial Crisis, during which:

* Governments bailed out failing big corporations with freshly printed USD
* Interest Rates were pushed to record lows to discourage saving
* The fiscal system narrowly avoided a complete collapse

Here we are more than a decade later:

* Governments are bailing out big corporations with freshly printed USD (trillions this time!)
* Interest rates have been pushed to their absolute limit @ 0%
* The fiscal system narrowly avoided a collapse in March

The problems today are much worse than in 2008.  We have propped up zombie companies, printed trillions of dollars (at an unprecedented pace), all in an attempt to keep rich pockets full.  So far, the printing has concentrated itself in equities.  Stocks are trading at record highs, despite the poor economic outlook and deterioration of fundamentals.

Inflation rates are masked by improvements in technological production.  It hides itself in assets like stocks &amp; real estate.  While the rich see their portfolios inflate, the poor who are paid and hold USD see their purchasing power diluted.  The poor &amp; now even the middle class cannot dream of purchasing a house in a desirable area.  

Inflationary currencies benefit the holders of assets (the rich).  Deflationary currencies like Bitcoin distribute wealth more evenly.  Wages are no longer diluted through dubious money printing.  Those in power would love you to believe that inflation is only measured through the price of gas and a bushel of corn.  

This is Bitcoin's chance to rise up and gain notoriety as a digitally scarce asset.  As we watch the USD begin its descent to new lows, we will realize that government policies overwhelmingly favor the rich, and people will begin to embrace new ideas &amp; technology which challenge the historical status quo on money.  

As the USD enters its freefall, the perceived risk of holding BTC will evaporate.  Instead, the risk of holding USD will quickly become apparent.  BTC will solidify itself as a safe haven.  It will be firmly seated beside Gold as a defensive asset, impervious to fiscal policy designed for &amp; by the rich.",2020-07-26 16:57:44

fz84a2o,Tiaan,22,"I don't recommend Coinbase or Coinbase Pro and here's why:

When buying crypto, the main thing people want is to have access to the crypto instantly and have low fees. Unfortunately, the platforms that let you buy crypto instantly typically have higher fees. For example: coinbase and cash app are nearly 2% fee for instant buys, Swan bitcoin is 1-1.79% which is still high.

The alternative is to deposit money and wait for it to clear before buying the crypto. This can take a week or longer which is frustrating when you want to lock in a buy at the current price. To use coinbase pro, you must wait for your deposit to clear beforehand (5+ days) or wire in money ($20+ fee from most banks), and then you still must pay a 0.5% fee when trading! It's a huge ripoff.

What I suggest is to use Gemini ActiveTrader. To access this platform, you must make a Gemini account and request access to the ActiveTrader platform, which they usually grant within a day or so. This platform is like Coinbase Pro to Coinbase. The difference is that Gemini ActiveTrader gives you access to your deposited funds instantly to buy crypto with a low 0.25% trading fee. You just cannot transfer the funds out of the platform before the money clears, but at least you can lock in a buy at the current price at a fee that is 50% of coinbase pro's.",2020-07-26 04:36:00

This is still fragile.  BTC needs to clear 10250 to cement this.  By then Eth will be at the 380-400 target.  Above BTC 10500 will likely be when the hysteria starts to mount, by then ETH 500 will be close.

Last time we went from where we are now to 1400 in about 7 weeks.  If we did the same pace again then that's basically the first week or two of September.  We have more global headwinds now but Eth is going to catch the eye of a lot of dopamine addicted wallstreeters and the robinhood crowd/retail.  Institutional onramps and custody is more established.  ETH has more regulatory clarity.  Not to mention Eth2 deploying.  We got to 1400 playing second fiddle to bitcoin.

fzez31d,just_say_n,37,"I’ve been reading John Mauldine’s letters for years.  He’s a talented and interesting writer who distills complex issues from many credible sources.  That said, he’s never been good at predicting anything—and has been saying that the market is overvalued for as long as I’ve been reading his letters.

This letter was no different—he even goes on to say that he thinks it’s a bad time to buy stocks “for the long term” and that you can expect a much more attractive “entry price” in the near future. This is not new. A few years ago he was advocating being in cash as an “option” to buy equities at lower prices.

Who knows if this time he’ll be right—but you’d have not been a winner banking on his timing in the past.  

That said, I fully agree that we have inflation in equities, but also housing/real estate and other assets (gold, after all, hit a new high and Bitcoin is back above $10K).

That doesn’t mean much, however.  Inflation is, if anything, a way of saying that your money is worth less now than it was yesterday.  

Ok, so?  Does that mean that, because we have inflation, we are also “overvalued” and, more to John’s point, that prices will “deflate”?

Of course not.  So yes, I’ll concede there’s been “inflation” of various assets, including stocks, but that doesn’t mean much besides that it now takes more dollars to buy the same quantity and value of stocks than it did yesterday.",2020-07-28 01:04:17

fzfcdgq,bergs007,30,"The topic of whether to invest in VTHO or VET has come up quite often in these Daily Threads, and I always argue in favor of VET.   However, I've never had a top-level post where I can organize all of my thoughts since I have always been in the position of responding to someone else's argument.  Therefore, here is a summary of why I think VET is the better investment vehicle.

First, let's start with a discussion of what it takes to run a crypto network.   A blockchain network isn't free to run; and in fact, a large part of the reason that it works is *because* it costs money to write transactions.  The people that run the network need to be incentivized to process transactions or else they would drop out of the network.  That is why Bitcoin pays miners to process transactions on the network.  The Bitcoin network pays its miners in Bitcoin, which is the main coin on the network that represents value.

&amp;#x200B;

In the footsteps of Bitcoin, Ethereum (the first smart contract platform) also decided to use a one-coin model for their platform.  This means that the same coin (named ETH) that provides payment to the transaction processors is also the same coin that investors use to invest in the network.

&amp;#x200B;

As the network gains participants and services, the utility-based value of the network grows as well.  As the utility-based value of the network grows, it gains attention and more people want their share of this utility-based value.  They purchase ETH in the hopes that the network will be more valuable in the future. These people are termed speculators because they are speculating on the future utility of the network.

In this manner, the utility-based value and the speculation-based value combine with the help of the market to set the trading price of the ETH coin.  As the value of the network rises, the price of ETH rises; and as the price of ETH rises, so does the cost to perform a transaction on the network.  As such, there is *strong* correlation between the value of the network and the cost of performing a transaction on the network.  Since price discovery is often volatile, this means that the transaction costs are also volatile, due to their *strong* correlation.

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's talk about where the value from a blockchain platform originates.  Let's say that a company receives 20 cents of value (either from supply chain management cost savings or customer trust or any other measures of value) out of being able to track their mushrooms on the blockchain.  This means that they will be willing to pay up to 20 cents in order to do so, but anything over that means they are losing money.  Hence, it behooves the blockchain platform to keep the total transaction costs for that product under 20 cents, or else they stand to lose this business as a customer.

With a single token system, this means that the more money investors put into the token, the more these mushrooms will cost in order to track.  The unfortunate effect of the single token system is that the more popular a platform becomes, the more expensive it is to transact on the system.  Wouldn't it be nice to have a blockchain platform where this isn't the case?  Wouldn't be nice if there was *zero* correlation between the value of a network and the cost of performing a transaction on that network?  Wouldn't it be nice if the value of the network could fluctuate wildly and the cost of performing a transaction was kept extremely stable?

&amp;#x200B;

VeChain understood this issue and they are attempting to solve it.  VeChain, in their two-token system, decided to split the gas token (VTHO) used to pay transaction processors apart from the main network token (VET).  The gas token (VTHO) is designed to represent the utility-based value that enterprises will receive from performing a transaction, while the speculative token (VET) is free to accumulate money from investors (aka speculators).  The system is designed to divorce the two, so that transaction costs are kept stable regardless of the current valuation of the network.

One way to think of this is to treat VTHO like a commodity and VET like a stock.  If you imagine a commodity like soybeans, they get their value from being able to provide energy.  If a kilogram of soybeans can, for instance, feed 10 people for 10 days, then a company can set their price for a kilogram of soybeans based on how much 10 people are willing to pay to stay alive for 10 days.  Likewise, if a 'kilogram' of VTHO can track 10 suppliers' product lines of mushrooms for 10 days, then the price for a 'kilogram' of VTHO should be in the same ballpark as the value that those 10 companies receive for being able to track mushrooms for 10 days.  There is some room to speculate on this value, but the companies themselves know how much value they get out of tracking their mushrooms.  This means that if the price of tracking the mushrooms gets too high, then customers will no longer utilize the service.

On the other side of things, you can think of VET like a stock.  It represents ownership in the VeChain platform.  If you think that the VeChain platform is going to do well in the future, then you should invest in VET because it gives you the rights to a share of the wealth that the platform represents.  You can speculate all sorts of reasons why VET will accumulate value in the future.  You can speculate that the foundation will raise the generation rate of VTHO, which will increase the dividend that each VET gets.  You can speculate that companies will have to purchase VET in order to generate their own VTHO, and that demand will raise the price of VET.  You can speculate that consumers will come to trust the VeChain platform and give more business to companies that utilize it.  The VET token is designed to attract all of this speculative investment.

If you assess the two tokens in this manner, then you must come to the conclusion that the VeChain Foundation will want the VTHO token's price to represent its utility-based value as closely as possible, while carrying as little speculative-based value as possible.  Contrariwise, the VET token's value should absorb as much of the speculative value of the network as possible.  This isn't to say that VTHO will not have any speculative value whatsoever.  After all, soybeans do have a futures market, so if VTHO is listed in the market place, then it will attract speculators.  However, I believe that since VTHO is designed to act like a commodity and VET is designed to act like a stock, VET will attract the lion's share of the speculative investment.  In the context of this analogy, I'd much rather invest in the soybean company than in the soybeans themselves.

So, in summary, I feel like the appreciation in value of the network will flow into VET and not into VTHO; and that is why investing in VET is the more logical choice.

I'm more than open to discuss this, so if you see any holes in my argument, please let me know.",2020-07-28 02:50:11

fzityk9,Kesuke,95,"There's a few distinct issues here;

1. The search
2. The damage to the door
3. The confiscation of the Bitcoin mining setup
4. Damage to one of the mining machines

**The search itself**: I think you appreciate it was entirely justified. They had solid evidence to suggest there maybe a drug cultivation operation occuring and they conducted a raid on that basis.

**The damage to the door**: This is more complex. Police forces DO sometimes make payments in compensation for damage that occurs entering a property. HOWEVER... if the search was lawful (which we've established above is almost certainly the case) then you are unlikely to get much further without going via a solicitor which will probably rack up more costs than the door itself.

**The mining setup**: This is where I think you may have a stronger argument. You'll need to talk to your son and figure out how much this is likely to cost you in ""lost income"". If we are talking big sums of money because he has somehow found a way to make mining profitable (vs the electricity and equiptment costs).

The argument here would rest on the basis that the confiscation of the machines was unlawful (and by extension so also was the damage sustained to the one machine)... everyone has computers in their house, it is 2020... so unless they specifically had reason to believe there was child pornography this seems like they've acted excessively on the basis of the evidence that prompted the search? The police do have broad powers to seize things they believe may be involved in crime though and this would be at the very crux of the legal argument.

You would need to make a claim that they have therefore acted negligently by confiscating the machines (in excess of the warrant) and in the process of that negligence you have suffered damages (both material in the damaged machine and in terms of lost income). I have no idea if any of this would stand up to close scrutiny but one thing I can say is you'll never get them to admit that the confiscation was negligent... you'll absolutely have to go via an IPCC complaint and you'll probably need a solicitor. The very fact that they have done this is probably a reflection of the fact they were left red-faced, as they busted into your house expecting to uncover a major drug ring - only to realize it was a perfectly legal suburban household with a good reason for a hot loft.

As a general piece of advice; the police search houses every day... this is their bread and butter. Whilst there is a lot to be said about their understanding of the law, they do generally act within it because if they're doing this every day then sooner rather than later they are going to get pulled up if they operate outside their remit. As a result, taking the police to court over negligence claims can be very difficult.

fzl8scs,almkglor,18,"This is not a security loss, but it is a potential privacy loss.  If you spend it with other addresses, then that links that address with your other addresses, allowing chain analysis to get more accurate data on wallets.

The proper response is to spend the 0.0001 coin on a charity.  Pirate Bay, Wikipedia, WikiLeaks, Free Software Foundation, etc.  This prevents you from accidentally combining the coin with other coins you control and thus preventing anyone from exploiting this address attack to determine the other addresses of your wallet

(Knowing your addresses does not let anyone steal from you, but you probably do not want anyone from knowing how much money you are HODLing: how rich you are is your business, not anyone else's)

Unfortunately, most hardware wallet web interface (which is what your screenshot looks like) do not have coin control.  Sending out a 0.0001 coin might very well select a *different* coin.  So don't do that using your hardware wallet web interface (you should really avoid the hardware wallet web interface, since it leaks your entire HODLings to the hardware wallet manufacturer).

Fortunately, Electrum **does** have coin control, and recent Electrum versions support most of the popular hardware wallets (to my knowledge it supports Ledger, Trezor, and KeepKey; I have actually used Electrum with Trezor).

In Electrum there is a ""Coins"" tab (if it doesn't appear, look for the ""View"" menu at the top and select ""Show Coins"").  Once Electrum syncs you should be able to identify this 0.0001 coin.  Select the coin (and ***only*** that coin), right-click, and select ""Spend"", then send the max amount to your favorite BTC-accepting charity (Electrum will auto-deduct its fee estimate from the coin).

(You should probably use Electrum in general since it has a good mix of features, though note you are still sending all your addresses to Electrum servers.

Do I have proof? Of course not, but it's hard to see how it can't if the aforementioned conditions exist (which currently it looks like they will exist sooner than later). Also if Bitcoin can hit 20k, a global computer that will help revolutionize how we store and exchange value can surely reach half that price, if not, nefarious players are suppressing it or some black swan event ushered in its demise.

A probable scenario I see happening is if/when the next bull run commences, many people, especially new retail investors, will start to cling to the narrative that Ξ has followed a similar trajectory as Bitcoin, thus they'll assume it's going to around 20k. This will become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

This is not because I think this is a game changing feature, but because I think it’s got the power to make the ETH meme game better than BTC’s. Each dollar moved from BTC proves that someone, somewhere, values that dollar being in the ETH ecosystem more than the BTC ecosystem. Anybody can understand that.

fzkfhug,Bitcoin1776,17,"I know it's unpopular opinion on the sub, but I have the goal of getting as much as I can, sensibly.

So *frankly* I don't hodl. I do trade some, make business investments, etc. I think I spent like $10,000 on random mailers and billboard type ads in my city - but these are crazy fucking mailers, not *btc is cool* mailers, but like 'the end is nigh, get Bitcoin' type mailers, haha.

I've invested in some startups, made a shit load Bitcoin off that. I hope to be doing my own (true) startups soon (book, edu business, etc) and to make more Bitcoin off that. Everything I do costs Bitcoin.

My currency is Bitcoin. I pay Venezuelans in Bitcoin for cheap high quality work. I measure my wealth in Bitcoin, and feel bad when I don't have enough, more. I'm WELL OVER 100% invested into Bitcoin, like 'mortgage your house to buy Bitcoin' type invested.

But I did regret not having more money on Robinhood to play 'guess the stocks' during the pandemic. And I got burned during the 50% one-day crash, cause I had a (very weak) margin position that said Bitcoin wouldn't drop 70% - and it went from $13,000 to $3,300 - when Oil went from $70 to neg $10.

But I got more, and now I'm back at my original stack, from like 2 years ago.

I hope to never 'hodl' Bitcoin, I just want the Bitcoins. Like, lots of them.

It's a fucking insane game we're playing. If you got a huge opportunity (like investing $15k to go to Lambda School for 1 year to make $100k for multiple years thereafter), do it. In today's world, you can start a business with small money, and get huge residuals. I know a lady with a writing service making $150k per year, after just 3 years, doing no work (outsourcing it all) - with like $15k initial investment.

---

If you are a Bitcoin'er, earning $100,000 per year, buying $50,000 more Bitcoin per year... or using other techniques to gain Bitcoin, that is good - always, always get more Bitcoin.

Bitcoin might annualize at 100% per year returns or 20%, but there are peaks and troughs. I'm no day trader, but I will sell a few percents, and place buy orders here and there - but multi year trades are a good move, IMO (loading up now, reducing later, etc).

---

The Bitcoin inflation rate is approaching the magic number. If you call all Bitcoin'ers 'investors', they have to cumulative earn 2% returns *more than* Bitcoin, to purchase all the new Bitcoins. Granted, that's hard in times like these, where Bitcoin is skyrocketing, but like...

Well. I won't go through the math, but I'll just say we are nearing *perma bull* territory.

Set a goal of increasing your BTC holdings by 10% this year, and you will have purchased *your share* of Bitcoin inflation for the next 4 years...

That's what I mean. It's getting easy to perma - self perpetuate. And that to me is a good hodl'r - one who buys more Bitcoin than the year before. One who makes quick investments to get more Bitcoin. One who labors wisely to get Bitcoin. One who eats up all the Bitcoin.

[This business](http://sporeworks.com/) accepts Bitcoin (and other crypto). They never sell their coinage, ever. I did that. Many coins removed from circulation.

Gobble gobble gobble the Bitcoins. It's not a game of bragging rights, it's a game of eat 'em up, and beat 'em up. We got to get all the Bitcoins. 1.3 Mil coins in the next 4 years. Be the hungry hippo my friend, we got lots of work to do. Stay busy, get coin.

fzj1bpu,biggie_dd,16,"&gt;If I were to idly speculate they may have believed some involvement in something illicit due to bitcoin often being linked to the drug trade. So they've gone there for drugs, and found something often connected to drugs, so have seized them until they bottom it out. That's speculation though. 

Cash is often linked to drug trades as well. If they had £200 out on the counter (say, because they were expecting a repairman to fix the washing machine, or something similar, and completely legit), is that up for grabs for the police too? Or a few bags of potting soil and plant nutrient solution, which OP bought to re-pot their flowers?  Or if they have one of those shelf-sized hydroponics kits, which is obviously too small to grow cannabis, but has a grow light in it? 

The whole reasoning is wrong here. ""Oh, we found no signs of any drug related operations, except for a completely legal way of generating a pretty much everyday used form of money, because on a long stretch, it could be used for buying drugs, so we confiscated all"". With that sentiment, why not also take all valuable items from the home, since those could also be sold for drugs?

I understand why there is no short description for it, it is very convoluted and the papesr is vague and pretty hard to read and understand in a meaningful way. But from one I got from it, it is completely centralized and Ethereum (or other blockchains) only act as a way of doing ""check-ins"" which is really just a hash of their chain data and cannot be used without DragonChain at all. Just the receipt. The structure of the ""chain"" itself is also very questionable and is made up of 4/5 layers (they have a graphic outlining this but it seems like the lines are pointing in the wrong direction showing data flowing from L4 -&gt; L1, but everything else indicates the other way around is true):

1. Nodes run by individuals (or groups) to serve a single need, this is where the smart contracts run. The contract receives a header (meta data), signature, and payload. The payload is used to run the contract and is striped before the block is generated. These transactions are received and approved or denied based on the payload and the smart contracts.
2. This layer receives blocks of transactions (valid and invalid) from L1 and verifies that them (signature and what not) and creates a new ""block"" and signs it with a hash of the previous to create a trusted blockchain between nodes.
3. This layer gets the ""blocks"" from multiple (all?) L2's and verifies that it has received the  blocks from enough L2 nodes, ""business units"", and  ""key authorities"" (seems like these keys would be verified against L2 nodes so seems redundant). Not much is given here so it is really hard to know what the difference between these three ""verifications"" are and how they aren't the same. At the end of all of this another blockchain is formed here by signing with a hash of the previous block. It seems like this and L2 could easily be combined, but I guess this is used instead of creating a consensus model on L2?
4. Called the notary, basically third parties take the data from L3 and sign it themselves to verify it exists and they received it.
5. The public checkpoint. This is where ETH comes in (or other chains). Basically a hash of of their private blockchains are kept on public chain. They also say it could be used to currency because they suggest using addresses similar to Bitcoin, but this is not explained and I doubt it is built into the codebase. Also, what is stopping somebody from moving ETH/BTC from an address that matches one on the DragonChain? Obviously nothing. So this leads me to believe that you would have to have your own BTC/ETH node and build something to monitor this.

So overall, it seems like a basic, but convoluted blockchain that gives you some bare bones infrastructure that *could* do a lot with, but you have to build everything yourself that it could do and build it especially for DragonChain. The fact that it is so convoluted would make it hard to work with and having 3 different types of nodes also seems less manageable.

I looked at the code a little but don't have time to do a deep dive but from their Github it seems inactive so I'm assuming the chain is underdeveloped. Also, it is built in Python, so slow.

Immature technology and the use of Ethereum is essentially moot because it is so inconsequential and non-reliant. Also, WHY DO THEY SELL COINS?

fznvsa1,TheGreatMuffin,9,"It's a bitcoin full node. A bitcoin wallet needs a full node in order to know which transactions happened on the network. If you don't use your own node, you (your wallet) are using someone else's node, with all the implications for your privacy and trust assumptions.  

A full node is a software that verifies your bitcoin transactions for you (implicitly it also verifies the overall supply of bitcoin, protects you from fraud from third parties, from ""fake"" bitcoin etc) and gives you a higher level of privacy (you don't leak sensitive information to your wallet's nodes, f.ex).  

Here's a great explainer by P. Wuille (although it doesn't even mention the privacy benefits):  

&gt; One of Bitcoin's strengths - the most important in my opinion even - is the low degree of trust you need in others.   
&gt;  
&gt;    
&gt; If you use a full node for your incoming transactions, you know that there was no cheating anytime in the history of your coins:  
&gt;  
&gt; * Nobody ever created money out of nothing (except for mimers, and only according to a well-defined schedule).  
&gt; 
&gt; * Nobody ever spent coins without holder their private key.  
&gt; 
&gt; * Nobody spent the same coins twice (but see further).  
&gt; 
&gt; * Nobody violated any of the other tricky rules that are needed to keep the system in check (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, ...).  
&gt; 
&gt; ... with one exception: because there is a need to pick a winner in presence of multiple competing valid versions of the ledger, (a majority of) miners have the authority to pick the version of the block chain that wins. This means their power is limited to choosing the order in which otherwise valid transactions occur, up to and including the right to delay them indefinitely. But they cannot make invalid transaction look valid to a full node.  
&gt;  
&gt; If you are not running a full node, the amount of trust you're placing in others increases.  
&gt; 
&gt; SPV nodes (such as some mobile clients, and Multibit) place a blind trust in the majority of miners, without checking validity of the blockchain they produce. It still requires a majority of miners to mislead an SPV node, but they can make it believe anything (including ""You received 10000000 BTC!""). The reason why this does not happen is because full nodes would not accept such blocks, and assuming a large portion of the ecosystem does rely on full nodes, miners who do this would not see their blocks accepted by the larger economy, resulting in them wasting money.  
&gt;  
&gt; Centralized services (most webwallets) make the user trust whatever the site says. They can claim anything.
&gt;  
&gt; So I hope you now see the importance of full nodes in this model. If you run a full node somewhere on the network, and nobody looks at the transactions it validates, it is indeed contributing to the network, but it is not helping with the reduction of trust.  
&gt;  
&gt; Look at it another way: if only a few large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem were running full nodes, it only requires a malicious intent, or an attack/threat against them, to change the system's rules, as nobody else is validating.  
&gt;  
&gt; Doing transactions in the Bitcoin ecosystem helps the Bitcoin currency. Running a full node helps the network. Using a full node helps you and the ecosystem reduce the need for trust.

If Bitcoin ABC has difficulty in getting resources to do improvements for Bitcoin Cash, I am fairly confident that we can ask Bitcoin Cash Node to do all (or maybe most of) the work to make Bitcoin ABC's life easier, so that Bitcoin ABC can backport the codes from BCHN rather than Bitcoin Core (especially so because the Bitcoin ABC software is closer to BCHN than Bitcoin Core's software).

fzo4e1v,hodlDRGN,8,"# LEVEL 5 - SECURITY INTERCHAIN BLOCKCHAIN

A Level 5 node will provide a bridge to one or more public blockchains and allow clients to interact with them (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, etc.).

An important feature that this would provide is that of checkpointing, or placing a hash of an artifact for “proof of existence” on a public blockchain. For checkpointing operations, the Level 5 node will accept a transaction, a block verification of any level, an arbitrary string, or an arbitrary hash. The argument will be hashed and this hash added to a transaction placed on the public blockchain(s). The existence of this hash can be used to prove that the artifact was in existence and at a certain state using public blockchain data. An organization may use this proof to measure and mitigate risk based upon the estimate or calculation of hash power expanded since that time (in the case of a proof of work blockchain). For example, a $2 Million transaction may be passed to a Level 5 node to be placed as soon as possible on the Bitcoin blockchain, and at some point in time later, a party may use that information as a source to measure the amount of hashpower that has been expanded since that time, calculate the probability that an attacker could successfully counterfeit that Bitcoin block given a particular percentage of global hashpower, and extrapolate or estimate the cost to expend that hashpower (as well as the sacrifice of hardware and/or currency due to network collapse). If this process results in a risk evaluation that is satisfactory to the business, the transaction can be trusted and accepted.

Another important aspect of the public bridge functionality is the ability to track assets between the private and public side. That is, given an internal currency implemented to use Bitcoin addresses (see currency section elsewhere in this document), a token may be issued on Bitcoin using public APIs or services and this token may live in both the private blockchain and the Bitcoin public blockchain. Owners of the keys or wallet would be able to transfer the token or asset with either public or private blockchain interactions. The Level 5 node may be used to track this asset between the blockchains as well as keep them in sync with each other.

&gt;This system seems entirely external to Ethereum apart from writing some data on chain at the end of the day (as one of many chains), is that correct?

Though it may seem this way, Ethereum is leveraged in many different ways. Some of it is explained in the proposal, such as the compatibility with any and all Ethereum based wallets and applications, as well as the Interchain. Dragonchain also runs their own Ethereum node. They're blockchain and currency agnostic, but as explained it makes most sense to leverage Ethereum for the many advantages, security, and ongoing active development it has to offer, while simultaneously be interoperable with any and all legacy systems and or other blockchains for flexibility and adoption reasons, and much more. I **highly recommend** reading [this extensive article from BitBuyTheCoin](https://den.social/l/Dragonchain/09f09bdf58fc4856a7bb378c26a15ef2/blockchain-interoperability-is-solved-with-interchain/) as I can never explain it any better myself.

&gt;You emphasize that Disney helped start it yet (I think) they’re not involved at this point, at least as not as much as they used to be, why?

It took Joe Roets and the team great efforts and lengths to open source from The Walt Disney Company, and as of right now the history is the only active connection, and the team itself has always made this very clear. 

The history there is that, many years ago Disney called Joe Roets, and relocated him and his family to Seattle, to build what was then called the Disney Private Blockchain Platform inside the company. 

''When I got the call from Disney, that’s when I was, okay that’s a company that has so many potential use cases, I would be a little freer to really test out this architecture right. And so they moved my family up to Seattle, and there’s a Seattle office, and we started building out the core Dragonchain infrastructure. And we started trying to figure out who would want to try it? Hackathons, and things like that. And we got a lot of people calling us out to ask, does this crazy idea makes sense? And for me as an architect the whole point of the exercise was to throw the architecture up against the rocks. And see where it broke, and to see what feedback we got. And that was the really important part because we found a lot of things that we hadn’t expected. Nothing broke because it was a very effectively flexible architecture, but there were things that we were able to add because once we realized oh they want to do this which we could do, we could do this thing over here, and we continued to do that, even with the the commercial platform. And everything else that we’re constantly finding new capabilities and new possibilities for products''. 

In the limited Open Source Money documentary product by Vision Tree, aired on Discovery Science Channel in the US, some insights were provided as to why the open source route was taken later on. And the documentation provided above shows how near impossible it is to open source something from The Walt Disney Company, though they have had plenty of other great open source projects coming out of them for the same reasons. 

In his communication with the community, Joe always made clear that open sourcing this technology is the only way, and the right way to succeed. ""Releasing the source code to the public was always part of our plan,"" said Joe Roets, founder and CEO of Dragonchain. ""With this release, we believe the potential impact can be maximized by the blockchain community, offering opportunities for developers and driving more real use cases in the blockchain space.''

fznxivj,VictorCobra,8,"&gt;holding NANO has lost money since it’s inception.

Maybe since when you and most people (including me) first bought. However, NANO (formerly XRB) is still up over 10x against Bitcoin since March 2017 and well over 100x against the USD. Still way better than most alts. I think people should measure altcoin performance across cycles, and I don't think we've seen the next market cycle yet. If anything, we're only in the beginning. And there's still the whole possibility that crypto is just part of the global asset bubble. 

The real concerning things here are NANO's sustained drop below the top 50, and its lack of liquidity.  Since it's still well up, it has a long way to fall, in theory. But for now I have faith in their community.

Over a million subscribers and you have like 8 mods. Hello? Mods have definately been biased against many coins and they should probably publically announce % of what coins they have and whether or not they work in crypto/finance whatever.

The daily discussions are kinda pointless today I realized. Either this pumps blah blah, scam coin blah, occasionally links to articles are posted but will see deleted comments a lot. Little discussion and mostly bashing.

What if there was a public wiki about each coin and how they have been attacked, pros, cons, etc? Iota shutdown for a day, Verge 51% attack, rgb secret 51% attack (?), ravencoin (a coin I like and hold) overprinting possibly purposely, the list goes on.

Also the funny part about nano is that it is a working product. How many working products do you see in top 100 or 200? Oh and that are NOT stable coins, exchange coins etc.

Even at this point what if I said I'm all in on bitcoin? Am I shill now? It moves slower than dirt, will never see transactions below $1 again, lightning network been in development since at least 2017, HUGE waste of energy (made some localish residents very upset when their electricty rates double/trippled).

ETH is promising because it can do so much more than just be a coin to transfer value, but it's also less certain. PoS and sharding would be great milestones and prove that ETH can evolve. Unlike BTC, where the technically conservative community can't even agree on a modest increase of the blocksize.

I'll probably edit this with additional quotes as I read this but the first one that stands out is this:

""An analogy is that investing in bitcoin today is akin to investing in Facebook when it had 50 
million users with the potential to grow to the more than 2 billion users it has today""

Edit:

The majority of the paper is what I would call Bitcoin 101. It's followed up about current issues of the pandemic and de-globalization and their affects on bitcoin's price and adoption.

It discusses the investment made by Paul Tudor and how that was a watershed moment to open the door for other hedge funds.

One section I found interesting was related to millennials; as follows:

""Great wealth transfer

A report released by Coldwell Banker in October 2019 shared data around the transfer of $68 trillion in 
wealth to millennials, estimated to be one of the most substantial transfers of wealth historically. The 
study also found that there are almost 620,000 millennial millionaires in the United States, about 2% 
of the population of millionaires in the U.S. The millennial demographic (those born between 1981 to 
1996) is more open to novel, digitally native alternatives versus legacy products and services and more 
comfortable holding new types of investments. 
This open-mindedness has been shaped in part by the 2008 financial crisis. Entering the workforce 
at such an inopportune time instilled a level of skepticism towards the traditional banking system. 
According to WEF’s 2017 Global Shapers Survey, 45% of the 30,000 millennials surveyed said they 
disagree with the statement that they trust banks to be fair and honest.xiii Edelman’s October 2018 
survey of affluent millennials (those aged 24-38 with $50K in investable assets or $100K in individual or 
joint income) found that 77% of affluent millennials believe “the whole financial system is designed to 
favor the rich and powerful” and that “it’s just a matter of time before the bad behavior of the financial 
industry leads us into another global financial crisis.”xiv
There is also evidence that the millennial demographic’s affinity to hold bitcoin relative to legacy stores 
of value such as gold is high. According to Nate Geraci, president of investment advisor, ETF Store, 
anecdotally, about 90% of their millennial clients said they prefer bitcoin to goldxv - “It’s a landslide.” 
According to a November 2019 Millennials and the Future of Money report by Edelman, 63% of “crypto 
users” said crypto is a better investment than gold in a volatile economy""

The final sentence of the conclusion goes :

""Bitcoin’s strength is that it has properties that allow it to serve multiple functions, further hardening the likelihood of its success as measured by growth in value.""

This is a good paper to read, especially for some newer folks here, but interesting tidbits of information for those at all levels.",2020-07-31 04:02:01

fzs4ll4,63db346d,9,"* There is no built in pyramid scheme in IOTA, the whole infrastructure doesn't induce the systemic slavery of the poor
* unlike mining/staking pools, the project aims at true decentralization, the consensus quorum in IOTA 2.0 is going to be much higher than other Blockchain projects
* IOTA's vision is future proof: if there are better technological options in the future for improvements, IOTA can adopt them. The users and the service providers of the system are not in conflict of interest, there is no reason to not adopt better tech for IOTA
* strong academic background: the IOTA Foundation (IF) works together with some of the most significant universities in Europe, those universities dedicate lots of resources to IOTA. And also the research team at the IF is extremely strong (take a look at this tweet  https://twitter.com/billatnapier/status/1260691063339188231?s=20 )
* the IF really knows well how to present stuff in a visually appealing way (which is quite important for the adoption of the technology imho)
* standardization of IOTA as the default DLT solution world wide is already on its way with pretty significant players like the Object Management Group, Eclipse Foundation and Linux Foundation. IOTA already translates to prestige in the open source scene.
* the community behind IOTA is organic and real, visionary people are behind IOTA, the community is extremely strong and its full of builders. Even the critics watching over the project closely are well educated and are permanently questioning every minor decision. Alone according to the community size, we could easily says that IOTA deserves to be in top 10
* unlike Bitcoin, IOTA has no inflation and no fees, in my eyes it is going to be the first truly decentralized cryptocurrency without utilizing any shenanigans to be kept alive. 
* While to some degree you can call most coins an ""Altcoin"" of Bitcoin, IOTA is far more than just a cryptocurrency, its the first of its kind, it is there to not only secure value transactions, but also zero-value transactions, which is definitively a game changer and obviously a huge factor in its adoption so far
* all those hundreds of patents mentioning IOTA from fortune 500 companies, all those crazy partnerships are only confirming that the industry already sees the value in IOTA in its primitive alpha version form and they invest money and resources in it.
* the price is almost in all time low, perfect timing for investing, especially considering that after years of research, the first prototypes for a Coordinator-less IOTA are finally there, and the TestNets look very promising. 
* by having reusable addresses and sub 10 second transactions soon with the Chrysalis update big exchanges are going to be able to integrate IOTA way easier
* the IOTA Foundation is always one step ahead of the game, they already have plans for extreme scalability with a wonderful sharding concept, and there are advancements like the multiverse approach promising multiple magnitudes of more scalability. They always got some secret weapons ;)
* the project has an extremely clean start, the IF is registered as non-profit foundation in Germany, the initial crowd sale was extremely fair, no shady things like reserved supply etc. This is not a VC project. They achieved all this with only $500k. A clean start and a clean history matter A LOT. The IF got its IOTA's from donations after the initial crowd sale, they didn't keep anything to themselves
* the IOTA Foundation is very strong with about 100 extremely skilled people working making IOTA happen, yet, although they got probably a huge burn rate, they already have many different income streams, and the IF is on its way to completely become independent of selling its IOTA's.
* the IOTA foundation is strongly supported by EU, you can clearly see that if you pay attention, see the CityXChange project as a quick example
* the IF as well as the builders in the community are not scared to try new things out. No risk, no fun, those guys understand very well what science is about, what invention is about, they don't copy paste like the remaining 99% of all other projects in the scene but they try to build novel technologies instead.
* the IF is permanently in communication with industry players and tries to understand their needs and solve real world problems. See eclipse work group TangleEE in this context https://tangle.ee/

Those were just the points which instantly came into my mind, there is still soooo much to tell, I could go on and on, but I am getting tired :D Maybe see https://iotaarchive.com/ for more reasons why to invest in IOTA and to make up your own opinion.

\&gt;David Golumbia’s excellent book The Politics of Bitcoin: Software as Right-Wing Extremism outlines the rabbit-hole effect that this ecosystem is having on software engineers onboarding them into deeper forms of right-wing extremism.

Sounds like he has veered off into a comedy routine now. If you aren't laughing out loud after reading this then maybe you take yourself a little too seriously? Pretty sad that Hoskinson felt the need to even respond to this intellectual posturing. I thought people grew out of that after college when they entered the real world? Funny how he didn't mention Haskell's use at Raytheon or Lockheed. For such an intellectual guy his reasoning is hilariously cave-like: crypto bad.

Well, we can't rag on him too hard since he's not the adult in the room. Maybe he can come around one day.

(P.S. Anyone know if next month's right wing extremist crypto meeting is still on or was it rescheduled for September?)",2020-07-31 07:01:59
