quetzalcoatl555,investing in robux instead of bitcoin to own the libs,ghmjsno,2021-01-01 03:03:30,6
Thisisgentlementtt,"Happy new year everyone. 

I have been a part of the ""Bitcoin scene"" since 2012. This is the first time I am starting to feel like ""I've made it"". All my friends who mined in 2011 and 2012 thought I was stupid buying in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.

I think Bitcoin will grow in value ""always"". 1mil/Bitcoin is obvious at this point. Amount of fiat will always increase. Bitcoin will be the only asset in the world where supply does not increase with demand. 

There will never be a person in history who will buy Bitcoin, who will not be early. If you know what I mean. 

I love you all. I read almost every comment every day. ""Hopefully"" I won't ""have to"" in the somewhat near future. But even then I will come back every now and then to see what's up. In a fashion that I'd wish /u/yolotrades would sometimes do, that he never(?) Has.",ghmku9n,2021-01-01 03:12:23,3
georgedonnelly,"This is simultaneously hilarious, ironic and embarrassing. I and my team are the primary subjects of this documentary (which uses a ton of my own video footage) and all of my efforts are with Bitcoin Cash since 14 months ago.

Dash is a dying coin. And the Dash fanatics/haters know it in their hearts, so don't brigade the thread denying it.

Our greatest competition for BCH is our own resistance to moving forward at a rapid pace to build out our use cases and the robustness of things like chained transactions, smart contracts, OP codes, etc. 

I expect we will definitively overcome that in 2021.

* NW up to $656,584 from $538,713 (excluding pensions).
* Maxed out 401ks and Roth IRAs. 
* Upped my taxable investments to match raises.
* Refi'd mortgage to 3.125%.
* $200 per paycheck to daughters 529
* Completed the most grueling year of grad school ever while maintaining my savings rate.
* Survived COVID parenting, school, and work.
* Used the leftover ""beer and restaurant money"" to buy bitcoin for shits'n giggles.

**2021 Projections**

* No NW goals; just keeping the savings on auto.
* No more school payments! Invest the difference. 
* Refi again for rate in the 2's.
* Start post school side gig and put 100% of money earned into savings account for real estate.
* Keep contributions to 401k and 529. Income might exceed Roth limits this year so will have to look more seriously into the backdoor option.

2020 was a mixed bag. Finances did really well. I got COVID from work in September and as a result got super behind with grad work and it absolutely destroyed my strength and conditioning goals. I did manage to rehab and old running injury and learn to enjoy running again. I was kind of a deadbeat dad due to so much work but I got to manage the bed time routine and read books to her every night so I'll take that as a win in this insanely busy year.

Ideally 2021 would be the year my family pulls the trigger on an [Adventure Wagon](https://adventurewagon.com/) and gets some serious time on the ski slopes and in the mountains. I'd also like to squat 230 kg, bench 160 kg and run a marathon.

War2kali,"
I think I'm speaking for almost all of us when I say 2020 was the best of times and the worst of times. Most of it was shit, but our beloved bitcoin has turned around at the end like the unstoppable juggernaut that we know it to be. I see amazingly little weakness in the recent moves. Dips get bought up within hours. The ""dips"" are tiny compared to last run so far. I've never seen such relentless buying pressure. The 1d chart is something to behold. It's glorious and I see this powering into the 30s shortly. Not sure where it will end up in this cycle, but this bull run is not even half done. 
 
Just a few years ago, we couldn't dream of the news stories and progress that we've seen lately. Paypal making it easy to buy and pay for stuff with it? Public companies buying mass amounts? Not just bold software companies run by crazy visionaries (I salute you, Mr. Saylor), but stodgy insurance companies buying it, too? Old hedge funders buying it? Chatter about 1% allocations for everyone? Holy shit have we come far. 2021 looks amazing.

Peering into a murky crystal ball, the long term picture is very interesting. First of all, I think most people would agree that it's not in the interest of the US government to allow a competitor to the US dollar as the safest currency in the world. The US enjoys ridiculously low interest rates on its debt, among many other benefits, thanks to this, and when it changes there will be massive economic repercussions for the world, mostly negative for the US and positive for the new entrants. I expect a lot of people in the US govt to eventually realize that crypto is an enemy. However, right now it's not close to that point so it has been mostly ignored. 

While it's being ignored, bitcoin gathers strength. When Mnuchin proposed the new regulations recently, think about the forces arrayed opposite him. The ""cryptosphere"" would of course include all holders, the ever-growing number of companies in the sector, etc. These forces are growing exponenentially along with the bitcoin price. There may come a tipping point where the government realizes the threat and moves aggressively to neutralize it. The question is whether pro-crypto interests will be able to successfully oppose government moves at that point. Bitcoin is brilliantly designed in so many ways, and one of those ways is the under-the-radar steady growth in strength of pro-crypto interests. Here's to hoping that the allure of easy tax revenue and a critical mass of crypto companies/investors will stop the potential effort to snuff it out. A comforting thought is that only forward-thinking people would realize the threat crypto poses to the US dollar and the government is elected by voters who don't think further ahead than the current year. Thus the crazy deficits and debt. 

The best of both worlds is where we all coexist and prosper. The government realizes its stupidity and both raises taxes in some ways that don't hurt growth (I am a capitalist - does capitalism need billionaires to function as an economic system? no, it does not), cuts expenses (defense budget is a no-brainer), allows moderate inflation to defray the debt over time (the Fed recently very clearly warned everyone to expect higher inflation over the upcoming years), and stops the downward spiral it's currently on. It can use the crypto tax revenue to help other structural reforms (eg marijuana legalization will both increase tax revenues and decrease law enforcement/prison expenses and currently is steadily spreading around the US) and everyone lives happily ever after.",ghn7acf,2021-01-01 06:32:31,5

Perhaps, but don't trust predictions. No one can predict the price. It could be anywhere from 5k to 300k in 2021. IMHO 80-150k is certainly possible mid 2021

&gt;Surely we should buy some now while it’s cheap and hold it for years?

You should invest in bitcoin regardless because :

1) Its an uncorrelated asset class so you make your portfolio more diversified and hedged thus safe while you return higher earnings

deedledoodle1,"Long time lurker. Thought some of you might enjoy my crypto story.

Two years ago I was bored around the holidays and decided to invest in what was considered to be one of the major crypto coins of the time, XRP. I did some due diligence on protecting those assets and decided to buy a ledger crypto wallet to store the currency. 

The Ledger arrived in nice packaging and included some lengthy setup instructions that felt like a mini puzzle. Even though it was just a glorified USB drive, having a physical device to accompany the digital investment somehow solidified this feeling that I was investing in a cutting edge technology. And yet, despite these feelings, after getting the device actually setup I encountered numerous errors trying to transfer the assets from the coin marketplace to the Ledger device. Considering my rather nominal investment of $100 I decided to just leave the currency in my marketplace profile. 

Fast forward to September of this year, I started to receive text messages from random numbers stating “1.2352 Bitcoin was transferred from your Ledger wallet to Russia. Click this link to reset your Ledger password.” I honestly didn’t think much of this at the time because I was also receiving multiple text messages each day telling me to register to vote. And, because I was never actually able to transfer any assets to my Ledger it was easy to ignore the phishing attempts.

In early December, my SO asked about the value of my crypto investment. Given Bitcoin’s bull run at the time, I was actually excited to check the market and, sure enough, my $100 investment was valued around $200.  We discussed whether I should just cash out or let it sit. I decided to let it sit with the hopes of seeing the value continue to grow. My SO thought it would be better for me to cash out and spend it on a hobby item. 

Then, things started to unravel. Later in December I received an email from Ledger stating my personal information had been compromised in the consumer database hack. I was incredibly frustrated, especially because I never even had a chance to successfully use the stupid device. I checked the XRP price once again and with my investment sitting at around $170 I decided to stick with my plan of letting it grow. 

Well, then I received a separate email from the coin marketplace stating that XRP trading would be halted due to SEC action against XRP. I checked the value of my $100 investment and the $70 profit had turned into a $30 loss. 

So here I am sharing my story with you all. My two year, $100 foray into cryptocurrency left me with a funky USB drive I could never get to work, my personal information being stolen, and a 30% loss on my investment. I think I’ll just stick with stocks and bonds from here on out.

Did Bitcoin go up because it can do more transactions per second? Because someone invented a new use case? Because Amazon/Starbucks/Disney started accepting it at all locations?

Perringer,"&gt;I’m currently using Robinhood

I do hope we've caught you before you've put your entire $50k into Robinhood. You should do some more research into bitcoin and how to hold it before you put more money into it. It's not just about its price rising, as wonderful as that seems.

On Robinhood - you don't own Bitcoin: you own Robinhood's promise of Bitcoin's price. The only thing you can do with your Bitcoin there is to sell them, and you may not want to do that when it gets valuable enough - there will be other things you can do with your bitcoin. 

Also, if your account on Robinhood is hacked, or they're hacked, or they become insolvent, or they decide they no longer want you as a customer for some obscure violation of their TOS, you lose everything.

If you use a reputable exchange (Pro.coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, etc.), then you are free to take your Bitcoin into your personal possession using a hardware wallet, once your fiat deposit clears. This is ""being your own bank"", and there are some things you need to know about how to keep it safe doing that, as well. If you do storage properly, no one, ever, can take your bitcoin away from you.  This keeps your bitcoin safe if your exchange or account falls prey to any of the things I just described for Robinhood.

As bitcoin becomes more valuable, you will be able to use bitcoin to earn interest, or as collateral against loans. You can already do this, but more and more secure and reputable companies will begin doing this as bitcoin's price rises.  This will give you financial power and sovereignty that few will be able to achieve without bitcoin in the future.",ghrnnrr,2021-01-02 07:38:12,7

bitusher,"Absolutely. I think Luke goes too far into calling litecoin a scam, but I would consider it a pointless project for these reasons-

litecoin is a pointless obsolete coin these days and basically just copies bitcoins code with some unique and pointless features:

1) 4 x more coins so less scarce than BTC (negative quality)

2) ""Silver to Bitcoins Gold"" marketing lie Charlie started because silver is used due to impracticality of dividing gold for small purchases and this has never been a limitation of Bitcoin like physical gold has. Bitcoin is extremely divisible , even down to 1/1000 of a sat

3) SCRYPT algo instead of SHA256 was supposed to be ASIC proof and this turned out not to be true . All ltc mining is done with ASICS these days and We now know that GPU mining is not even a desirable trait that LTC originally promoted as being unique regardless

4) Faster block reward with confirmations around 2.5 min instead of 10 min . This is pointless because it leads to greater problems with using the blockchain in space and the Poisson process still means that it might take 30+ minutes to find a block at times in LTC. What people need is instant confirmations regardless which is why Bitcoin created lightning wallets

5) low fees , Bitcoin has low fees of sub penny to 0 within scalable payment channels making LTC pointless. Most alts have low fees onchain because no one uses them and because they aren't worth much so you can't assume a popular blockchain will remain low fees onchain and should assume the opposite which is why you need to scale in layers.

This is also probably relevant: Bittrex had relatively relaxed KYC procedures for the first few years of its life and has been in battle with US regulators over it: [https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/26592/bittrex-and-bitfinex-appear-to-step-up-kyc-controls-in-wake-of-regulatory-entanglements](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/26592/bittrex-and-bitfinex-appear-to-step-up-kyc-controls-in-wake-of-regulatory-entanglements)

This explains Erik Voorhees' tweet (CEO of Shapeshift, which removed support for privacy coins in November) from a couple of hours ago as well, in which he says: *Jake... you might not realize why they are actually being removed.  Some day I hope to be able to discuss it*. [https://twitter.com/ErikVoorhees/status/1345100565735378947](https://twitter.com/ErikVoorhees/status/1345100565735378947) 

The reason Shapeshift removed support for privacy coins a couple of months ago is specifically because the regulators had accused Shapeshift of being involved in money laundering.

Kraken, OTOH, has had extremely strong KYC from very early on-- if you search early reddit posts about Kraken, folks were very unhappy about how strict Kraken's verification procedures were; from 3 years ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5lsjml/beware\_use\_kraken\_hold\_and\_enforced\_amlkyc\_even/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5lsjml/beware_use_kraken_hold_and_enforced_amlkyc_even/)

FWIW, I think that what we are now likely to see is a strong bifurcation on XMR where there will be maybe three classes of exchanges that will support xmr:  
(1) High-end exchanges US with strong KYC procedures (Kraken, Gemini/ZCash) (Note: I hold no zcash, but am mentioning it because I think xmr/zcash/dash are grouped together in the minds of regulators)  
(2) Non-US exchanges  
(3) (Maybe) new classes of decentralized exchanges that are enabled by atomic swaps

Anyways, putting it all together: the story that is emerging is that this is part of a settlement to a lawsuit or something similar. Overall, I think that folks should think about this bittrex event more like [shapeshift.io](https://shapeshift.io) than like Kraken, Binance, or OKex. That is, it is totally not obvious that there is another shoe that will drop.",ghrygd3,2021-01-02 09:17:53,20
sos755,"&gt;she thought I was crazy and in some bitcoin cult and unable to be financially responsible.

Regardless of how much money you have made, you are exactly as described. It sounds to me like you chose your bitcoin fantasy over her.

Imagine a roulette player that is convinced that the next number will be 00. They tell everyone how it will be 00. They talk about how rich they will be when 00 hits. They join groups that believe that 00 will hit next, and they spend all of their time discussing how 00 will hit next. They spend all of their time thinking about how 00 will hit next. Their life revolves around 00 hitting next.

* Another thing, a trend I've noticed in the past month is that when mex starts trading at a negative premium to spot, BTC proceeds to make a new ATH in 5-20 hours from the start of that (presumably from the buyers overtaking and the short squeeze fuel adding fuel to the fire)

* Here's a snapshot of the last 3 days... https://www.tradingview.com/x/F69MZsdM/  Notice the premium indicator started showing the trending toward negative (red line) as we got toward 29k. Then it went negative (bottom left yellow box) and the length of that box is only about 11 hours before new ath again... and now (right yellow box) we've been negative again for about 10 hours, so, maybe we get highs in 10 hours or less again.

Sargos,"Bittrex just delisted all privacy coins including Monero, which is worrying for the cypherpunks among us. I want to share why I'm not worried in the long run. Monero is like Bitcoin, it just does one thing, can't interoperate trustlessly with anything else, and relies on centralized institutions for liquidity but it's a good proof of concept that cannot be stopped.

Privacy is inevitable and will exist in Ethereum which will never be delisted from exchanges. Instant, private by default, and nearly free zkRollup L2s like Aztec will be coming online this year. These are completely trustless and cannot be turned off. You cannot stop anyone who has access to Ethereum from using them and even protocols like Baseline have privacy by default as it's a core requirement for corporations for obvious reasons. Privacy is here to stay and is becoming increasingly easier to use. It'll be fun to watch whatever drama occurs but there is a 100% chance that my kids will live in a world where privacy is a given and people will wonder what it was like to live in the current world.",ghsz0ny,2021-01-02 15:15:27,10

Eodmg,"I think something we'll have to accept is that the narrative this cycle is gonna be dominated by ""digital gold"". As much as we like to tout technology and as much as bitcoin likes to tout their strong libertarian bent, the vast majority of us are in it as a get rich quick scheme. This is evidenced by how much the bitcoin/ethereum market cap crashes in percentage terms each cycle. Believing in something =/= investing it it. It's easy to say that the reason why ethereum outperformed bitcoin last cycle was because of better technology and fundamentals, but I think a better and simpler explanation was that the ICO's represented an even bigger get rich quick scheme than bitcoin at the time. This is why the eth/bitcoin ratio peaked in the middle of june 2017 and not jan 2018 - because bitcoin and eth are legitimately decoupled. Bitcoin will drag eth up on days like this, but if you want to see ratio gains, there has to be a simple, easy to explain reason why eth will make you rich. We can see this in the example of yield farming in august vs the more developed defi now. We have way more value locked now than then, but eth2 staking and defi protocols are way less sexy than yield farming back in august. I think people sitting around and complaining about ratio gains are misguided. Eth's technology potential is already priced in to some extent. Every day eth doesn't produce a new SEXY protocol, we should expect to see ratio decay. The way I see it, eth outperforms btc this cycle if and only if it comes out with another, easily pitchable, hypeable protocol. If you're betting on eth, that's what you're betting on. If you're not willing to bet on that this cycle, then you should probably just sell your eth holdings and buy btc. Personally, I am betting on that and I have 99.5% of my holdings in eth.",ghum4it,2021-01-03 03:44:23,13

SenatusSPQR,"&gt; People who love NANO, how can you still love it when it hasn’t moved much in price since it crashed in 2017. What kept you interested?

First of all, I agree that the price performance has been surprisingly lacking for the past 2 years or so. I'm not mad or annoyed about it, but definitely surprised.

The reason I love it so much is that I came into the crypto space to have a digital decentralised currency. To me personally it wasn't even about the massive gains. It became clear to me at some point that Bitcoin wasn't what I thought it was, and I came across Nano and was just blown away. Ever since, I've been looking for something that's *better* than Nano as a decentralised currency and haven't been able to find it. 

I think that if there's any cryptocurrency that has a shot at actual adoption, at being used as an actual currency by a large group of people, it's Nano. It's the fastest cryptocurrency, it's feeless, decentralised, scales using whatever resources available, has decentralisation incentivised in the protocol, and it's very energy efficient. It doesn't have privacy on the first layer, but aside from that it's pretty close to perfection in terms of being a currency, and this alone makes it a top pick for me already (and is what got me into it).

However, what I noticed when I actually started looking into it more was the community. As you're noticing now on Reddit, there is a rather large and vocal community around it. People can see this as shilling, sure, but there are just a lot of enthusiasts following from how good the tech is. And this community is pretty cool, the subreddit is very active and open for discussion, it's a generally generous community (tipping Nano on the make a millionaire threads, Nano Tip bot, and most recently [WeNano app](https://wenano.net/)). It's the same on Twitter - huge community there, always engaging in good spirits. It just feels like the genuine crypto mindset and community spirit.

Then to top that off, there's a ton of development happening on Nano itself, but also by developers building stuff on Nano. I just posted this somewhere else as well so I'll just paste: there's [Unreal Engine Nano](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/jktalj/a_3d_crypto_transaction_visualizer_with_vr_and/), [Nendly](https://nendly.com/) (Reddit but with Nano), [RoboCash app granted patent](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/j7dwub/nano_based_patent_granted_to_robocash_fyncom/), the Nalli SMS wallet with which you can send anyone with a phone number some Nano, [CoinEmbed](https://twitter.com/kilrizzy/status/1316140323681296386) under development, Nano on Guarda Wallet, [PlayNano](https://playnano.online/) allows buying games, giftcards, mobile top-ups, and gambling, [many excellent NanoBuildoff projects](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/him6e6/monthly_nano_news_june_2020/), the ability to [create tokens on Nano](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/kmxtjt/you_can_now_create_tokens_on_nano_thanks_to/), and on and on and on.

I've always thought of it this way. In *every* sense Nano is a top 10 cryptocurrency, except for the price. If the price were to go to $40 today, it wouldn't be a huge bubble, it would just make sense if you compare it to other projects up there. So I've had no reason to become less optimistic and less interested in Nano, since everything has kept improving except for the price. I believe the price will be catching up to the true value soon :)",ghzk5r4,2021-01-04 04:59:16,19

I was able to exit both the dot com boom and the 2017 bitcoin boom before the following crashes, and bought back in later. I'm not really a holder as a market melts down, but in hindsight just holding would have worked too.  

Major surprises:   
Success in tech does not mean success in other fields or life generally.   
In hindsight, I wish I invested even more in tech.   
Divorce is expensive, but worth it! (in my case)

My advice if you are in your 20s: Set up your career in a field that will have growth for the foreseeable future (30+ years). Renewable energy, biotech, crypto/DeFi. Believe in and build a better future and invest in it. Get an insiders view of your industry which will help you recognize opportunities.

&gt;The financing of projects through stocks have been an integral part of why our economies have grown so much since the 18th century.

financing stuff through issuing stocks and bonds? that's useful. making money through passing those stocks around afterwards? not so much. making money through passing numbers you just made up around? phenomenally useless

&gt; As for bitcoin, it concerns the beginning of an innovative decentralized way of doing transactions offering security, efficiency and cutting out middlemen for the consumer.

no, it doesn't. blockchains are a bad answer to a question no-one was asking. they use 1% of the world's power to create an infrastructure capable of handling a tiny fraction of the transaction capability a large city needs. if 50% of a network is controlled by one actor, they can literally do what they want with the network - double spend, ignore your transactions, whatever. the only problem that bitcoin solved was ""how can i buy drugs?""

- Conflates L2 with sidechains and other L1s, as L2s use the L1 security for settlement purposes

- Ignores that L2 tx settle on L1 taking up blockspace thus accruing value to the L1 token

- Says assets will take over yet ignores how those assets will settle or what protocols they'll use

- Says Ethereum is slow and expensive which mean it's very popular and highly used, but then says it's not important

- Says L2s will be fragmented when in reality they're almost all being developed to accommodate the EVM or Solidity in some way

I would like to give a commendation to u/Antranik especially. It is refreshing to see someone post their trades **before** they happen, and from what I notice he has been catching many winning trades going in both directions this entire runup. To me you are the mvp, my dude.

I haven't seen the Jack Dorsey letter to FinCEN regarding the supposed regulations coming up posted here yet. I think it is mandatory reading if you have been in this for a while and now are making solid gains. Its pretty damn informative on what might be coming and I hope won't. Posted below.

[https://squareup.com/us/en/press/fincen-letter](https://squareup.com/us/en/press/fincen-letter)

I speculate Jack Dorsey is the future Elon lite in like 5 years.

I also think what we need now is a fundamental use case for bitcoin that will get people involved.

I remember in early 2017 the ethereum sub had the ability to tip comments in eth which I quite enjoyed and engaged me to post higher quality content. People actually tipped me and I was even able to it to my wallet and I still have that tiny fraction locked away since then which is maybe worth 100 bucks now. After it went away I didn't really post anymore.

If we had something like that here I would have totally tipped u/imissusenet about his post last night stating he sets his dip catches at 9%, 18%, 27%, 36%. If you message me your btc addess i'll send you some still. 

So far I have missed every dip since crossing 20k.

Some open ended questions with no right answer that I would just like to hear your judgement of it:

1) I am wondering why some organizations like coinbase and cashapp have the ability to withdraw your coins but other companies like paypal and robinhood don't. Is it some sort of regulations issue or are they just not as competent? 

2) Is the withdrawal of coins difficult to program?

3) As one of the biggest proponents of crypto and the creator of one of the biggest social media companies in the world, why doesn't Jack Dorsey implement a tipping system on Twitter utilizing Bitcoin? Would this be extremely difficult to do? Or again is it a regulations issue? Or does he simply think it would not be a very enjoyable/useful feature to tip users posts in bitcoin?

Nythoren,"Apologies in advance for the novel.  The TL;DR is that Tesla is a speculation stock that has gotten way out of hand.  

It's based on total speculation and an assumption that Tesla will be ""huge"".  They think it's the next Apple, with years and years of steady stock growth to ensure a profitable investment.  It's not based on fundamentals at all though.  There is a lot of crowing about how Tesla is now profitable.  Sure... but compare Tesla sales and revenue to Ford.  Tesla's market cap, today, is a little over 20x Ford's market cap, yet Ford has significantly higher sales and revenue.  And if/when states start to crack down on the online car sales (which allows Tesla to avoid a lot of the costs that other manufactures are forced to incur), there is no telling just how hard it will hurt sales and profits.  Tesla also doesn't provide dividends, making it one of the only auto manufacturers to provide none of its cash from sales back to its investors.  

Oh but Tesla's price is forward looking!  We're getting in early so we can get dem stonks before they rocket on those future sales!  OK, sure, I get that thinking...but again, Tesla is trading roughly 180x its projected 2021 earnings.  A 180 P/E is just crazy.  The rest of the auto industry averages around a 15x P/E, even with companies expected to dominate the industry for years to come.  Which means the current price has a 1200%+ increase in earnings built in to it beyond the already rosy 2021 earnings increase (and it's getting worse every day as the stock keeps rising).  Given that Tesla earnings are raising by \~15% annually, we're talking decades before its earnings catch up to today's price.  

Tesla is a lot like Bitcoin, honestly.  Its price is more of a meme-economy, almost to the level of being a Ponzi-scheme.  Folks believe it will be worth it, so they keep piling money in to it, which keeps inflating the price.  We saw a similar run on internet stocks in the late 90's, with money pouring in to internet stocks based on speculation instead of any hard data.  In 2001, that bubble burst.  Then we had the real estate bubble, with people throwing their life savings in to mortgage securities and bank stocks.  That bubble burst, hard, in 2008.  The trick with Tesla will be to figure out when the right time is to bail, because when it finally starts to be priced on fundamentals instead of pure enthusiasm, it's going to crater.  

Look what happened to poor Hertz; the internet decided it was a darling and propped the stock up with nothing but speculation.  When they went pink-sheet, over $4 billion in investments disappeared.  

I have no doubt that Tesla is going to be a successful company and make all kinds of money.  But that doesn't mean its stock price will ever be justified.",gi8gkje,2021-01-06 07:37:36,45

Ethical-trade,"We've heard a lot of ""*when your friends will call you about crypto, that's the top*"" over the past few months.

Honestly, I doubt it very seriously.

The major difference between this run and the previous ones is that bitcoin is now a household name. It has been since the previous cycle. As soon as btc hit its recent ATH, it was one the homepage of CNBC, CNN, ... 

It's everywhere: ""bicoin this"", ""bitcoin that"", ""crypto"", ""bitcoin"", and sometimes, even ""eth"" too.

Of course your friends will ask you if you're ""*the crypto guy*"", crypto is all over the news. There are blockchain documentaries, books, communities, and more importantly, a decade long history of success.

This time I don't think that having friends and family asking questions means that the top has been reached. It's simply a consequence of crypto having gone big.

There will be massive red days that's for sure, possibly more than 30% corrections.

I know conspiracy theories give comfort as it provides a reason for why the reality you think should exist doesn't actually, but the truth is really that the people invested in other cryptos don't see nano as a threat. They are invested in those cryptos because they think about them the same way you think about nano. So in the same way you can't fathom how anyone could not see nano as the best, they feel that about bitcoin or eth or whatever.

temp_plus,"I focused on game theory when I studied economics in college. Bitcoin wins against every currency, asset, altcoin, and precious metal in the long run. Here is some game theory thinking for anyone interested:

It took 6,000 years to make an infinitely scarce asset where supply is permanently fixed as demand increases. This is unprecedented as anything that becomes a store of value has a game theory incentive from suppliers to enter the market and produce more of, diluting its value in the long run. Demand for Bitcoin is coming from bonds, stocks, real estate, gold, and currency seeking a store-of-value safe haven as the liquidity loops propping up these markets begin to collapse due to hyperinflation.

Once Bitcoin exists, it is impossible to recreate another infinitely scarce asset to kill Bitcoin. The reason being, c*reating an infinitely scarce asset to kill the first infinitely scarce asset is Catch-22*. By minting more of a different asset to achieve the narrative that it is more scarce than the first asset that cannot be minted more of, your asset is already inferior to the first asset. The reason being, by minting an infinitely scarce asset, you are creating more of stuff even if the supply is capped at a fixed amount.

It is basically the inverse of a central bank with the same cancerous issue. Central banks are stuck with one currency but they can mint as much of it as possible - Blockchain engineers are stuck with a single supply cap but can mint as many new currencies as possible. Same problem, different flavor. This is why Bitcoin is so unusual from a game theory perspective, once the protocol exists as an infinitely scarce asset, it eats every other asset (including other infinitely scarce protocols) that behaves as a store of value in the long run. Everything that tries to compete with Bitcoin will lose since there is no ""second"" store-of-value investment that comes after Bitcoin.",gid9ju9,2021-01-07 09:37:19,60

NystromWrites,"&gt;**DISGUISES &amp; DESTRUCTION**

""You're overthinking it. You probably just took a nap and...felt disoriented afterwards. Happens all the time."" The Doctor laughed softly, then walked out of the office.

Why was no one taking this seriously?

I took the bus home- I didn't trust myself to drive anymore- and grumbled the whole way home. I was *sure* something wasn't right, but what was it?

In a flash of inspiration, I knew what to do. I would record myself sleeping tonight- and put some kind of GPS tracker in my phone, so I would know where I'd gone! I had no wife or roommates to watch out for me, so this would have to do.

I made the necessary preparations and went to bed. After a long, fitful, anxious night, I finally succumbed to sleep's embrace.

I woke up- I was *so* sore, like I'd been working out for hours. I had a few bruises, too. One on my thigh, one on my left bicep, and it felt like I had a big one on my back.

I sat up- despite the soreness in my abs- and checked my computer recording.

Wait- it was April *seventh?!* I had lost three whole days!

I skipped to the beginning of the recording, watching through it at triple speed- searching for the moment I got up-

As I woke on the recording, I immediately took my phone out of my pants pocket and threw it on the bed, then left the room. *Damn it!* I groaned. This didn't tell me anything.

What else could I do? Embed the GPS in my damn arm?!

Wait...yes, yes I could. I had *just* enough know-how to get that done, in fact.

I picked up everything I needed- rubbing alcohol, the goods from the electronics store- twelve hours, three hundred dollars, and one sore arm later, and I was implanted with a GPS device with enough juice in the battery to last at least a week. Perfect.

I went to sleep one more time- but something was different. I felt more awake. I felt *ready*.

At about four A.M., there was a knock on my door. I sat up and tossed my phone on my bed- I was lucid this time. I was *pretending* I wasn't- unless I was always lucid for this? I had no way of knowing.

I answered the knock. A tall, extremely fit man stood on the other side- muscles bulged under a fitted white V-neck, which stood out in stark contrast to his dark skin. ""Let's go, Janus.""

""Yeah."" I said, as though it was a natural thing to do.

It was like I had two different halves to my brain- one was a freelance graphic designer, and was *very* alarmed by what was going on.  The other was confident, strong- and was fully aware of my day-by-day persona.

""So- hey, what's going on?"" I asked. 

""Oh, you've brought along the Civilian tonight?"" My partner asked. How did I know he was my partner?

""Seems he's tagging along."" The words came out of my mouth- but I didn't choose to speak them.

""I am so confused.""

""Don't worry about it."" I replied to myself- and then I fell asleep.


I woke up once more, covered in bruises, and sore. It had been two days.


""What the hell?!"" I roared at myself in the mirror. I went to my computer and looked up 'private investigator'. I paid using Bitcoin- and I waited.


Seven days later, I woke up again. There was a note attached to my computer. 

'Some guy paid me to follow you, Noctus, but I won't expose your real identity to the public. Keep doing what you do! - A Private Investigator.'

Notcus. As in- the superhero Noctus? The superhero who took out the entire White Knuckle clan, and their leader, Pyropyre?! That...that couldn't be me!

""It's not."" I answered myself, in Noctus's deeper, more self-assured voice. ""I might be you, but *you* are not me. You need to stop interfering, this is getting out of hand.""

""Whatever *you* are, this is my body, too! I want a say in this!""

Noctus chuckled. ""Nah. This is for the best. Now go to sleep.""

And so I slept.

I woke up again- I had no idea how long it had been. I felt like I had a massive headache- and it was so dark, aside from some fire light...was that a camp fire?

""You still with us, Noctus?!"" It was the same man from the other night. He had a cut on his forehead- it was bleeding, badly.

""No!"" I shouted.

""Ah, hell! Look, Civ- just run! You're no good to me, and we need to get Pyro *down!* Here he comes- get a move on!""

I laid eyes on Pyropyre- one of the most infamous villains of our age- and saw something that was so obvious, it was practically laughable. His puffy clothing was hiding a mech-suit.

""You do know that his fire is just coming from his suit, right?"" I asked my partner as I stood.

""W-what? How can you tell? Can you shut it off?""

""Y-yeah. Just...distract him. Let me get close.""

""You've got spunk after all!"" He shouted, then began taunting Pyro, running around him in circles.

I sprinted forward, heart pounding, and tackled Pyrotech to the ground. ""He can't fire at this angle, his fuel won't reach the uptake!"" I shouted to my partner.

""What?!"" Roared Pyrotech. ""I already killed you!""

""Nah, you just knocked him out- and there's two halves to this coin."" Where this smugness was coming from, I didn't know. I began to rip and tear at the mech suit until, finally, I found the part I needed most- the fuel canister. ""All done!""

""That was *crazy*, Noctus!""

""I'm not Noctus."" I objected as my partner slapped Pyro in shackles. 

""Right, right. Well-look, this guy is small time, but if we ever get to meet again, I'll give you a better nickname than Civ, right?"" 

""Sure thing."" I could feel as Noctus was beginning to wake up. ""And, hey, could you get Noctus to start leaving me notes, at least? Like- how many times do I need to run out of milk and toilet paper before he realizes he's being an ass?""

My partner laughed. ""I'll pass on the message.""

I fell asleep once again- and upon waking, I found another note on my shirt.

'You were kept asleep for a reason. You're too dangerous to be allowed free reign. Noctus is but a shade of your true potential. If you care for humanity, go back to sleep for good, disguised one.'

CellarAndShed,"I think this is a great move as you are doing something that you want to do, helping family, and Bitcoin is making it happen. No regrets.

However...and I say this more for everyone else, that's $240,000, minus taxes. You can (possibly) take the track of investing that amount relatively safely and conservatively and let the growth from the investment pay their house off gradually. You *always* would have the option to lump sum it in if you wanted to, but this way you basically just take over their payment for them while you get to keep all of your money. Once the house is paid off, that money keeps growing for you. And you can double 200 grand surprisingly quickly just putting it into VTSAX or something like that.

We have a lot of people here who are going to get quite wealthy, without advanced financial education (and many don't even have basic financial education). I want everyone to think very hard about how you can avoid actually spending your nest egg. Learn how wealthy people handle money...because many of us will *be* them either soon or relatively soon. You don't get wealthy by spending your own money, at least the principle.

At the same time, I want to reiterate, this is a really generous move, and OP should be held in high regard for making it happen. Everyone should do what they feel is best for themselves and their families.

I absolutely love the capital markets, have invested in all the momentum speculative investments as full disclosure.

Now I went to school for finance; therefore, all my classmates were WSB finances bros, and all my co-workers have also been WSB finance bros, lol.

While it is fun, and we discuss crazy market movements and strategies for fun, none of us would ever quit our day jobs.

Back in 2017 when /r/weedstocks were hitting 100% gains every other week, there were actually people who made a bank and quit their day jobs to trade this forever, same for /r/bitcoin back in early '18.

But all this does not last forever, sooner or later, speculative investments will come crashing down hard, like very very hard, and at the point, you better have a day job or you are screwed.

NotMyFriends,"I was looking through old Daily Discussion threads from the last bull market when we were going from $1k-$3k to see what the mood was like then. Here are some quotes from old threads:

**Comment 1:**

&gt; I'm selling my btc and it is hard as f**k!
&gt; 
&gt; Scaling out, last one will be sold at $3,300 USD
&gt; 
&gt; This is just a trading decision, risk v reward.
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody else doing the same?

**Comment 2:**

&gt;3 years ago I set a goal for myself to reach a net worth of 500k. I said to myself, when this happens, I will make big changes in my life, I will take the next step in my life, etc. I had all these vague ideas of what that meant.

&gt;I never knew it would happen so quickly. Yesterday, I woke up and my net worth was 500,265 thanks to bitcoin. Here I am, suddenly I have to make big decisions about my life and question who I am. It happened so suddenly. I pondered all day yesterday about this, what am I to do next?

&gt;Finally, I comforted myself: I will set my new goal to 600k and keep living as I am now so that I don't have to worry about it for at least a few months.

&gt; Today I woke up and my net worth was 650k. Fuck.

*Note: Based on today's price, if this person held eveything, their BTC portfolio would be ~$10M.*

**Comment 3:**

&gt; This is insane. Two weeks ago we were consolidating around $1400 and I was thinking we'd reached the top and it was time for a healthy correction.

&gt; Yet here we are, a full $1000 higher.

**Comment 4:**

&gt;i have my phone set to alert me every time there is an all time high. it was a really bad idea to do that. it kept vibrating and making an alarm sound all damn day.

**Comment 5:**

&gt;When I was first buying-in to BTC, I had an exit strategy planned ahead. Basically, selling 10% when we reached certain price points. I did that at $1200, which felt great because my average buy-in price was in the low $400s, so I tripled my money and still had 90% of my holdings riding.

&gt;Well, my next price point was something like $2300. And we've just blown through that overnight, and are knocking on $2400. So now I'm sitting here, looking at this enormously steep curve, wondering if I should even stick with my plan.

_SwanRonson__,"First of all, congratulations. Whatever people say it’s the results that matter and you got them. 

Let me tell you something. 25% is an amazing return. Let’s assume it was 100% due to the actions you took in some way. You should not change a thing if you agree with that assumption. More work/research/whatever does not equal better returns, and your returns are already stellar. I’d venture to say that the person with the highest return in the last decade is some guy who literally forgot he owned a bunch of bitcoin. Would he have made that return if he pored over crypto white papers all day? No, he would have done something dumb at some point. 

Basically what I’m saying is if it ain’t broke don’t fix it. Assuming you’re actually doing something right, keep doing that thing. Maybe your work acts as just enough of a filter that only really good ideas find their way to your hour a day of leisurely reading about investing, who knows. 

Putting on my big boy hat, you got real lucky, congrats. Take the life-changing gains out if you made them, let the rest ride, and for God’s sake if you decide you’re god’s gift to investing don’t bet the (whole) house on what you think is the next bitcoin.",gild554,2021-01-09 07:43:49,49

Natille,"Apart from Bitcoin, there are very few pure cryptocurrencies that simply want to serve as a means of payment. Most of the other cryptocurrencies instead see themselves as smart contracts platforms (Ethereum, EOS, Cardano, Tron …), represent a kind of share of a company (XRP, Binance Coin, Crypto.com Chain, Vechain) or pursue other goals (Tether, IOTA, …).

While the usual “pure currency” alternatives to Bitcoin $ BTC are relatively similar to Bitcoin, as they arise from a fork (Litecoin $ LTC, Bitcoin Cash $ BCH, …), a cryptocurrency called Nano has been enjoying great popularity for some time Reddit and Twitter social media. Some users are already trading NANO as the next bitcoin, as it made 265% in the past 7 days!

What is NANO?

Nano is a lightweight cryptocurrency that is designed to facilitate secure, practically instant payments, without fees, and addresses some of the major limitations of both legacy financial infrastructure and many modern cryptocurrencies.

It is a peer-to-peer platform that uses a unique block-lattice data structure to allow users to easily transfer value to one another without relying on centralized intermediaries.

Development of the project began in 2014 under the name RaiBlocks, and the coin (then termed XRB) launched the following year through a public faucet, which allowed users to claim small amounts of XRB after completing a captcha challenge. Users were allowed to complete as many captchas as they liked to increase their words — effectively trading their time and effort for XRB. RaiBlocks (XRB) was rebranded to Nano (NANO) in January 2018, with the new name chosen to better represent the speed and simplicity the project offers to users.

Nano vs. Bitcoin – the comparison

Technology: While Bitcoin is based on the blockchain technology we are all familiar with, Nano relies on the exotic block-lattice architecture. This causes some drastic changes in the characteristics of the two currencies.

Speed: Compared to Nano, Bitcoin is very slow. While Bitcoin transactions on the blockchain take on average significantly more than 10 minutes (to rule out a double-spend), nano transactions are completed in 0.18 – 1.5 seconds and thus even faster than Ripple. If you want to test the speed yourself, you can measure the speed here.

Similar speeds are only achieved with Bitcoin in the Lightning Network.

Transaction throughput: Bitcoin has to admit defeat here too. While Bitcoin only supports a maximum of 7 transactions per second with the current block size, the transaction throughput of Nano is basically unlimited, similar to IOTA. The transaction throughput is only limited by the hardware used. Bitcoin only delivered these effects on the Lightning Network.

Transaction costs: Due to the block-lattice, there are no transaction fees at Nano. With Bitcoin, there are basically no obligations to pay a transaction fee, but if you want to complete your Bitcoin transfer in a finite time, you can’t get around it for better or worse. Transaction fees of ~ $ 0.70 are currently common. At the peak of 2017, however, $ 20 bitcoin fees were necessary. Here, too, the Lightning Network for Bitcoin offers the only way out of the fee hell.

Inflation: Bitcoin is limited to a maximum of 21 million units. However, until this limit is reached in 2140, the number of Bitcoins will continue to increase. Should inflation flatten too much, Bitcoin could have problems ensuring network security. Nano, on the other hand, is limited to 133 million units. In contrast to Bitcoin, however, Nano is already completely distributed and there is no further inflation. Due to the Lattice block, this does not pose any problems for Nano, as no miners are required for network security.",ginibeu,2021-01-09 22:17:08,50

decibels42,"No offense, but if there was ever a time where ETH was NOT a short term project, it’s now.

As we all know, many people got attracted to BTC in 2020 because of its hardened monetary policy. 21M Bitcoin. Halvings every 4 years, etc. etc.

But in 2021 and 2022, ETH will get two upgrades that will give it a monetary policy that’s better than BTCs: (1) EIP 1559 and (2) deprivation of the POW rewards.

EIP 1559 is coming likely mid year and is a fee burning mechanism that will burn a portion of the gas fees in each transaction. So you can imagine the effect of this as the utility and value of Ethereum/DeFi/etc. goes up and people want to use it more. 

Getting rid of the POW rewards in favor of the POS rewards will alone result in a issuance rate drop from about 4.5% to 0.5%. This alone is incredible because its an issuance rate less than Bitcoin for about the next 12 years.

Then, when you factor in the fee burning effects, ETH’s issuance can go negative (something BTC can never do). Over the next year or so, we will start to see ETH being talked about as a competing digital SOV to BTC, and I believe its going to gain a significant amount of that market share.

That, or one of its many weaknesses becomes more apparent - the Chinese miners narrative picks up steam causing institutions to start dropping it, the immense energy waste associated with mining becomes indefendable in an ever more climate-conscious world, or the centralisation leaves only a few mining parties around meaning it becomes too centralised to be secure.

In my opinion, I think it's likely that Bitcoin will be overtaken in the long run. As to when that happens, I have no idea.

99% of altcoins/ICOs are scams and its difficult to evaluate them unless you know the history of these projects and are a programmer yourself so can evaluate their claims

Altcoins will come and go as we have always seen but bitcoin having a first mover advantage means that it is has the most network effect and best chance of surviving longterm 

One of the primary reasons Bitcoin was created was to have a sound monetary policy and digital scarcity , and being a multicoiner undermines all of this

Using wallets and software that supports multiple coins is confusing  and can lead to mistakes where you can lose money and makes the software far more insecure with a wider attack surface and potential for bugs and exploits 

When looking at the long term graphs , most altcoins pump and dump and lose value relative to Bitcoin. 

Getting involved with altcoins forces you to spend a ton of extra time learning complex and obscure projects 

Scammers prefer to target people that use altcoins as we saw with the ICO craze because Bitcoiners tend to have more experience and be more skeptical to evaluate their claims

Being involved in altcoins usually means you don't have long term time preferences and simply want to speculate short term which many people will consider a character flaw because you are more of a gambler 

Bitcoin has an uphill battle as is so any distractions weakens the possibility of it becoming a global p2p currency (Bitcoin is the best cryptocurrency that can achieve this with its network effect and roadmap)",gj6umrx,2021-01-14 12:17:21,77

katieleehaw,"This is a very in-depth article that I suggest people actually read.

"" According to their research, \[Nick\] Fuentes, a popular right-wing commentator who was suspended from YouTube last winter for violating its policies on hate speech, received the largest chunk of funding on Dec. 8 — about $250,000 in bitcoin. The Daily Stormer and the anti-immigration website VDARE were among the other recipients. 

Yahoo News reached out to the recipients named in this article to confirm whether they had received the funding, what information they had about the donor and what they planned on doing with the funds. None returned a request for comment, although Fuentes [tweeted an obscene gesture](https://twitter.com/NickJFuentes/status/1349626511079432194?s=20), naming several journalists, including this reporter, shortly after the inquiry was sent.

While the Daily Stormer website openly requests cryptocurrency donations, it also includes a disclaimer that says it is “opposed to violence” and that “anyone suggesting or promoting violence in the comments section will be immediately banned.”

While there’s no evidence that Fuentes directly participated in the Capitol riot, something he has so far denied, the financial resources of prominent right-wing actors are of growing interest to law enforcement.

**“I’d be stunned if both nation-state adversaries and terrorist organizations weren’t figuring out how to funnel money to these guys,” one former FBI official who reviewed the data for Yahoo News said. “Many of them use fundraising sites (often in Bitcoin) that are virtually unmonitored and unmonitorable. If they weren’t doing it, they’d be incompetent.”**

Additionally, much like conversations that took place on social media in the weeks leading up to the Capitol riot, the digital currency transactions are happening in plain sight. While cryptocurrency has the reputation of being anonymous and shadowy, that’s actually a common misconception, explained Maddie Kennedy, Chainalysis’s communications director. “With the right tools you can follow the money,” she said. “Cryptocurrency was designed to be transparent.”",gj997kb,2021-01-15 03:54:04,398
GonzoAndJohn,"tl;dr at the bottom. So in order to explain what mining is, you need to know the whole premise of what bitcoin is meant to represent. Bitcoin was designed as an implementation of blockchain, which is a buzzword that basically means ""We need a system to keep track of something (typically transactions, sales, purchases, etc.). We have to make sure everyone has a copy of this ledger, and that it's impossible to forge.""

Bitcoin came in as a ""proof of work"" system for verifying transactions. Basically, whenever someone buys or sells Bitcoin that they already own, they start a transaction: a problem is generated, and every computer that is involved with ""mining"" tries to solve it. It takes the form ""I'm thinking of a number that ends in 000000. Generate a random number that, when run through a hashing algorithm, ends in 000000."" The first computer on the network to solve this problem ""verifies"" the transaction. This attaches the transaction to the ledger, and for the ""proof of work"" that was done to verify it, the person who verified it gets some bitcoin.

Because every detail in this ledger has to line up and hashing is difficult, it's very very difficult to forge. If you wanted to change a transaction in the past (e.g. ""a week ago this guy gave me a million bitcoins, not just one""), or add your own (e.g. ""some guy just gave me a hundred dollars, I promise""), it would be nearly impossible to manipulate every transaction after that point to line up, since previous transactions factor into future ones, and if you want to update the ledger, you need to get more than half of the computers on the node to believe you. (Fun fact, if you owned more than half of the processing power that was currently mining any cryptocurrency, you could unilaterally do anything you wanted with all of it since you could just invent your own transactions and get more than half of the group to ""agree"" that it happened that way).

The key part of this is that hashing is difficult, that's the only reason crypto works. Technically speaking, an old pentium could get very lucky and randomly guess the solution to every transaction before anyone else, but graphics cards are very good at solving these types of problems, so miners tend to snatch them up for mining rigs. You can guess on the first try, or on the millionth try, but if you can guess a million times per second, chances are you'll verify a lot more transactions (and therefore get paid a lot more) than someone who can only guess a thousand times per second.

tldr: Mining crypto is the new version of being a notary and signing your name on other people's fancy sales. It's actually just the bank saying ""Guess what number I'm thinking of and I'll pay you for your time"" so you start guessing random numbers correctly so you can get paid a pittance. However, every so often these random numbers become harder to guess. The bank decides ""I've given too much bitcoin out recently just to notaries because everyone brought their random number generators so they could guess faster, so I'll make random guessing harder. Instead of between 1 and 10, now you have to guess between 1 and 1000."" As a result, the faster your computer can guess randomly, the more of a pittance you get paid, so miners buy new GPUs, work them half to death, and try to sell them for what they paid on Craigslist to unsuspecting people with words like ""Gently used"", ""never over 60% power"", but obviously not ""fan was running 24/7 for the last 8 months"" because miners lmao.",gj9bsqm,2021-01-15 04:13:38,105
Brawldud,"Bitcoin has always bewildered me. I started really paying attention to it around 2014 when it was at its low point after the failure of mtgox (~$200 or a bit below there). Never invested.

It's now up to an incredible amount, about ten times higher than what was then considered a fantasy of delusional proportions. There was at the time literally a whole copypasta of some bitcoiner's fantasy of waking up and seeing a $5K bitcoin price followed by spending their day doing various activities with bitcoin integrated into the process.

Bitcoiners got the first part (the $5K value and then some to boot) but never got the second part. In fact I still can't think of any compelling use cases for bitcoin that I wouldn't rather use venmo/apple pay/wechat pay for. The author pretty much says this too and points out it's entirely a speculative asset, but I mean, even gold can be used in engineering applications, so it's even more ""pure"" as speculative assets go.

Looking at this, Tesla, and the way that... literally the entire stock market behaved in 2020, I'm just absolutely convinced that much of peoples' investments are based on nothing but hype, and they're making complete bank off of it.

Have I gone crazy? Is this just the way the markets work now? Have they always worked this way?

flameylamey,"Haha, don't worry, you're not alone. Here's my entire (albeit condensed) crypto story:

Bought in to the market in late November 2017, initially 2/3 BTC and 1/3 LTC - with my entire savings that I spent the last 5 years accumulating.

After a few days of watching BTC rise while LTC stagnated, I decided ""Litecoin clearly isn't going anywhere"" and traded my Litecoin for Bitcoin.

Woke up the next morning, Litecoin was up something like 60%. It went approx 5x over the next week and would've become worth more than my BTC holdings.

Ended up buying in to Vertcoin, became persuaded by a bunch of Vertcoin believers. Became convinced that I was holding ""a proven product that has survived the test of time, with good fundamentals"" as I watched almost everything else moon around me. Made a few trades here and there, but only with the intention of increasing my Vertcoin stack. Spent almost the entirety of December 2017 all-in on Vertcoin. Watched several almost-breakouts that amounted to nothing. By the end, from memory it was the *only* coin in the top 100 that wasn't in the green over the course of the month of December.

Decided I'd go all in on XLM and was about to let it ride, but second guessed myself at the last minute and traded it all back for Vertcoin, as I thought it was ""due for a pump"" while XLM had already pumped a bit. XLM went up approximately 4-5x in sat value over the following week or so. Vertcoin... did not.

Saw a lot of hype surrounding TRX. Decided I was sick of watching all this stuff get shilled that was consistently mooning while I missed the boat, so I wasn't going to miss the boat this time. All in on TRX. (Believe it or not, sentiment was actually positive here around TRX at the time).

Rode TRX up about 20% right before the top - awesome, finally some gains! Saw the hype building around Vechain. Decided to go all in on Vechain. Second guessed myself at the last minute, went back to TRX. Vechain went 4x over the following 2 weeks. TRX... did not.

Took out two $20k loans on the way down throughout 2018, put it all in alts with potential.

Bear market ended up being much longer than I thought. In November 2018, I was something like 90%+ down and decided ""what more have I got to lose at this point? Might as well make some risky plays"". Decided to trade all my holdings back to BTC and try a series of longs on Bitmex. Turns out... the bottom was not quite in yet. Got liquidated, multiple times. Lost everything, including my loan money.

Spent the next 2 years making loan repayments equivalent to paying rent on a small apartment.

Bonus story: In March 2019, I had about $5k that I decided to put into BTC. I thought I'd have another go at leveraged trades on Bitmex. I put the $5k into a 7x leveraged long position on, when BTC was trading for $3950. I had this whole plan where I was going to just leave it for up to 6 months and see what happens. If it dropped and I got liquidated, oh well, it means the market probably isn't going to rise any time soon and I'd have time to buy lower. I'd already rationalised it to myself.

What did I do? you guessed it - less than a day later, at the last minute before I went to bed that night, I second guessed myself (again!) and decided to cancel the position. Woke up the next morning to see a massive surge in price, and... it just kept going. It ended up climbing from $3950 to almost $14,000 over the next 3 months. If I'd just left that position, I would've made it on that long alone. I worked it out at the time and if I'd just left it as I intended to, that $5k would've turned into something like $300k over a 2-3 month span, I would've had so much BTC. Can't even imagine what it would be worth now.

Man, it sounds so over-the-top when I type it out like that, haha. I *wish* I was making this shit up.

Where am I now? Well, while I was mostly living paycheck-to-paycheck while paying off my loan, I did get a bit of extra money from being picked for jury duty in March-June 2019. I served on a trial that went for ~10.5 weeks and ended up earning a nice sum of money to buy back into the market. Since that buy-in I'm up approximately 6x and have recovered around 70% of the total money I've put into the market, including everything I lost.

zeeper25,"[Trump began firing and replacing senior defense officials right after he lost the election.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/10/politics/pentagon-policy-official-resigns/index.html) With only two months left in his administration, why was he shaking up the Defense Department and stacking it with loyalists?

***Lack of preparation? Or planning for an insurrection?***

I believe Trump and his new appointees lowered our defenses so that the [coup attempt he would incite](https://youtu.be/nz-zWeqtVo8) would have a chance to succeed.

Pentagon staff [refused requests by the Mayor of D.C. to approve the use of National Guard Troops to help secure the Capitol on January 6th](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-protests-washington-guard-military/2021/01/07/c5299b56-510e-11eb-b2e8-3339e73d9da2_story.html).

Pentagon staff and [Capitol Police leadership](https://www.stripes.com/news/us/capitol-police-were-overrun-left-naked-against-rioters-1.658054) purposely limited the role of the National Guard. There was to be no activation of the National Guard to secure the Capitol as they had done months earlier during the BLM rallies.

[Capitol Police were also unprepared](https://www.businessinsider.com/capitol-police-officer-says-cops-sent-home-ahead-of-march-2021-1?utm_source=reddit.com), they were not fully staffed, they were not advised to bring gas masks, and were forbidden to don riot gear. ([Chief Sund has resigned, however he stated reports that Capitol Police refused the assistance of the National Guard were untrue](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/11/955548910/ex-capitol-police-chief-rebuffs-claims-national-guard-was-never-called-during-ri))

***Failure to respond:***

There was [inaction despite repeated requests](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/11/955548910/ex-capitol-police-chief-rebuffs-claims-national-guard-was-never-called-during-ri) (from the besieged Congress, from Pence, and from the Republican Governor of Maryland) for permission to send the Maryland National Guard into DC [to respond to the rioting as it unfolded](https://youtu.be/83wgYO2D7bU). *Apparently* [Trump watched the riots unfolding and was delighted](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/533403-sasse-says-trump-was-delighted-and-excited-by-reports-of-capitol-riot)*.*

***Martial Law:***

A riot evolving into hostage taking would have provided Trump with the excuse he needed to [impose martial law](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/12/22/martial-law-trump-flynn-history/), an idea that had been repeatedly floated by his adviser, disgraced ex-National Security Director Michael Flynn, whom Trump had just pardoned.

Unfortunately for the Trump conspirators, the rioters were held at bay long enough to stop the taking of hostages, and perhaps the deaths of Congressmen/Congresswomen and Mike Pence. 

One can assume that if Trump would have used the excuse that only he could maintain law and order, and that he would need to remain in charge indefinitely until law and order could be restored.

[Pence ultimately did an end run around Trump](https://news.yahoo.com/maryland-governor-tried-deploy-national-002546744.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAKsKE2PZ7wwKz9bc7ffqEg2AeWcJIFmKdM9KgWugACuS8DqQp5Vwv9kgpYcIDt3IGfyHT7C_W0JGxng6ACBpd2mqSTqP0DoAG5OxbhLqWJxe95ex6Qx57s4KpXF8q38JaEg8SrdnzFhBAGlgBYoLoTj_jtuBtJ7xVylkOi0HRrj) ([Pelosi and other Congressional leaders were also involved in this process](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/06/politics/pence-national-guard/index.html)) in order to provide the authorization needed for the Guard to arrive and secure the Capitol, stopping the insurrection.

**Aftermath:**

*We need a post-Trump 9/11 style commission to investigate this attempted insurrection. If Trump is complicit in planning an insurrection to remain in power he should be tried for treason*

As is, Trump's inaction after inciting the riot should lead to impeachment and removal from office, and any of the collaborators in the defense department who neutered the National Guard, and within the administration, and every rioter that attacked the Capitol Police need to be doxed and charged.

Apparently many rioters were off duty military, veterans or off duty police officers and fire fighters from distant states that [flashed their ID badges as they entered the Capitol](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/07/capitol-hill-riots-doj-456178).

[They all need to be identified](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/capitol-riots-virginia-police-officers-arrested/), arrested, and if they are currently serving in the military face a court martial, and if they are a current police officer or fire fighter terminated from those positions that require public trust to ensure public safety.

Senators and Congresspeople who either incited this riot and/or continued to attempt and stop the certification of the election after the attempted coup are complicit, and should also be removed from office.

This is based on their approval of a small number of Guardsmen to serve as traffic control (two shifts of 90 soldiers, 180 total), Metro assistance (two shifts of 24 soldiers, 48 total), administrative staff, and one small rapid response team of 40 soldiers. These soldiers were activated specifically for traffic control to help Trump rioters enter and exit D.C.

bitusher,"I would rather have higher degrees of privacy working on other layers like lightning, or sidechains(liquid CT) or wallets (Wasabi/payjoin) than the base layer because:

1)	The auditability of inflation and the 21 million limit is critical. All complex privacy crypto solutions may have undetectable bugs that lead to very difficult to detect inflation. With Bitcoin everyone can easily audit the chain. With certain privacy coins like monero their inflation resistance relies faith in the future of ECC security which might need to be upgraded in the future thus casting serious doubts on an inflation bug existing undetected.


2)	It is important to give users the option of transparency and audibility onchain, at least for accounts they choose to expose. 


3)	In the future privacy coins will be the first to be banned and liquidity is super critical. There are good reasons why most DNM txs are still using BTC

It is far more likely they outlaw or restrict privacy coins (because they choose to market themselves as a privacy coin onchain instead of just giving users the option of privacy on wallets and other layers) as you can see here

https://archive.is/ZMAbo

&gt;""Secretary of State Pompeo seems to confirm that the cryptocurrencies the federal government is watching most closely are privacy coins. If so, Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC), and others may soon be in some hot water if they are not banned altogether.""

We are already seeing this occur with new regulations in the US where they are proposing to KYC the withdrawal address which would mean that exchanges will be forced to drop support of ""privacy coins""

This is already occurring 

https://bittrexglobal.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018560640


4)	privacy tech like ring signatures, CT, and zk-snarks has huge scalability tradeoffs and much higher resource demands leading to more centralization and greater inefficiencies.

5) cross-input signature aggregation incentivizes more use of coinjoin by making  regular onchain transactions almost as small as regular transactions and lightning is designed to be extremely private from the get go. There is still an option to have transparency and give the allusion to regulators that they can track coins onchain however.

6) Coinjoin with a wallet is private enough, Look at what an employee of leading coinanalytics company says about coinjoin - 

Read this - 
https://removeddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/c4so58/i_am_a_current_or_former_employee_of_chainalysis/

&gt;Initially, the difficulty was standard mixers (still are) but now I would say Wassabi is enemy number one. **There is no way to de-anonymize it, and I don't see how the government can legally take Wassabi down, so it will probably persist.** Put it this way, if everyone used Wassabi, Chainalysis would go out of business.


note , this was anonymous leak so no way to verify comment came from actual former employee.

7)	Here is a presentation on how Taproot with signature aggregation can allow for UTXOs with untraceable swaps and indistinguishable payment channels. Taproot allows privacy txs to share the same anonymity set as regular onchain transactions thus eliminates the concerns with everyone forced to opt into a privacy Bitcoin wallet to have a larger anonymity set.
 
https://youtu.be/TYkIyUaRG0s?t=7592

8)	Privacy is a complex topic that has many nuances. Many privacy coins have lower tx fees(Bitcoin has lower tx fees on other layers) than Bitcoin onchain(mainly because they are hardly used and have low value) . Lower onchain tx fees can lead to the risk of very inexpensive attacks to deanonymize users as well. Bitcoin being designed where onchain fees will grow to cover the cost on security (and as explained privacy)  and inexpensive txs occur on other layers(that are very private like lightning which is multihop and onion routed by default which makes coin analytics practically impossible) is the better balanced solution IMHO.

9) payjoin is a new way to become very private onchain and reduce the UTXO set while doing so , its already in btcpay and bluewallet

Or it could have been stolen in one of the exchange scandals in the meantime. Or I could have lost my password. Or I could have sold “too soon” for a few hundred or thousand dollars in profit.

I honestly think one of those outcomes would have been more likely than actually making millions off of it.

In order to truly have done that, I would have needed to know what was going to happen with Bitcoin ahead of time and plan my behavior accordingly, and at that point I might as well just wish I’d known the correct numbers for the lottery.

To suppose that crypto is some kind of permanent digital gold that just continues to skyrocket in value, to me, is asking for trouble. IMO. Look at the actual history of gold. It didn't keep skyrocketing. In fact it has had several crashes, and once it got to $800-1000/oz or so, it sort of hit a ceiling. There seems to be a theoretical limit to how much people will pay for an oz of gold. 

There will be a limit to how much people will pay for a bitcoin too. The fact that we don't know what that limit is yet, doesn't matter. The limit will be hit. The more legitimacy the currency achieves, the closer we will get to the value limit. At that point the value will stabilize and it will stop being seen as some kind of gamblers rocketing asset class.

Bitcoin being the first crypto as a store of value, limited supply, etc. is critical in every portfolio. In a world of unlimited money printing bitcoin will continue to go up. (You're betting against the USD) Its my main bag as I see bitcoin going up insanely in pesos, quetzales, or bolivares, its only a matter of time before the dollar crashes more against bitcoin. 

Ethereum is the software of the world. Most of all other coins are built on top of Ethereum. As defi/derivates goes mainstream, ethereum will inevitably go up as well - as its the native currency on that network. And many more use cases are being developed on ethereum. 

Bitcoin might be valued at 36k or whatever but look at market cap. Its about 1 third of Amazon market cap (dollars invested in the asset). So relatively cheap compared to Amazon or Apple. Not to say ethereum is insanely cheap compared to them and its not even at all time highs yet.

If bitcoin is being compared to gold as a 10 trillion dollar asset in market cap, bitcoin is far superior as you can do more w it like wrap and use on ethereum.

dashby1,"  

Well well well… its been over a year since we have heard from our plucky friend Gator. He slipped into the Louisiana Bayou during the bear market with talk of pursuing studies in economics and international finance. He always was one of the smart ones around here. 

I was in my rocking chair on the back porch overlooking the swamp with a fist full of Apple Pie moonshine when what did I see waddling up my way? My ole’ friend Gator. 

“Been awhile pal” I exclaimed as he hoisted his now full-grown reptilian body up to my porch beside me. “How’s your crypto doing?” I asked jokingly. 

He winked and replied, “Right on track old friend. I have traveled far and wide in my studies and have even given a few key note speeches on decentralization and the emergence of digital assets. 

I see now more than ever signs that crypto is here to stay and that the speculation level is falling. ETH and BTC are still my only focus as a conservative gator.

The hedge against inflation, store of value and digital gold has taken a foothold for BTC among the biggest money managers in the world. Not my fav really, but this will underpin and legitimize the entire space. 

ETH has entered 2.0 in a near-flawless launch and continues to pile in staking deposits and a mind-boggling pace. The realization of what ETH will become is growing stronger by the day. 

I don’t mean to cut this visit short, but I am a busy gator and have more messages to spread across the land. I will say however that for this year to come, the stories will be supply shortage for Bitcoin and Layer 2 and DeFi for Ethereum.  

Good day my friend. Until we meet again.”

5boros,"Remove the ""instead of Ethereum or Polkadot"" from your way of expressing your position, and you can't go wrong. Even if ETH, or Polkadot have technical shortcomings, drawing attention to them isn't a good look, here's why.

Innocent indulgence in showing how Cardano is technically superior to chain-X, leads to the perception you're fudding other (more popular) projects, and you're toxic. People are naturally defensive of their current perspective. So, assuming you're the only, or first ""Cardano expert"" they're  engaging with, the person that's considering the advice you just gave them on Cardano will stop judging Cardano's pro's and con's, and start judging if your position on it is toxic if you appear to be fudding. People stop listening, and defend their current position in their minds when you mention how much better X is than Y. Instead, why not just talk about X.

This psychological  reaction has ruined more than one project. I mean look what happened to Bitcoin Cash, the only currency I can actually transact with now because of it's wide adoption, and low fee's. Their community's perceived toxicity, and zealotry by others in the crypto space  makes it a tough community to enjoy being a part of, regardless of the far superior tech. I mean try saying anything in that sub without getting downvoted. It's no wonder they crashed in relative price and never recovered. Same thing happened to EOS, great tech, but an unintentional toxicity in the community other's found repulsive, so nobody built anything there, they stuck with Ethereum.

A great deal of Ethereum's success may be due to the fact that you never heard anyone (that mattered) in the ETH community fudding Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Maximalist appeared terrified of it. The tech surrounding Ethereum generated enough curiosity to draw in developers and the rest is history.

Superior tech doesn't need to fudd the tech they're supposedly a great improvement over, it has the opposite effect the individuals, and communities that engage in it desire.

Debo37,"Hi all, while everyone's having fun (or not) riding the chop lately, I wanted to zoom out a bit and set up some perspective so we can understand what's going on in the long run. It helps to put the current price action in the context of the 4-year halving cycles - as it turns out, we're in a pretty interesting range that might have a lot of future significance for Bitcoin. Hopium follows.


***


Last cycle's absolute bottom was at around **$200 USD** during the second and third weeks of January, 2015. Last cycle's absolute top was at around **$19,000 USD** for essentially four days during the third week of December, 2017.

The bottom-to-top multiple for the 25 to 12.5 BTC halving cycle was therefore around **95x** for someone who hypothetically purchased the absolute low and sold the absolute high.

The current 12.5 to 6.25 BTC halving cycle has likely already put in its absolute bottom at around **$3,200 USD** for about four days during the third week of December, 2018.

If we assume that the bottom-to-top multiple is halved this cycle (in the spirit of halvings, of course), we can use a **47.5x** multiple from our absolute low to estimate an absolute high of **$152,000 USD**. Assuming our top for the 12.5 to 6.25 BTC cycle lands in that range, and assuming a typical 70-80% cycle correction, we'd be looking at an absolute bottom price of between **$30,400 USD** and **$45,600 USD** during the 6.25 to 3.125 BTC halving cycle. Current spot prices are right in the middle of this range, and all the chop you daytrader folks are riding might just be establishing our support level for the next macro cycle. A good, solid test of the $30k support would be extremely healthy for the long term and might help put in a floor for the next cycle crash in late 2022-early 2023. If your time horizon involves cashing out in the 2025 cycle, this could even be considered an excellent entry point.

This of course assumes that BTC prices are purely a function of BTC's supply inelasticity, and neglects all the market dynamics and narratives at play here though. I think there should be significant error bars to either side of the **$152,000 USD** number to reflect that - with a bigger error bar to the upside given the seemingly positive macro environment and a number of strong, favorable narratives, which I have listed below.


***


**Favorable market dynamics/narratives:**

* High inflation (due to interventionist monetary policy in the wake of COVID-19)
* A concurrent bull market in stocks
* Leading-edge institutional investment interest
* DeFi - decentralized finance
* Bitcoin as a ""store of value""

**Unfavorable market dynamics/narratives:**

* Government regulation and saber-rattling
* Solvency questions surrounding Tether, the crypto ecosystem's largest bank
* Blockchain scaling questions
* BTC's massive electricity consumption (framed in context of climate issues)
* Gold as a better ""store of value""

I foresee the gold vs. Bitcoin question arising at some point this cycle and becoming a permanent fixture of the narrative landscape for the long term. At current prices, gold has around a **~$10 trillion USD** market cap, compared to Bitcoin's **~$700 billion USD** market cap. Should Bitcoin rise to **~$54,000 USD**, its market cap will cross the vaunted trillion dollar mark, and I expect the Bitcoin vs. gold comparisons to go mainstream, as Bitcoin would be priced at roughly 10% the value of gold. I expect this to be one of the dominant financial narratives of the 2020s - is Bitcoin or gold a better deflationary asset in an age of inflation? I think the charts will tell us by the end of the decade, but gold is going to be Bitcoin's greatest adversary yet.

I think the goldbugs will laugh off Bitcoin's threat this cycle - BTC will probably peak somewhere between $100k and $250k, and then print its usual 70-80% cycle crash. But I think the 2025 cycle is going to be dominated by the gold comparisons. If the stock-to-flow model is a correct representation of reality, the next halving would make Bitcoin *more* valuable than gold, and the horse race would get very, very intense. If gold doesn't go down in 2025, it's doomed in 2029.


***


**TL;DR:** Halving last cycle's bottom-to-top multiple and multiplying it against this cycle's apparent bottom paints a price target for the 2021 cycle top in the mid-$100ks, with the potential to go higher than that if the macro environment continues to be favorable. Current price action might be setting a price floor for the next halving cycle by solidifying the $30k support, which appears to be a plausible ""bottom price"" for the 2021-2025 cycle.",gjvo591,2021-01-20 07:15:50,75
yazmataz_,"daily TA for the vefam:

short term: days, 

long term: weeks

VET/BTC

We broke &amp; held the 100D MA. At this point we'll start gathering momentum against bitcoin with a major upward movement with the 9 week MA. 

VET/ETH

Short term: vet is still trying to reverse the 20D MA and the 30D MA on the vet/eth chart. Yesterday we were rejected by the 3 day 9 MA.

Long term: vet/eth still hasn't even touched its 9 week MA.

VET/USDT

The 100H MA is in a major cup &amp; handle. Last time this cup &amp; handle formed the 100H MA went up 98%. 

Overall

We continue to see the last remaining resistance from vet/eth. We were rejected yesterday from the 3D 9 MA which held at .00002435. In order to get a push against eth we need to reverse the 10D, 20D, and 30D MAs. We believe this will come soon as the vet/usdt 100H MA will continue to push the price upward, and vet/btc has already reversed. We should have enough upward movement to reverse these major MAs against ETH. 

In general, we'd say get your popcorn ready. The upward movement of the vet/btc 9 week MA is very telling of whats to come. These last few resistances will break and we will start moving upward against both ETH &amp; BTC in the coming weeks.

We've put out all of our content &amp; charts on our twitter vetJTT if you're a visual person.

cryptOwOcurrency,"As far as I can tell, virtually all ethereum users, all ethereum developers, and all ethereum exchanges are united under the belief that 1559 improves user experience. The only people screaming ""this will hurt ethereum"" are the miners.

This kills the hard fork. Mark my words, a hard fork needs hodlers to be relevant. Who would hodl this thing? Basically ""Ethereum Classic 2"" is a boogeyman. It's not real because there's no practical way that it could possibly come together and pick up market share with real investors.

In contrast, Ethereum Classic and Bitcoin Cash succeeded in having a long-term market value because they made strong ideological stances that significant amounts of users agreed with.

When those forks happened, some percentage of actual hodlers looked at Ethereum and Ethereum Classic and said ""screw Ethereum they deviated from the plan, Ethereum Classic is the real ethereum."" Likewise, some amount of Bitcoin holders said ""screw Bitcoin they deviated from the plan, Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin.""

But minimum viable issuance has been cemented into Ethereum's social contract for years and years, longer than I can remember. Nobody could plausibly believe that the miner fork is ""the real ethereum"", unless they are paid to believe that (cough miners).

It's laughable that miners want to create a hard fork based on some weak inexplicable ideology, that will somehow have market value even though nobody will buy it. They really want to commit to mining on a valueless chain?

This tantrum that they're throwing is a delaying tactic, plain and simple. I still haven't heard one valid argument against 1559 that wasn't ""but it will reduce miner profitability"" or based on a misunderstanding of what 1559 actually does.

Change my view, the miners are a child who has been sucking on a lollipop all day, then starts crying as soon as the lollipop runs out. Miners are ""endless lollipopers"". They don't understand that lollipops are designed to dissolve over time in your mouth, that's just how lollipops work.

If you're a user/hodler and you have a good argument that the 1559 patch itself would be bad for the health of the ethereum protocol, I want to hear from you. I'm not convinced yet that you exist.

To everyone saying ""oh no, we better hold off now because this is cOnTeNtIoUs"", I ask: contentious among who? It's not contentious among users, it's not contentious among investors, it's not contentious among developers, and it's not contentious among exchanges. Read: failed hard fork.

Ethereum devs need to stick with their current plan, to address any REAL concerns everyone has with 1559, then ship it. This boogeyman wishy-washy shit will not fly in this community.

One last thought, the miners have no loyalty and haven't hesitated to ditch the Ethereum chain when the Ethereum Classic chain is more profitable. Why do we owe any loyalty to them?",gk0p12t,2021-01-21 11:38:29,85

_FirstTimeGrower_,"If the whole goal of upping the fuel prices was to impact the bitcoin farm and other money making methods in the hideout, why not implement a non static fuel usage that changes based on how many things are on in the hideout? For instance why should someone with a 1 gpu bitcoin farm and 1 craft going at all times have to pay the same amount as someone with a 50 gpu farm and crafts going on in every station 24/7?

Since the intended design is to have bitcoin linked to the real world pricing why does it also not come with the increased power usage that real life farms have to deal with? The fuel price has gone up approximately 4x for metal fuel tanks so why not just increase the fuel consumption up to 4x the speed depending on what is running? This would affect players that do not have much time to play much less while still allowing the nerf to still have its intended effect on players who are using the bitcoin farm to generate massive amounts of roubles.

AntiSky,"Yes.  Some are very rich ESPECIALLY these past few months.  If you use an app like ""Coinbase"" you change money into bitcoin.  Say you have $10.  You would buy .00000000000002 (making that number up but it would be very small fraction) in bitcoin.  Say Bitcoin then doubles its price from when you bought and you now have $20 but still .0000000000002.  You just turn it back into your currency again the same way you bought in.  Who buys it from you?  I do along with everyone else that buys it.  If you sell but nobody buys, the price drops because it has no value.  If everyone buys and nobody sells, it now has value and the price goes up.  The end game for some is to not have a ton of traditional currency (FIAT) but to have a ton of Bitcoin to trade.

My argument for Bitcoin:  Everything else is going digital and the world is getting VERY well connected.  Why still have ""exchange rates"" and why wouldn't money also go digital?  If you're young, sprinkle some dollars into it.  You might thank yourself later.  You don't have to own a whole Bitcoin... but read up on it and go from there.",gk5un4b,2021-01-22 19:10:14,164

otakucode,"I originally bought 10 bitcoins for a web-based game (that was still around last I checked, but I'd guess the creator is very, very rich) called MineThings.  The game itself was created as a sort of test of economic ideas through game mechanics, so bitcoin was a perfect match for it.  You could get temporary consumable perks and stuff.  Spend 4 or 5 btc on that, then just sat on the rest.  A few years later, its price was going up and up.  As it did, I sold off one coin at a time here and there when I thought surely it wouldn't go higher.  I sold my very last one for $2500 when I needed money really badly.

Essentially bitcoin 'mining' involves deriving a particular coin's serial number through an algorithm (this is an *incredibly* simplified explanation but the analogy is close enough).

oarabbus,"&gt; not your keys, not your bitcoin


While this is true, this is honestly bad advice to give newbies in the space, unless they are software engineers or generally technical.

99% of the population has 1000x the risk of losing all their Bitcoin by self-managing cold storage compared to leaving it on a US-based exchange.  I’d go as far as to say “not your keys not your Bitcoin use a cold wallet” is downright dangerous advice to give anyone who is *not* a crypto enthusiast and wants to make a first entry into the space.

It’s not 2017 Wild West with MtGox and all that shit. The risk of the Winklevoss twins or Brian Armstrong running away with your money is quite frankly minuscule. You can see their security protocols clearly detailed on their site. The risk of the “rogue engineer” stealing your Bitcoin in 2021 is not very far off the risk of the rogue Wells Fargo engineer clearing out your bank account.

If you’re technically savvy by all means use a hardware or offline wallet. If the terms hash, private key, and cold wallet mean little to you, do NOT use a cold wallet to store even a satoshi until you read up on it and you do.",gki5lli,2021-01-24 15:43:03,128

We both agree that on some level we both knew, that the hormones and pheromones were signaling us to make plans for the baby our conscious brains didn’t know about yet. And before we did the pregnancy test, we had already planned to move everything over.

If you weren't already in on this before it all went down, don't get in on it now. It won't hurt you to follow the whole situation closely, though. Maybe once you understand everything that's happening very well you can wait for your own time to strike, and just maybe make a bunch of money. 

Just not now. And definitely not if you're stupid enough to go ""lmaooooooooooo"" about things. 

It's gonna be kinda like Bitcoin, where if you were already holding a bunch of BTC from when it was cheap, the value explosion offered you some more opportunities to make money on top of the giant pile that just materialized. **B**ut if you tried to get your first BTC after it blew up and got all volatile, then you were most likely just going to lose a whole bunch of money while going through the stages of grief 4 times in a week.

I had student loans, credit card debt, rent due, no savings, no investments and thought it'd be great to pay down some of that.

I sold batches all the way up to $100, and then again sold more at $1k, then $10k, then $30k. I don't have any more BTC now.

However, I have no debt, a nice house, paid off car, and all those middle class american dream type things my parents never had. So for me, the utility of selling my bitcoin at the time was worth more than the possibility of having more wealth in the future.

I've also contributed to open source blockchain software, played with alt coins, built and dismantled mines, used FPGAs to prototype ASIC designs, and made some good friends along the way - also things I value.

You don't HAVE to buy a single WHOLE stock to have a stake in a company.  The same applies to cryptocurrency.

You can buy fractional portions of a stock.  You can literally buy $10 worth of Apple stock right now, it might seem silly, but you absolutely can.

You could buy $5 worth of bitcoin just the same.  There are things to consider regarding how you own it, exchange fees, transfer and such.  I'm offering no advice, but trying to aid in financial literacy, because it boggles my mind when I hear people talking about stocks like they can't possibly afford to get into it at all.

Robinhood, a very simple trading app, allows literally anyone to invest in the market and cryptocurrency, and other commodities as well.  

I'm no expert, but I can't believe how many times I've had to tell people that someone owning a little bitcoin doesn't mean they've got over $30k USD worth of BTC, nor does a person need thousands to invest in anything.  Decimals are a thing, you don't need whole values.

I've got like 0.10 GME right now.  I threw $10 into it on Tuesday for the heck of it. Might put in $100, nothing I'd be devastated to lose, but if I make a little something it's smarter than playing scratchers or powerball any day.",gl23pzy,2021-01-28 15:28:49,140

Ultimately a bunch of hedge fund guys will probably make a bunch of money on this but that doesn't fit the populist narrative being pushed.

Earthboom,"Answer:

Your own link gives you you the answer. Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency, like bitcoin, that was named after the doge meme. It doesn't do anything special other than being a meme that people bought into. Since its inception, the coin has tanked to hilarious levels although it enjoyed a brief time where it was actually semi valuable. Most coins that aren't bitcoin, called alt coins, rise and fall with bitcoin's success and failures, Dogecoin is no different but because it's a meme, it rises when people give it attention or when comedy becomes important and they need dogecoin to be the punchline. So it has some independence from bitcoin but it's not funny enough to trend independently of bitcoin. 

Recently, however, satoshistreetbets, a crypto currency Wallstreetbets type subreddit, decided to have some fun and coordinated a mass purchasing spree of Dogecoin presumably for the lulz. This was easy to do because the coin was worth garbage so a few bucks would get you thousands of dogecoins. This caught on because of the current trend happening with GME, and what started as a meme is now a legit bull run further fueled by the likes of Elon musk who has a habit of encouraging and going along with current internet pop culture trends targeted to a specific age and political group that I won't go into too much detail on here.

Now that it's making headlines, average people will hop on board the train for fear of missing out (FOMO), because it's pretty much free money at this point further fueling the run. All that being said, for safety and because we're talking about money, it's important to note this post shouldn't count as financial advise. The cryptocurrency scene is ripe with fraud and it's not regulated like Wallstreet is. Furthermore, it's prone to manipulation. As easy as this purchasing spree is happening, so too can a mass sell off be triggered overnight by ""whales"" (people with insane amounts of dogecoin). Unless you really understand basic economics and are attentive to the market trends 24/7, you could easily be left holding the bag or have your coins stolen if you didn't research the right exchange, or any numerous things people have done in the past that boggle the mind. Worst case, you aren't allowed to sell because the exchange you're on is shady and took part in the price manipulation in the first place, or they don't have enough funds to pay you and everyone else out.

In short, lots can happen here unlike with the GME stuff.

My guess is dogecoin will keep ballooning so long as the meme is kept alive and keeps garnering attention until someone big cashes out which will cause a massive panic and it'll tank down to nothing again. This could be done by reddit themselves, Elon, the media reporting some negative press, China, India, the federal government, AOC, literally anything. It's that finicky and volatile.

CarelessMiddleFinger,"The more people buy Dogecoin the higher the crypto goes, this is the idea of the free market where we the individual investors can come together to make something out of nothing. the idea is to have it skyrocket such as bitcoin did.

Dogecoin has a lot more traction than the crypto price right now is leading you to believe. Dogecoin hasn't shot up as quick as GME because brokers doubled down after the GME surge and limited crypto buying power to money that has already cleared instead of trading on margin (which they disguise as ""instant credit"").

By them doing this, it makes you question wether this is a hoax or the next surge and will cause people to sell out of fear. There are countless amount of people right now just waiting for their funds to post on the broker accounts so that they can buy in. If those of us who are in, hold the line without fear and people continue to purchase once their funds clear, Doge can easily become the next big surge. 

When it does, you should be able to pull some out with profits and still keep much in, so it will continue to grow. If you pull out too early or too much, it won't work as intended and she won't as satisfying as the girl who never got a nut because your nut came too fast.

Krakanu,"Satoshi Nakamoto is the creator of bitcoin.  Although it's widely agreed that is just a made up name.  It is unclear who the actual creator is. 

Bitcoin has value because others will agree to trade it with you in exchange for goods and services (or other currencies).  It takes a lot of work (made up work, but still work nonetheless) to make new bitcoins via mining.

At first bitcoin was worth literally nothing which is why you hear stories of people losing their early bitcoin stashes because back then not everyone thought they had any value.  It took time for people to trust the system and for the value to ramp up to where it is today.  The value changes a lot because people's opinions of the true value of a bitcoin swing wildly (and it is still unclear what the opinion is of the public/major governments).  Personally, I believe bitcoin has value because it allows you to relatively  easily transfer value to anyone anywhere in the world without any government or corporation being involved in the process.

Ultimately, bitcoin is just a piece of software that creates digital tokens that cannot be duplicated or double spent.  You can't just say ""I have 10 bitcoin"". You have to prove it by showing where it came from.  Every bitcoin can be traced from its current location (someone's digital wallet) all the way back to the original block it was mined from.  This information is contained within the blockchain for bitcoin, which is a master record of all bitcoin transactions ever made and all bitcoin ever mined.",glgoans,2021-01-31 17:29:58,70

Stuff like: Bob lends Jerry 1 bitcoin, Jerry pays Bob interest. Kind of like what banks do. Except this is all done automatically.

For people like most of us in this sub, understanding the technology of BTC outweighs any doubt of using Bitcoin every day. 

But for most people in the world, (like late adopters of any technology) the idea of a cold wallet and buying on exchanges and all that is still a HUGE barrier to entry in this space. 

My gf recently expressed an interest in purchasing some Bitcoin. When I explained some of the beginning steps and how you should eventually move into a hardware wallet and such, her eyes glazed over and she wasn’t comfortable taking that step yet.

Dogecoin is worse than a bank. There's a small group of people who run dogecoin and they up the capacity whenever it serves them, which is all the time. And there's no laws prohibiting their monetary abuse.

Adventurous_Piglet85,"This comment is where it’s at. It’s not mine but it follows the same thought process I do. Not my personal comment but this is from someone who understands.

Thank you for spreading awareness, people!

There are a lot of so called financial experts on reddit and youtube spreading bullshit about the supply cap of Dogecoin and calling it a worthless memecoin.

Yes, Dogecoin has a supply growth of about 5 billion coins (that's about 4-5% right now) per year, but why is that a problem? The growth is there to keep transaction fees to a minimum.

Dogecoin doesn't need a supply limit like Bitcoin, because in the long run it will be much easier to exchange Dogecoin for goods and services, than with other crypto currencies or regular currencies for that matter.

If Bitcoin wants to become a real global currency with buying power, not just a speculation tool to exchange it for a few thousand debt based USD when it hits a new record high every few months or years, it's supply will have to grow inevitably.

We have to see the bigger picture! Dogecoin will climb to a dollar, but why sell there? We could build a new, fair, balanced monetary system with Dogecoin, not to make a quick profit, but to change the whole world.

Our money is backed by signatures on debt contracts, not on real values. But it works, because we believe in it, even if it will be our downfall if it continues like this.

""You're stupid if you buy Dogecoin, it has no value, it has unlimited supply."" Yeah right, but your fucking US dollar, which is created out of thin air, is backed by debt and is inflating to endlessness, has value? It has a limited supply?  Please, think about that for a few minutes!

Dogecoin has not an unlimited supply in the sense that the supply could grow 10x from one moment to another, devaluing your Dogecoins by a 1000% in an instant, which could happen to any ""normal"" currency and is happening right now to the USD. That's just not possible, because of the way mining Dogecoin works. It has a fixed number of new units every year, so if the value of 1 unit goes up, the percentage of inflation goes down. People need to understand this.

Dogecoin has the possibility to change our perception on money and what money stands for. It can't be backed by signatures on a debt contract, it has to be backed by real goods and services.

It shouldn't be a tool to make a quick buck of when you see the green candle skyrocketing. Dogecoin needs to be more than that. Yes, sell some of it when it hits a dollar, but stay in it for the long run.

Understand and spread awareness of the fact that our current money is valueless, but we all agree with the illusion that it ""works"", so it's still ""valuable"" in the sense that we use it everyday to buy goods and services.

We could apply that same illusion to Dogecoin, but here it would be different, because it's not backed by debt, like the USD is. It would be backed by real values and our trust in it.

Please share the truth and let people know!k",gliwkbi,2021-02-01 06:53:22,889

There were people talking about a *point* to Bitcoin aside from just something that was going to spike up in value. 

Almost all I see on this sub is to the moon shit and everyone obsessing over getting rich with Doge, and at that point people are just shilling a pyramid scheme. Yeah it's great for everyone who, like me, bought in at under a cent if the price ends up at $1 or $10, but who the hell is going to be buying at $10? Why are they going to be buying at $10? Because they're hoping it'll get to $100, or because there's a tangible reason to own Doge other than trying to cash in later on?

If people can't give good answers to why Doge is going to have actual longevity and could replace other cryptos like Ethereum or Bitcoin (or any of the other 10 currencies with a higher market cap), then all of this is just a pyramid scheme where early adopters make loads, middle adopters make a bit, and late adopters get left covering the bill once the bubble bursts.",glsua60,2021-02-03 09:06:08,90

bitusher,"Bitcoin has gone through many bear and bull markets throughout the years and periods of rapid appreciation followed by a large correction or a bubble. 

This is primarily fueled by More buyers than sellers and Bitcoins disinflationary supply 

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply

The three last bubbles(of many) in Bitcoin are :

**Early 2013 Bubble** A 2 month bull market creep from 20 USD a BTC to 90 USD a BTC before the bubble sets in and the price skyrockets to ~270 usd and than corrects to an average support ~110 USD 

**Late 2013 Bubble** A very slow bull market lasting 6 months bringing the price from ~110 to 290 USD and than skyrocketing up to ~1200 , to than correct to a 800 support declining into a bear market

**2017** - Strong Bull market for 11 months this year bringing bitcoin from ~1k USD to 4.5K USD  followed by a bubble in late November pushing Bitcoin to almost 20k USD a Bitcoin than correcting to a support of ~14k declining in a bear market. 

Note -Bitcoin only remained above 18k that year for 3 days 

This year looks more similar to the 2017 bull market with a long bull market leading to what might be another bubble in early to mid 2021

The supply shock from the last halvening this year on may 11, 2020 is setting in, coupled by institutional investors is really driving this bull market. Eventually I expect a very large correction but I think the ""bubble"" hasn't even really started and we are still in the ""slow"" build up. Notice the July 9, 2016 havening was what had a large impact on the bull market in 2017 and how delayed the impacts of this scarcity takes before the ""bubble"" occurs. This in part is why some like myself see the next bubble occurring mid 2021 with a ""slow"" lead up.... but **you shouldn't trust my or anyone elses ""price predictions""**


The correction typically occurs because their is irrational exuberance/FOMO(fear of missing out) that cannot be sustained and people start taking profits causing panic selling and settling on a corrected support which usually will lead into a bear market


Supply and demand is key and a supply shock creates a vicious cycle of more demand until a new ATH is reached and we fall into another bear cycle. This will likely change in the future when inflation is very low and Bitcoin is less volatile but for now I expect several more years of volatility

The main reasons for the return of the bull market in 2020 are the following

1) The may 11, 2020 halvening created a supply shock where the amount of mined Bitcoin dropped from 12.5 BTC per block inflation to 6.25 BTC block inflation . As you can see with the 6 month delay in the July 9, 2016 halvening creating the 2017 bull market this scarcity takes time to set in which would indicate we are just at the start of the bull market

2) New institutional investors from square, MicroStrategy , MassMutual hedging part of their portfolio in Bitcoin

https://bitcointreasuries.org/

3) Fear of higher taxes due to economic stimulus packages and over spending causing capital flight into bitcoin to avoid taxes and inflation

4) More adoption from retail investors and liquidity options to invest in bitcoin",glvcpnl,2021-02-04 00:32:09,30

[Debunking ""Blockchain not Bitcoin""](https://youtu.be/r2f0HlaRdgo)

TO GET STARTED, you need to buy some bitcoin from a Bitcoin exchange. For beginners, I recommend the Cash App for its 2% purchase fees and free withdrawals. Once you buy Bitcoin, withdraw it to a non custodial Bitcoin wallet. This is a wallet where you control the private keys that control your Bitcoin. Don't leave your Bitcoin on an exchange. 

Not your keys, not your coins. Bitcoin is the freedom from needing banks and governments to transfer digital money. Do not use a custodial Bitcoin wallet. Don't put your Bitcoin into someone else's hands. Hold it yourself in a non custodial wallet. Always withdraw your Bitcoin from the exchange where you bought it.
 
I recommend using [Mycelium Bitcoin wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet) for Android.

Make sure to write down your 12 word restore phrase. It can restore your Bitcoin on any device. So keep it safe and secure. No pictures. No typing into a file. Pen and paper only. This phrase essentially IS your Bitcoin because control of your money is unlocked with it. 

Never sell your Bitcoin. Just spend it when you want to take profit. Selling Bitcoin on exchanges lowers the price per Bitcoin. So just spend it directly like how it's supposed to work.

[Purse.io](https://Purse.io) - Buy anything from Amazon using Bitcoin and name your own discount from 5-30%.

[List of stores that accept Bitcoin](https://www.acceptedhere.io/)

When spending or transferring your Bitcoin, there's a transaction fee. (The fee goes to the Bitcoin miner who mines the block that contains that transaction). 

Check https://mempool.space/ to see how low to set your transaction fee. You'll set the transaction fee when sending a payment from your Bitcoin wallet. Some wallets don't offer this option. Don't use those wallets.

And finally, a warning from Jameson Lopp. ""Every bitcoin that is held by an institution is a bitcoin that has had its security weakened by being subjected to bureaucratic and political decision-making. “Not your keys, not your bitcoin” rings true because when you have to ask someone for permission to transact, you are no longer in a position to resist censorship. Bitcoin owners must not trust third parties to act in their best interest!""

Hold your own Bitcoin. Don't let anyone trick you into giving them your Bitcoin. All of those schemes are Ponzi schemes. Nobody is going to give you interest on your Bitcoin, and if they do, they're paying you in a worthless, flawed token. Or they are doing accounting shenanigans that Bitcoin already solved. They will all collapse, and people with think they lost their Bitcoin, when in reality the Bitcoin was lost as soon as you deposited it into the Ponzi scheme. 

Not your keys, not your coins.",glvox6f,2021-02-04 01:55:47,186

Which is not to say Satoshi wasn’t a genius. But he could never have dreamed of how things would turn out. If he had, he wouldn’t have crippled BTC, and it would have looked a lot like Doge instead.

Alexx5,"&gt;A node is one of the main things that keeps the block chain secure from malicious actors.

No it isn't. It's a common misconception that running is node is somehow a good thing to do for the health and security of the network. The only thing that truly matter is the hash power of the miners. Your full node can do jack shit against an attack if you aren't mining. All you can do is observe.

Having said that, I agree that it's important that the ability to run a node is available to as many people as possible. But running a node is something you do for yourself, not for others. Mining pools, people running services that use the Bitcoin blockchain, and businesses (and sometimes individuals) that deal with very large Bitcoin amounts are the only ones that should run their own nodes.

aminok,"&gt;I'm new to crypto but I do know about it having an open protocol that is meant to transfer cryptocurrencies to different blockchains. 

Yes, so to further elaborate on that, they have a network of users, that run REN darknodes. Each needs to put up 100,000 REN token as collateral to be able to run a darknode.

These nodes collectively generate a private key, and then create a public deposit address for a blockchain, say Bitcoin, and accept BTC deposits to that address.

The nodes also control an address on Ethereum, that accepts ERC20 token deposits.

When users deposit cryptocurrency to the public address on the other blockchain, the REN darknodes automatically issue ERC20 tokens to that user's address on the Ethereum blockchain, and these ERC20 tokens are 'backed' by the cryptocurrency that being kept in the collectively controlled address on the other blockchain.

When a user send their ERC20 tokens back to the REN-controlled Ethereum address, the REN darknodes will collectively sign a transaction, using multi-party computation, to send cryptocurrency from the address holding the collateral that is backing the ERC20 tokens, to the user's cryptocurrency address.",gmjl38b,2021-02-08 12:20:54,1

j_ockeghem,"This morning, before the Tesla news, I wrote that the increasing news of institutional adoption feel like the slow, initial onset of an avalanche:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/lf4ies/daily\_discussion\_monday\_february\_08\_2021/gmknt0e?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/lf4ies/daily_discussion_monday_february_08_2021/gmknt0e?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

In my opinion, the Tesla news that then followed on this historic day has to be considered the adoption singularity. There is no way back from here. We have crossed the Rubicon. I expect the price to adjust much faster to this entirely new situation of large corporations using bitcoin as reserve asset (and when will the first cities or nations follow?) than I had anticipated before. 

A word of warning: Selling here in the thinking ""it has to correct soon and I can buy back lower"" is an almost 100% sure way of ending up with less BTC than before. It's fine to take USD profits of course, but be aware that the market will manage to use almost any action of yours as a way to decrease your bitcoin holdings. Sure there will be corrections, but with this ""perfect storm"" (which includes also economic macro-environment, inflation fears, a whole new generation driven to digital assets in lockdown, rapid digital transformation of all sectors, increased by the coronavirus crisis) IMO there is no way that 50k is anywhere close to a mid- or even long-term top.",gmn5bl1,2021-02-09 09:21:42,37

Most people seem to underestimate the gravity of completely *feeless* compared to *almost no fees.* In everyday transactions, nobody ever would come up with the idea of tossing 1c in a jar every time we hand somebody a 10$ bill. In crypto we accept it, because it is the common status quo.

It really is like this: 

fee-less  &gt;&gt;&gt;  tiny fees  &gt;  fees

There are many reasons that speak for Nano and make it an incredibly powerful network in the upcoming economy. Payments are the first and most obvious use-case for DLTs, that's why the proof-of-concept of permissionless Blockchains, Bitcoin, was orginally intended to be a P2P cash system as well. Money is an information system, and decentralizing it closes the trust-gap.

Furthermore, **Global transactions** will only become more in volume, and more common for regular people. The same holds true for **Micro transactions** as our economy will shift more towards pay2rent and pay2use services (especially online). The capability to quickly transfer value for free, and the economy that can be built on top of this is still out of grasp for most of us.

Imagine for example gaming. Instead of charging any particular accounts (steam, xbox live, fortnite) you just transfer quickly and uncomplicated out of your own wallet. No need for an individual account with any of these, no need for an in-game currency. No need for any intermediary. And that's just one possible usecase among literally thousands.

Additionally comes, that Nano doesn't compete with DeFi (Finanical Services), Smart Contract platforms or any other, more elaborate use-cases. It can and will blissfully coexist with ETH, ADA, IOTA, VET and other elaborate DLTs.

It revolutionizes the **""payments-industry""**, nothing besides that. No extra layers, no complications, ""do one thing and do it well"", and that is Nano's design philosophy. Payments affect almost every single person almost every single day. Nano really is the Internet of payments, but with in-built egalitarian, non-discriminative, sustainable, qualities on the protocol level.

And to everybody saying I am shilling Nano: I am not talking good about Nano because I am financially invested. I am financially invested because i can only talk good about Nano.

The idea of not pushing all transactions onto one blockchain, and instead build an ever-expanding **grid of theoretically infinite intertwined blockchains**, is fucking genius. It's absolutely superb design. Even non-fans that love technology must appreciate this.

I believe most of us cannot even remotely grasp yet the full potential of a fee-less (not super cheap!), decentralized payments network. And for those that do, Nano is the way.",gmss0dp,2021-02-10 18:03:49,16

dhork,"While every Bitcoin holder is welcoming the increase in price, right now, I feel like it's bad for the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole. The difficulty of Bitcoin mining increases with the number of people doing it. Blocks are mined about every 10 minutes. There is a block reward of 6.25 BTC per block mined.... But with BTC now over $40k, that means that every block found rewards it's finder with $250k. Every 10 minutes. It's as if Tesla decided to release 300 new shares every 10 minutes, yet still the price goes up!

So since miners essentially turn electricity into blocks, this high block reward incentives miners to use as much cheap electricity as they can. Bitcoin's energy footprint is directly related to it's price (and the block reward). As long as price goes up, so does it's energy footprint.

If there's a silver lining, it's that the protocol developers designed the reward to decrease over time and eventually be eliminated. The block reward is halved (roughly) every 4 years, so in 20 years the block reward will be a shade under .2 BTC. For the block rewards to be equivalent to right now, BTC would have to be worth $1.25 million by then. Seems unlikely, but back in 2012 when I first started getting into it BTC at $40k seemed unlikely, too.",gmtxuti,2021-02-11 01:28:41,879

The other 2.5 million will be created as block rewards between now and the point where the reward goes away.

It hardly works as a commodity either because commodities have actual use. When you buy a commodity it's with the intent to use it. When you invest in a commodity it's a way to bet on how many people will want to buy it with the intent to use. That's the problem I see with bitcoin. All these people are buying because they are hoping someone in the future comes along and starts using it in a large and serious manner. But it will never be adopted by governments because of the above reason, plus the whole not having control of their own money thing. 

Eventually this will be realized in mass and when it does I full expect bitcoin to crash.

Red4141,"From a crypto firm...

The great thing about DeFi is that it’s global, has relatively low fees (once Ethereum scales), few intermediaries, transparent fair rules for everyone, and the trade is the settlement. It gets rid of the rigged system and replaces it with a shared public infrastructure that cannot be rigged. No broker can ratchet up collateral requirements because there is no gatekeeper broker. The clearinghouse is just a smart contract. Since everything is automated and happens via smart contracts, a trade either happens or it doesn’t. There is not + 2 days, but instead “trade intent” + 30 seconds. Once your trade gets confirmed on Ethereum, it’s final, and that’s it. And since these systems are global, anyone can access them anywhere in the world; it just takes a smartphone or computer and some cryptocurrency. The advent of DeFi mitigates the main problems and rigged parts of the system these Redditors were frustrated with.  


When you use DeFi, you’ll realize finance is never going back. The moment I internalized that this was for sure the way the future is going was in 2020. This may surprise some people, given that I’ve been building in the DeFi space since 2014. But I was 90% confident for a very long time, and it wasn’t until last year when I became 99.9% convinced that DeFi is the future of finance. I wanted to trade from one asset into another. I had one cryptocurrency that was a token on Ethereum. I needed dollars to send to an OTC desk to get me a cryptocurrency from an exchange that didn’t trade in the US market. I used a decentralized exchange aggregator (a site that routes your order across dozens of decentralized token exchanges and gets you the best price) and traded that first token for USDC. The price I got was better than any OTC desk quoted me for the same trade. Ordinarily, I would've had to send it to a centralized exchange first, wait a while, trade it, and withdraw the USDC, which usually retakes a bit. Once I had the USDC, I sent the USDC to an OTC desk (at about 2 AM, when the banking system would’ve been closed). The OTC desk bought me the new token and then sent it to my wallet for that blockchain a few hours later.  


So what just happened there is insanely cool. I’d have to sell the initial position in traditional finance, withdraw dollars after waiting for settlement, and wait for the wire to process (so three days so far). Then the foreign OTC desk could buy me the asset I needed. And I’d probably pay a fair amount of fees along the way too. And I certainly couldn’t have done it at 2 AM because nothing would’ve been open (neither my bank nor the market). Crypto markets trade 24/7.  


Just the other night, I was getting indicative quotes on a 1000 ETH trade, and decentralized exchange aggregators offered lower slippage than Coinbase Prime. This feels like a watershed moment for the DeFi space. Not only is it a better system in theory, but it is also actually starting to become more useful to crypto users than other centralized systems. Companies like Coinbase will always help onboarding users to crypto from fiat/USD. Still, for crypto to crypto and stable coins &lt;&gt; crypto, DEXes will begin to dominate. Ethereum is the asset at the forefront of all of this. Even after its recent run-up, it still trades at a P/S ratio of 40x, which will become earnings for ETH stakers when value switches to Ethereum 2.0. Revenue on Ethereum has grown over 400x since January 2020. It’s an insanely cheap asset compared to anything else in the public markets with that kind of growth relative to its revenue multiple. It’s not entirely crazy to see Ethereum being able to 5-10x from here, especially when compared to traditional equities markets. Ethereum is the base layer of this new open financial system. The vast majority of the value in that system is transacting on top of smart contracts written on Ethereum. The net present value of the global settlement layer's transaction fees for all of finance is a considerable number. We have positioned the Pantera Liquid Token Fund around the opportunities surrounding decentralized finance and the Ethereum ecosystem for all the reasons above. 

 The fund was up 98% in January versus BTC up 15%. We think that similar to the last cycle, Bitcoin dominance (BTC’s percent of overall market cap in the space) will eventually go down into the forties again. In our view, the primary beneficiaries are likely to be Ethereum and Ethereum based decentralized finance assets, as well as eventually DeFi assets on other chains like Polkadot later in the year. This outperformance so far has mainly been due to our positioning surrounding DeFi (and some due to catching an opportune time to take some risk off after BTC hit $40k). These significant innovations we talked about above are only \*4%\* of the total cryptocurrency market cap. By the end of this cycle, we think they could potentially be 20%, or a relative outperformance of 5x.",gmyt99z,2021-02-12 03:29:21,25

So why is ethereum more valuable than bitcoin?

Bitcoin is valuable because it's a hedge against inflation. There is a hard cap of 21 million bitcoin. The issuance that bitcoin miners received is cut in half every 4 years, making bitcoin rely on transaction fees more and makes bitcoins monetary policy stronger.

Ethereum decided to solve a problem with determining an appropriate gas price and ended up creating eip-1559 which when combined with the merger (fully pos ethereum), it will likely make ethereum have a slightly deflationary supply.

Ethereum will get better gas pricing estimates, variable sized blocks to handle congestion, and a better monetary policy from eip-1559.

DeFi is the _killer_ feature of ethereum and DeFi has been exploding the last few weeks due to the gme incident. DeFi is just going to get better with zero knowledge rollups and even better when sharding is ready. 

Ethereum is just getting started, wait around and find out!

Not day trading. Not short selling. Not pump and dumping.

Just buying and holding.

Please hear me out. Even if you still decide to day trade or go nuts with XRP or whatever, please still do what's written below in addition.

You're in the right place.

Crypto is still in early days, relatively.

Get in now. Buy a bit each week or month and just hold on to it. I recommend BTC as your backbone (50% or more of your portfolio).

Use it as a emergency account. Don't touch it unless you need it for dire purposes.

Get a hardware wallet. I like Ledger Nano S. Get your crypto off the exchange and onto your hardware wallet.

Put the hardware wallet away and make sure to keep your account recovery phrase (a set of 24 words in a certain order that is the keys to your account) safe and never digital. Only analog.

You will make a bunch of money.

If you're overwhelmed by this, read The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous or a Crypto Basics article from a reputable source.

**(consolidated/paraphrased from various amazing contributors)**

* Ethereum does much more than Bitcoin (not trashing papa Bitcoin, but Ethereum does more. Much Much more). The lack of innovation in Bitcoin may not be bad. Being more conservative, less innovative, has perks. There's plenty of discussion on this theme I'll mention below.
* Ethereum's network effects as the dominant smart contract platform are overwhelming. All the things that make smart-blockchains cool are being done on Ethereum. There's no serious competition anymore; the evidence overwhelming:
   * Ethereum's momentum as the primary platform where crypto-assets are issued has grown over the last three years, with the share of the total token market cap constituted by Ethereum based tokens rising from 73.81% in July 2017, to 98.40% in July 2020 [(source)](https://medium.com/@amincad/ethereum-achieves-absolute-dominance-of-token-market-f7ef9c26ede). The entire market has steadily converged on Ethereum as the settlement layer for crypto-assets and Ethereum's ERC20 token interface as its technology standard for digital assets.
   * Ethereum is the most utilized crypto platform in the world, with more fees being paid to Ethereum miners than any other project's. The dominance extends beyond just Ethereum, to Ethereum-based dApps, with seven of the next nine largest revenue earning crypto projects in the world being based on Ethereum, as this charts shows with all the projects highlighted in pink being Ethereum-based: [https://cryptofees.info](https://cryptofees.info)
   * All major DeFi applications operate on Ethereum. [Tracked by DefiPulse](https://defipulse.com/). These DeFi apps are all interacting to create an increasingly sophisticated open financial system on Ethereum that gives the platform an increasingly insurmountable advantage over potential competitors.
   * All of the major stablecoins; Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), True USD (TUSD), Binance USD (BUSD), and Paxos Standard (PAX), use the ERC20 standard.
* Beyond market adoption, the Ethereum development community is by far the largest in the cryptocurrency space, and its advantage over all other smart contract platforms has rapidly grown over the last three years:
   * Ethereum has an overwhelming lead over all other cryptocurrency and blockchain projects in the number of developers working on it according to the recently released [Electric Capital Developer Report (2020)](https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2020-9417165c6444). This lead is accelerating, with a 215% increase in the number of developers working on Ethereum since 2017, and with the number of monthly developers increasing by 300+ between Q3 2019 and Q3 2020, which bucked the downward trend seen in the rest of the cryptocurrency market. [(source)](https://i.imgur.com/Hfo9rTP.jpg)
   * The overwhelming majority of Research and Development on blockchain scalability is being done on Ethereum-based projects [(source)](https://github.com/Awesome-Layer-2/awesome-layer-2). Groundbreaking scalability solutions that have recently launched on Ethereum Mainnet include Loopring and zkSync, which use zkRollUp technology to enable thousands of transactions per second to be processed on Ethereum layer 1: [(source)](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-pay-is-live-zkrollup-transfers-on-ethereum-770d35213408) The misinformation you'll hear too much
   * Ethereum's [developer tool list](https://github.com/ConsenSys/ethereum-developer-tools-list) outshines everything out there. Getting smart contract to work properly is complex, and there is no magic port that will can do that realistically (no matter what others might shill). These are years of tools from thousands of developers. Having smart contract functionality means little compared to the tool list needed to use it effectively.
   * Every other project still needs years to have all these tools, for what? A blockchain that has some trivial perk (assuming it's a perk). By the time they have these tools (years away) ETH 2.0 and a whole new paradigm of functionally will be in place. [Again, there are thousands and thousand of ethereum developers, no other project comes close.](https://i.imgur.com/Hfo9rTP.jpg)
   * Note, there's some that think moving tokens (ERC20) from one blockchain to another is a big deal. It's not. There are no simple converters for the broader blockchain functionality. This is not a push button process. An ERC20 token is not the real world application being converted, it's just a simple token. Nothing special.
* ETH 2.0 model outshines all in the areas of decentralization. There's a lot of discussion about types of ""Proof-of-Stake"" (a validation method of the blockchain ledger). ETH 2.0 allows individuals to stake (validate) the ledger. Projects that claim to be cheaper/faster use delegators (cartels), often calling their method ""Delegated"" or ""Dynamic"" Proof-of-Stake (or other names), which essentially forces control of the chain in to groups, so for example, exchanges could assume control. ETH 2.0 stakers can opt in to join pools, but pools are not required. Got 32 ETH? You can stake as a individual.

**Ethereum's supply (and other common new-person questions about ethereum)**

* ETH is not capped, but restricted, capped is unlikely to be secure. Ethereum's monetary policy is best described as ""minimum issuance to secure the network""
* ETH issuance and burn is more sophisticated than Bitcoin. Under EIP-1559, some ETH get's burned (removed), which is projected to be greater than issuance (created). Everything is about creating a stable network, rather than and arbitrary cap. Bitcoin IS inflationary, and will be until we're all dead. Ethereum has a true deflationary mechanism
* What I see - anyone saying that ETH isn't scarce or anyone saying a ""hard cap"" is healthy for blockchains:
   * doesn't understand math and securing blockchain systems
   * is purposely deceitful
   * trying to pitch their corpo-coin
* You might hear someone say ""immutable"" or ""code is law"" or similar topics, in references to ethereum's early history. Young blockchains are technologies that often have issues that needed sorted out to build trust. Bitcoin had a really bad event that had to be fixed (lots of bitcoins were generated by an exploit). But it got repaired. Ethereum had a similar event, and some will try to split hairs about how Ethereum's event was different. In the end, blockchains require trust or they will not be validated. In the end, Ethereum has garnered that trust, by devs, by investors, and just starting, industry.
* What about ""eth-killer"" (enter whatever) doing such and such?
   * The graveyard of ""eth-killers"" is VAST:  ICX. QTUM. VET. ZIL. EOS. ONT. XTZ. IOTA. NEO. STRAT. AION, Rootstock, ETC (to name a few). We have a new wave of them now. My advice. Stop pretending you can ""kill"" ethereum and starting thinking how you can contribute to the world ethereum is creating.
   * But the gas-fees are too high... Yes, they are. Because the chain is being used. But L2 (above chain) solutions are already out ([an example](https://blog.synthetix.io/l2-mainnet-launch/)) for developers to start using. Plus other updates coming in a few months, such as  EIP-1559 and the GETH client this summer (which makes a lot of upgrades). FUDing gas costs now though is justified, but don't think untested/unused projects have any edge, especially with upgrades on a functioning chain (ethereum) are here, with more coming.

**More opinion, not advice**

* The order of importance is Ethereum, Bitcoin than any of the players trying to innovate the space, which are overwhelmingly building on Ethereum.
* I no longer see any other independent blockchain as relevant compared to Ethereum. I did a few years ago, but many of those projects failed their vision, some disappointed greatly
* Ethereum 2.0 will easily cover my prior concerns. So to me, it's done - if blockchains have a future, it's Ethereum's future. (mostly)
* I do see plenty of interesting defi projects (on Ethereum, of course). They are all MUCH higher risk than Ethereum. itself.
* I have a minority opinion, it seems Bitcoin is irrelevant compared to Ethereum. It's more just name recognition.
   * Ethereum already does more than Bitcoin, including more transactions, but that's not the reason I see Bitcoin as irrelevant
   * The major valid argument supporting Bitcoin (compared to ETH) is that it is a simple blockchain. It remains a powerful upgrade to gold, a better store of value. Ethereum, while more capable, involves innovations, which adds potential risks. AND ETH 2.0 is not fully here yet
   * I do, somewhat, agree with the above argument, in the short term, but if ETH 2.0 works (and it seems it will) and it fully becomes a computer-ledger for the world (a bigger ""what if"" for all crypto), then ETH becomes a more fundamental resource to society than Bitcoin. ETH, then, is a better store of value. Bitcoin is irrelevant.
* Working together - I see it. Other chains (yes, which ever one you're holding bags for) may still be around in a couple of years. To Kill Ethereum, you need to do something absolutely unexpected, like turning a phone into a camera. Turning gold digital. Turning digital gold into an app store (Ethereum). What's next? Something HUGE, I suspect some day, but NOTHING I see now in this space is anything other than just a shadow/subordinate of Ethereum (in my opinion).",gnbwhi1,2021-02-14 10:24:22,47

I'm in the process of getting some GPU's to throw whatever little hashpower I can muster up at a pool in support of EIP-1559.


Be vigilant everyone. These ""debates"" in cryptocommunities tend to end up being divisive. The narrative can quickly change and we can find ourselves in the minority. I've experienced it before with Bitcoin and I would hate to see it happen here. I doubt that something like that can happen to the Ethereum community, but it doesn't hurt to be on guard.

Tricky_Troll,"Here's a response of mine from further down which I think is going to get buried:

It's basically answering why I think that Cardano or any other ETH killers won't overtake Ethereum.

- Ethereum has the largest network effect of any smart contract platform (Don't underestimate network effects. Why else would an obsolete blockchain like Bitcoin still be number 1? Imagine how much effort is required to migrate all of DeFi onto a new chain. It would be like moving a mountain with a shovel).

- Ethereum is the only chain with valuable block space. The reason why gas fees are so high is because people are willing to pay a premium for the superior settlement guarantees, decentralisation and composability with the wide range of DeFi apps.

- Ethereum is the most provably neutral and decentralised. Most chains which have better scalability have given up decentralisation to achieve it. Something which Cardano proponents often brag about is the ease of staking, but this is actually because it is delegating stake. This results in more centralisation and less node operators. On Ethereum, if you want to stake without a separate entity like RocketPool or other staking pools, you have to stake 32 ETH. No more, no less. This makes staking harder for whales too as they have to run more validators. This has an extra effect on reducing the prominence of whales. I mean, just look at this chart of validator whales. It's so damn decentralised!",gnduooy,2021-02-14 19:47:24,38

I think when companies like Tesla start publicly buying, then we have definitively left the innovator stage, and one could even argue we are on the fringe of early adopters &gt; early majority. But the average person, even those whom I consider rather tech savvy, still doesn’t know much about Bitcoin other than it’s a crypto money thing and the price goes up and down. Imagine when the mindset that it’s good to own at least a little because it will gain value over time finally starts becoming a mainstream mindset. It’s never felt more feasible to me that maybe even by the end of this bull run, or beginning of next, a lot more people will have some btc in their portfolios, both big and small fish. When we make that transition fully, and I think we are seeing the beginnings of it now, it will make the GME and 2017 bull run craziness look tame in comparison.

FrankieSaints,"I don't know much about Eth, but the fees you described are exactly how it works on Bitcoin. If it costs $5 to send $100,000 you can choose for the fee to be $4.50 and save yourself 50¢

If there are hundreds of transactions waiting in the $4.51-$4.99 range, those will be processed first, and your $100k transaction sits in limbo until all transactions willing to pay $4.51+ are done.

On the flip side, if transactions are costing $5 in fees and you wanted to jump the line, you can choose $20 in fees and you'll be head of the line, taken care of first.

The fees creep up as more transactions at that price are requested. Say 1,000 transactions are waiting at $4.99 to $5.01.... the person paying $5.02 will jump ahead of the line, someone at $4.99 gets tired of waiting and retries at $5.05, someone else at $5.15, etc, and that's how the fees rise.

Now let's go worst case scenario: BTC is falling like a rock, everyone is trying to cash out. When thousands or millions are on the line, all of a sudden a $40 transaction fee doesn't sound so bad, and the surge of volume has people justifying higher and higher transaction fees so they can GTFO. I believe the 2017 crisis hit $55 fees (in other words - it doesn't matter how much money was in your transaction, you were paying $50+ or you were waiting indefinitely).",gnkr1r5,2021-02-16 06:28:29,5

RobinSanjiao,"https://www.ofnumbers.com/2021/02/14/bitcoin-and-other-pow-coins-are-an-esg-nightmare/  
&gt;Due to the rapid rise in some cryptocurrency prices, foundries that churn out semiconductors have months of backlogs due to GPU and ASIC demand.  Why?  Because there are only a small handful of foundries capable of manufacturing state-of-the-art chips and as a result there is a limited capacity irrespective of what the ultimate destination may be.  

&gt;This has led to a shortage of chips used in automobiles to the point where large manufacturers such as Ford or General Motors (GM) have announced plant shutdowns.  In its most recent earnings announcement, GM estimated that:  

&gt;The semiconductor shortage will shave $1.5 billion to $2 billion off adjusted earnings before interest and taxes this year.  

&gt;How much semiconductor output capacity is being squeezed because of PoW miners?  

&gt;Digiconomist estimates that TSMC – the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world which produces most, if not all, ASICs for cryptocurrency mining – would need 3-4 months at full-capacity of its 7nm output just to produce the ASICs for PoW mining equipment that have been ordered.

hipaces,"I think this will be Ethereum's Amazon moment.  I believe that 2017 was the Dot Com bubble.  

I will concede a couple of points:

1.  I didn't think we'd see so many dead altcoins pump this cycle
2. ETH will have to execute the strategy that it's laid out for staking, EIP-1559, Berlin, and ETH 2.0.  I think the market is ready but won't brook a 6 month delay.

Why do I think this is the Amazon moment?

&amp;#x200B;

1.  Defi is maturing at a rapid pace
2. Bitcoin has become culturally accepted by institutions, CEOs, and other king makers.  I believe ETH will find the same acceptance in the next 6-12 months
3. The tech roadmap for ETH is laid out for continued improvement to the protocol over the next 2 years
4. Dapps are there and ready to capitalize on ETH's scaling improvements.  There will be so much creativity in the crypto space ready to take advantage of improvements to Ethereum.

This isn't to say that ETH will be $10,000 by 2022.  Amazon's stock price has taken 20 years to get from the bottom to where it is today.  I just believe that the days of ""wait until crypto crashes 80% to buy"" are over.  There isn't enough skepticism in the market to allow BTC or ETH to crash 80% anymore because there's too many believers who will scoop it up at 20-, 30-, or 40% discounts.",gnl2kxe,2021-02-16 08:03:39,7

NotCloseToFour,"There is a thread that was posted a few hours ago that is asking about Litecoin's price peak for this bull run.  I took a few minutes to write out this reply, so I might as well share it here too:

$2.5k to $6k is my prediction.  A lot of people will come and accuse me of pure hopium, but I do think that this range is very reasonable given the market conditions.

First off, I believe that Litecoin will surpass a price of $1k prior to this summer.  Both the LTC to USD and BTC charts look extremely bullish.  With Bitcoin being over $50k, Litecoin doesn't even need a .02 ratio to get to $1k.  I do believe that between now and the end of May, there will be massive gains on the Bitcoin ratio, which will bring us to $1k and beyond.  Not only do the charts look poised for a move up, but it is lining up with a pretty favorable lineup of positive news for Litecoin: Mimblewimble entering the code complete phase, possible news on Mimblewimble deploy date, Paypal/Venmo crypto integration that includes Litecoin, Flare network integration, massive Grayscale investments in Litecoin, etc.  The timing just makes sense.

Second, I can definitely see Bitcoin reaching a $250k to $300k price point this run.  I believe that the $1.5b Tesla investment is the start of what will be a trend of larger corporations adding cryptocurrencies to their books.  Not to mention the fact that there is already a lot more institutional interest in cryptocurrencies this time around compared to 2017 (see Grayscale).  With this additional institutional interest, we are definitely heading for a supply shortage that could see the price move much higher.  Bitcoin is the high tide that raises all ships.  If Litecoin regains its .02 ratio against Bitcoin, a $300k Bitcoin would bring Litecoin to the $6k at the top of my range.  Even if a .02 ratio never happens again, Bitcoin performing strong still helps Litecoin.

Third and finally, we are talking about blow off tops here.  Just based on how these blow off tops have performed in the past, they move quickly and violently, and they aren't exactly based on reason.  Once the FOMO hits, its a free-for-all on where the price may land.  If $6k does hit, I don't think it will be for very long - Litecoin only hit $420 for a split second during the last run.  No one should really be trying to time the top.  The better strategy is to sell on the way up.

So to conclude - I do think some people are underselling the price potential of Litecoin during this upcoming bull run.  As far as I'm concerned, $1k is a foregone conclusion, and the 2021 price top is well beyond that.  How much beyond that is obviously the million dollar quesiton.  Compared to other coins, Litecoin has had a slow start in 2021, but over the next few months, this thing is going to start moving quick.",gnxv1w5,2021-02-19 07:31:03,17

[Survival of the Richest: The wealthy are plotting to leave us behind](https://onezero.medium.com/survival-of-the-richest-9ef6cddd0cc1)

&gt; After I arrived, I was ushered into what I thought was the green room. But instead of being
wired with a microphone or taken to a stage, I just sat there at a plain round table as my
audience was brought to me: five super-wealthy guys — yes, all men — from the upper
echelon of the hedge fund world. After a bit of small talk, I realized they had no interest in the
information I had prepared about the future of technology. They had come with questions of
their own.

&gt; They started out innocuously enough. Ethereum or bitcoin? Is quantum computing a real
thing? Slowly but surely, however, they edged into their real topics of concern.
Which region will be less impacted by the coming climate crisis: New Zealand or Alaska? Is
Google really building Ray Kurzweil a home for his brain, and will his consciousness live
through the transition, or will it die and be reborn as a whole new one?

&gt; Finally, the CEO of a brokerage house explained that he had nearly completed building his own underground
bunker system and asked, “How do I maintain authority over my security force after the
event?”

&gt; The Event. That was their euphemism for the environmental collapse, social unrest, nuclear
explosion, unstoppable virus, or Mr. Robot hack that takes everything down.
This single question occupied us for the rest of the hour. They knew armed guards would be
required to protect their compounds from the angry mobs. But how would they pay the
guards once money was worthless? What would stop the guards from choosing their own
leader? The billionaires considered using special combination locks on the food supply that
only they knew. Or making guards wear disciplinary collars of some kind in return for their
survival. Or maybe building robots to serve as guards and workers — if that technology could
be developed in time.",gnz2k6n,2021-02-19 13:49:18,19

“in 2017 ... LTC when BTC explodes - a story

Well, as it seems to always be - the Litecoin Gods require tears, sweat, and blood. You must cry until your face feels weak and crusted with salt. Your clothes must fill and drip with sweat, and your fingers must freely flow blood from their worn furiously typing stumps. Only then will the Litecoin Gods take note.

But then they look on you with pity and smite you again. Down the ratio falls - 0.015, 0.013, 0.011... your heart churns at each step. ""Am I an idiot,"" you ask yourself. ""Am I a person that is destined to lose it all with bad investment decisions?"" You lash out online and in your soul. People around you don't know the raw flame of horror that burns deep inside turning nausea into pain into emptiness and back again. Bitcoin rises, shattering all expectation. The Litecoin Gods near their satisfaction.

Yet hold! HOLD you hear - you scream in desperation! Beaten and weak, drained and scared, you watch the ratio slow its nightmarish descent... 0.0105, 0.01... this must be it. How could it fa-- 0.0098!!! You shriek in agony at the zero digits! NO! No! How could this be? How could this possibly be?!

And as the ratio explores the depths of this new hole - the &lt;0.01 hole - you lose all hope. There is nothing you care about. The world is empty and dull. All that grows is self-hatred day-by-day, but even with that you feel apathy. The soul, festering with maggots and mold, decays within you.

But then, one night while you sleep... the Litecoin Gods chuckle having had their fill...

↓ 0.00565 ⛧0.00564 ↑ 0.00565

AND UP IT SHOOTS - past every number you couldn't stand to see - above 0.007, 0.008, 0.009, and even 0.01! For a moment you think to sell, but those thoughts are wiped clean. Litecoin was never a bad decision! Up and up - 0.013, 0.018 - you watch closely as it nears your break-even of 0.022 - what? Sorry I can't go out tonight I'm busy - the numbers flash across the screen as unbelievable capital flows into chikun coin! You knew it! You KNEW it!

1. The experience people were getting from centralized exchanges is not great. People are excited about the products we've been building in DeFi, with LPs and farming.  When BNB made a low-friction path to those products available, they got immediate mainstream adoption from the RobinHood gang.
2. Binance Chain Wallet is onboarding people to the idea of in-browser wallets as a substitute for accounts and logins.  If they want their marketplace to stay relevant, they'll build seamless network swapping of assets right into the wallet.  Binance bridge sucks, blocks small transactions and US users and then just stops working altogether.
3. BSC is basically a new Ethereum distro. I'm sure the Debian people were peeved when RedHat forked but really, this is great for the ecosystem.

Y_crab_Y,"Short answer is yes and yes, but there will always be a fee.

Long version...Sorry if this covers anything you already know...
Sender includes a fee with every transaction (in sat per byte) &amp; can choose how high to set it. 

The transactions go into the mempool and miners choose transactions (tx) to include in each block. Because they get the fee, generally going to choose higher fee txs first. 

At busy times when mempool fills with unconfirmed txs, senders will up their fee in a bid to have their transaction confirmed before others.

When users withdraw, coinbase will send txs with appropriate fee estimated to have them confirmed reasonably quickly.

When coinbase send out a tx, there could be many outputs to numerous user addresses in that tx, so the tx fee could be split amongst users, but the important point is coinbase dictate the fee applied, which varies.

Right now, fees seem high because the bull run is causing a spike in transactions (increasing sat/byte fee) and bitcoin at all time $ highs (increasing $ per sat). Was similar in 17.

Not much help now, but once you have BTC in your wallet, you'll be able to set fee yourself when you send next based on your time preference. 

Here's a link to mempool stats, which show pending transactions and current fees in sat/byte. Dont think we'll have low fees for a while.

The flip side to that is if you are not very organized or lose/misplace things easily then either have a lot of accessible backups in safe secure places or last resort leave it on Coinbase.

Merlin560,"Pnf Review.

This is a long one.  Get out your pencils and take notes.  This one will show you how to trade a situation like today.

[My annotated PnF chart](https://imgur.com/a/dS7Ry3s)

Today I wanted to post my version of the chart so you can see how to make some sense of this type of action on the chart.

The first thing to notice is that we were in a long pole warning.  That is where the LPW in purple is.  That means were are four boxes above the breakout (the green x.). This means the price has gone up too much without “support.”  It is ripe for a reversal.

The column going up had 17 boxes, so when it reversed, the expectation would be where the LPW Reversal Target arrow is pointed.  That would have been the first place you look for support.

We clearly blew through that, taking out stops on the way down.

The next stop would be the “local support.”  This is the boxes with the red \* in them.  This is a diagonal line up from the LAST low column.  This moves up and to the right every time we add a column.

Today that price would have been $51,413.

That clearly did not hold…so we were really falling hard.

The NEXT stop would have been the Negative Break Down Point.  That is listed as the NBD box and that is found one box LOWER than the previous low.  What this means is that we are about to break down, and probably form a new formation.  Local support is gone and we will continue down.

How much “should” we go down.  There are three ways to look at this.  First is to count the width of the formation.  In this case, marked in blue, the count is four columns.  If you add that number in boxes moving down you would be at $48,434.

The second way is to count the length of the last breakdown.  This goes back over a couple of columns…and the length of the column is 7 boxes.  If you overlay that on top of this column you can see we already exceeded that move.  That's OK…this why we look at different things.

Finally, you start looking at previous local support.  In this case it is again listed as he red asterisks coming up from the left.  The low target there is $47,80.  We did not quite get there is this time around.

To see support going down, you would just repeat this process using the previous support times.  I usually don’t keep them on my charts, just to keep them clean.

So if you were shorting this move, you would use those target levels to set the general areas where things “should” behave.    When it hit one of those support areas you would start looking for a reversal (moving BACK UP 3 BOXES.) . Sure you will lose catching the bottom, but the bounce back up could be good for a few percentage point gain.  

Keep in mind this is Bitcoin.  Bitcoin doesn’t give a shit about you or me.  It doesn't care about my chart..  It **ALWAYS** moves a little more than it should.  But it usually is close enough.  If you watch it.  NEVER blindly jump in on a move like this unless you are sitting on like a momma hen.

If you were to look at a ""normal one-day candlestick chart"" the low for this run is as obvious as the back of your hand.  You might not be able to pin a specific number, but if you can draw a straight line where things bounced around you can see it, plain as day.

If you are looking for TA to give you specific numbers, I would recommend Tarot cards.  You will be as lucky.  At least, Tarot cards are supposed to make you think about the message.

Setting up a chart like this from the one I usually link takes 5 minutes a day MAX.  It is MORE useful when trading traditional stocks (not high flying WSB stocks, but normal boring stocks.)

I don’t do a lot of day trading.  I do some swing trading.  This is more a daily routine than anything else.  What it DOES provide me is some “peace of mind” when it is dropping.  I “know” where things should go, and adjust my emotions accordingly.

If you are not using a system, any system, to assess your risk you are going to lose money.  

Don’t lose money.

I hope you found this helpful.  I hate watching people get worked up and lose money.  This doesn't have to be a casino.",gocx1y6,2021-02-23 02:09:27,64

If you only invest what you can afford to lose, set a minimum of 3 years to hold, and always zoom out on a chart and see today’s dip is nothing in the context of history then you’re more likely to come out with profit. It’s easy to get caught up in the fear, especially when media always scream about downward moves as being the end of Bitcoin, but remember why you invested and what you want to achieve.

Zeeblackbaron,"Grayscale has a trust set up for it and is hoarding Litecoin in droves. Sometimes they hoard more Litecoin than they do Bitcoin and Ethereum. It’s their third largest asset.

Litecoin is fundamentally similar to Bitcoin in terms of things like disinflation rate and halving cycles. The only major differences are the circulating supply, block time, and algorithm (Scrypt vs SHA-256). Therefore, it’s easier and more comforting to speculate that Litecoin’s price will spike up in a certain way by looking at Bitcoin’s historical price vs its disinflation rate.

It’s undervalued compared to what it should be worth (compare the Grayscale LCTN trust premium to LCT market price), but people are starting to notice that. Grayscale hoarding it is making people slowly wake up and start getting into it.

80% of it will be mined this year. When 80% of Bitcoin was mined in 2017, it’s price exploded by 19x in that year alone.

Paypal will support Litecoin as one of only 4 cryptos they’re currently suppoting, so its going to be useful for more than just gambling.

Litecoin has stayed in the top 10 list since its inception despite some new kids on the block like BNB, ADA, and DOT that I never heard of kicking it down a couple places. I am hoping for this trend to reverse.

Atlas_Black,"Want a sad story?

In 2009, when Bitcoin was less than $0.01/BTC, a friend of mine gave me $20 worth of BTC for my 19th birthday in June. 

He told me to hang onto it and it would be worth a lot of money one day. He tried explaining it to me in ways that sounded crazy, using phrases like:

- Universal currency. 
- Money of the future. 
- Completely digital source of income. 

Just stuff like that. 

I didn’t take it seriously, so 6 months later, in December... My 2 year anniversary with the girl I had been dating was coming up. I felt like doing something special, but I was jobless at that time. So I sold all 2130 shares of my Bitcoin for a profit of $1.67. 

With $21.67 in hand, I went to the store, bought the ingredients for her favorite meal, bought some flowers, and went to her place to get cooking. 

It was a really nice dinner. Totally crushed it. She was smiling through every bite. We talked, we laughed, we had a good time. She complimented the meal, and then dumped me as I was clearing the table. 

... Yeah... It came out of nowhere for me too. 

I didn’t give it much thought until December 2017, when Bitcoin came up in my new circle of friends. It was at $19,000 per BTC. They were all talking about how they had missed their chance to get in on it, and I just started thinking back to my birthday in 2009, and what that friend said, and how I had thought it sounded crazy. 

But what was really crazy is that I got dumped ON my 2 year anniversary, AFTER I had cooked that girl a plate of Fettuccine Alfredo that, adjusting for the modern BTC price, would be worth $40,470,000 dollars in December of 2017.

A few days ago, that Fettuccine Alfredo was worth $125,670,000. 

I tried looking up the friend who gifted it to me. We had lost touch after I moved out of state. All of his social media had been deactivated, but I was still friends with his sister on Facebook and Instagram.

Through some of her posts, I found out her brother (my old friend) had paid off his parents house, bought his sister a house, bought himself a house, sent his sisters to college, bought everyone in his immediate family new cars, and then stopped spending. 

The houses aren’t huge. He’s living very modestly for how much money he has. He just wanted to set up his family with all they needed and then be comfortable forever. 

I know for a fact he has an obscene amount of BTC left, or cashed it out for a ridiculous amount of money, because when he gave me my $20 worth, he told me that he had invested all $8000 of his savings into BTC. 

If $20 would have been worth $125million... His $8000 would be worth TENS OF BILLIONS (depending on when he sold).

Aaaand that could have been me as well.

Djungeltrumman,"Imo it’s not about the theory not applying anymore. It’s that when these text books were written, a car company with excess cash would open another factory and put the monetary stimulus to use in the real economy. Today it’s gone so far that when their pockets are overflowing, they’re investing in Bitcoin. This isn’t just a dig at Tesla, it’s a recurring pattern (although this is an extreme example). 

Monetary stimuli being sucked into things that are unrelated to the “real economy” is the real thief here imo. Pumping in trillions into the stock market has marginal to no value when the same companies can borrow at absurdly low rates. It’s basically a GDP black hole. 

Imagine a central bank just printed a trillion dollars. A commercial bank borrows it to lend it onwards. A big company borrows it at rates close to 0% and then puts it in literally any market, or just buys back its own shares. That’s just more debt and quite literally 0 output.

fractalfiction,"Honest question: how are the billionaires and hedge funds in control of  Bitcoin? 

The savvy investors/lucky speculators of blockchain tokens have had 10+ years to accumulate an asset that has gone up tens of thousands of percent, before any billionaire or institution even dipped their toes into it (publicly). This is very different from an asset class or market like Wall St, which has been a gated playground for the rich and institutions for over a century.

I think we are still early to this party. There are plenty of smart people that have uncovered market patterns that help retail investors like us to finally get a leg up on an investment that hasn't been completely frontrunned by the banks and billionaires.

I think that the new wave of smart contract blockchain projects like polkadot, cardano, avalanche, etc... will be foundational and give the retail investors opportunities to shape the way the new financial system could work. BTC can remain the store of value in the public domain, but we're still on the first or second floor of the new Proof of Stake skyscrapers. 


Finally, we need billionaires to push the market cap to where we all ultimately want to see BTC and the crypto asset class. They are the rocket fuel that can propel us to the moon. Without them investing billions and bringing BTC into the spotlight, good luck getting enough blue collar nerds invest enough to squeeze a few lambos out of some fringe speculation that isn't even institutionally adopted.

Bitcoin is the only reason ""cryptocurrency"" is becoming a household word. Bitcoin is the most accurate measurement of exactly how much the USD is inflating. Bitcoin's liquidity is sucking billions out of the stock market, precious metals, bonds, and traditional savings vehicles into a better system. It's undergone the longest, most persistent stress test of any other cryptocurrency.

A day is coming when Bitcoin has so much liquidity that its price stabilizes, and as much as some people here don't like to admit it, the only way you realistically get a 100 trillion market cap is through greed.

When Bitcoin becomes price stable, when half the world has heard of it and *knows how to use it,* then, and only then, does cryptocurrency become a true global alternative to central banking.

Maybe Bitcoin's fate is to just get wrapped onto the Ethereum network or whatever network becomes the real currency of choice. That's fine.

At the same time these posts were made, 10-15 bear accounts raided the StockTwits message board spreading the same fear in a clearly coordinated and planned attack.

Once the stock found a bottom, buy activity commenced, the bears vanished, and the reddit scam posts were removed.

Reddit was taken advantage of, yet again, by the market makers and hedge funds causing many redditors to sell in panic and lose their money.

I want to provide some counter points to the scam article, to explain a) why I believe this company is not a scam and b) why I believe this company is a solid investment.

Really?
https://ptpwallet.com/ looks pretty legit. Ptpwallet is on android and ios.
They run https://cannasos.com/ - looks pretty legit.

I don't see how you can call these guys fake- they looks like a development shop that would be contracted to help a miner launch crpyto. the coin is also proven real.

The coin isn't backed by gold - MISLEADING
In an attempt to be transparent the company has listed the legal disclaimer with the coin - including language that says in effect the coin is not backed by hard assets or credit. This means that you cannot redeem the coin for gold (they won't send it to you) and you can't get FIAT credit for your token from AABB. This doesn't mean though that the currency is not itself backed by gold reserves already mined and to be mined. It just covers the legal stance that AABB isn't going to mail you gold if you buy the token. Seems pretty standard legalese to me. BTW bitcoin doesn't have similar disclosures, would love to see that transparency....

There is more DD we can get into here, but the core arguments made is that this company is a giant scam, and the evidence, corroboration disproves that thesis pretty substantially.

The level of felony conspiracy and coordinated, flawless scam execution across multiple companies, law firms, IR firms, accounting firms with reputation on the line at this stage in the game is laughable if not tactically impossible to pull off.

AABB has money, gold, increasing awareness, and many upcoming catalysts including audit/uplist, coin launch, future mine development, shareholder dividend prospects etc... where they lack in easily accessible transparency is made up in potential for giant gains here.

Turns out, AABB looks as real as it gets in OTC land. Those who invested should do so knowing there is always risk, and do their own DD. Just don't get played so easily.

Now I do not know your financial situation, but I hope you are not chasing after peaks here (btw I hope you are good financially!). XRP is always one of the last to go up. To get to our previous ATH is a 700% increase still. Making the same gains as bitcoin has (3x its previous ATH) means a 21x ROI if we assume that XRP is going to make the same gains as BTC has. I am not a financial advisor, but I do see some very interesting opportunities in this market still.

TheFrozenPyro,"Answer: Surprise, it was just stocks all along!

I'm kidding but cryptocurrencies, as they are now, have a system similar to stock markets. While you do something similar to exchanging one currency for another (let's use bitcoin in this instance), you exchange enough money for one bitcoin. You could also exchange the same amount into one company for X amount of stocks. With the bitcoin, you own that coin as money of a different currency to freely do with it as you please; compared to stocks where you just own a small (or large) part of ownership in a company.

The problem is that there's not much that you can do with that bitcoin (or really ANY cryptocurrency), outside of specific groups and companies who will accept it as payment. Setting it into a similar situation with stocks where it's volatile money where it can just be held onto or sold back at some point and get back more, or less, than what you invested into it. So those who are investing in cryptocurrency are hoping that it becomes the next bitcoin where it eventually gains enough traction to rise up in price and make them more than what they put it... like stocks.

final_sprint,"I'm always stoked when I hear people attempt to quote ""all time"" percentage gains on Bitcoin. Literally, what initial price are you considering? $0.01? $0.0005? $1.00? This denominator is so small and has such an outsize effect on the result that ""all time"" gains are pretty much irrelevant.

If you say BTC is up 44,053 percent over its history, then the first price it must have traded at would be 1/440th of today's price of $47k, or $106. Bitcoin hit $100 for the first time in 2013 and markets were already well established. It had been $1 just a couple years earlier prior to the 2011 bull run to $32. It had traded far below $1 up to that point.

I see Bitcoin's first documented trading price quoted around the internet as $0.0008 in mid-2010 after a year or so of functionality in which there literally was no known price. That would put it at 47000 / 0.0008 * 100 = **5,875,000,000% gain**.

Maybe we use the 10,000 BTC for two Papa John's pizzas transaction as the benchmark for the ""first"" price. What do two such pizzas cost? $30? That would imply a BTC value of $0.003, and gains of ""just"" *1,566,666,666%*.

vorwrath,"Everyone seems to want to compare Tezos to Cardano, but the fact is that there are dozens, if not hundreds, of cryptocurrencies whose valuations make little sense. There are plenty of examples of lazy Bitcoin or Ethereum copy/pastes that have sky high valuations and are adding nothing to the cryptocurrency space. Why always complain about Cardano, which seems to be legitimate and to share many goals with Tezos?

I have a theory that we're in a place somewhat analogous to the 90s dot-com bubble. There is money flowing into cryptocurrency, but most investors simply don't have anywhere near the technical knowledge required to compare the fundamentals of the networks they're investing in. As a result, general hype, who is shouting the loudest, and observed growth of prices in the past, can often be bigger factors than technical assessment. Those blockchains won't necessarily be the winners in the longer term though, just as you can probably barely remember pets.com or boo.com. Several of the current giants that emerged from the dot-com era are companies that weren't widely hyped (or in some cases were even mocked by analysts) at the time.

I don't know how far that comparison will hold, but I think it's at least an important lesson about the value of using your brain, and not just picking what's currently being shilled the most.",goxfkil,2021-02-27 11:36:34,68

cryptoragstoriches,"Here is a birds eye view write up on the project. Ive mentioned it elsewhere but it frankly covers most of the project.

ADAs Differentiators:

Incredibly decentralized and proven mathematically as secure as Bitcoin. By the time March 31st hits the entire network will be fully operated and owned by the community with 100% of all block production being handled by community stake pools.

Fast, robust, built to scale, liquid democracy through on-chain voting, open to all. Allows the entire protocol to be community driven and able to make choices in a more robust manner compared to the industry standard.

The best network stack meta-data implementation in the industry. Extended-UTXO model offers Cardano the ability to run smart contracts safely while maintaining scalability capability.

Hard Fork Combinator technology offers seamless upgrades/hardforks. No obtuse or cumbersome forks with ADA unlike other blockchains who force end users to ""claim"" tokens or coins. This enables fully seamless upgrades.

Built on solid foundations by some of the best people in the industry, who have been working/planning this for over half a decade.  95+ research papers peer reviewed at cryptographic conferences https://iohk.io/en/research/library/ Multiple citations currently in the industry enabling ADA to also benefit from other projects research as they are building off of ADA's existing papers.

Current blockchain labs and partnerships in Tokyo Tech, University of Edinburgh, University of Wyoming,  University of Athens etc. This adds to a healthy educational network that enables further innovation with graduates from these blockchain programs eventually building on ADA.

Largest decentralized PoS network with no downsides to staking and no minimums. You just put it in your wallet and pick a pool. It takes about 3 clicks and you begin to earn ADA. No special hardware or electricity demand needed with no lockup. Your ADA can be moved at anytime.

NATIVE Assets + ERC20 Bridge converter + KEVM. Interoperability done right, nothing like custodial “wrapped assets”. Current ERC-20 projects can migrate over seamlessly and retain their same base code. This will allow their Eth dapps to run faster and cheaper on ADA. DEFI will no longer have the very high fees associated with it.

Native-Assets capable of benefiting from the EUTXO, integration with projects treated as first class citizens, capable of using all of the tools built on ADA without custom integration/smart-contracts.

Developer of the NiPoPow standard - https://nipopows.com/ enabling direct cross chain compatibility with all blockchain projects who adopt it. Will enable direct and decentralized chain-to-chain interoperability without any centralized custodials or middlemen protocols.

All ADA tokens / projects get their own treasury system and voting system built right in for their projects and communities. This is inherent to the system and allows other developers to take advantage of the same benefits as the base ADA protocol does.

Well thought out strategic partnerships, with the goal of providing decentralized finance and blockchain solutions to those who need it the most. Offices located in Ethiopia and operations around the developing world - There was a recently confirmed win found out in an interview with John Oconnor - head of IOHK's African Operations. https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/cardano-iog-reveals-worlds-largest-blockchain-deployment-in-africa/ - More info to follow on this with an Africa Special video from IOHK.

Proven solutions in Supply-chain tracking (Beef-chain) along with PoC's done with New Balance (tracking counterfeit shoes) and Ethiopia (Coffee tracking)

ADA has its own smart-contract language next to the KEVM - Plutus.

ADA will also eventually support legacy programming languages - Python, C++, Java etc.  This will allow future onboarding of current mainstream developers who have not tackled a blockchain project. This is accomplished via the K-framework and is what is enabling the Solidity smart contracts to run.

Plutus smart-contract language has been in development for years by the same people who created Haskell. Useful for any scenario that requires high assurance - Flight systems, Banking networks - perfect for Blockchain / monetary systems.

Built to run a L2 scaling solution called Hydra. This is a layer 2 scaling solution that will allow for unlimited scaling up to (n)  Each stake pool adds 1000 additional tps to the network. At current pool count (1.5K pools) this will allow a theoretical TPS of 1.5 million TPS but will grow with the additional SPO's operating the network. This is currently 15x faster than Vitaliks Eth 2.0 speeds (100,000 tps) This solution does not require security trade offs unlike sharding does but down the road we can shard the base later if we wish and the science pans out. The EUTXO is actually easier to shard than Eth's Account base model.

Sonic: Zero-knowledge snarks in the future.

Multi-oracle Solution - https://cryptoslate.com/how-iohk-will-put-developers-in-charge-of-oracles-on-cardano/: First partner is wolfram alpha - same guys who power siri, amazon echo etc. Developers will be in full control of their choice of oracle and other oracles are able to be onboarded into the framework.

Decentralized voting through the built in wallets, that provides rewards as an incentive to participate and use your voting rights.

Community voting for funding projects from the built in treasury. This incentivizes developers to pitch their idea to the community to receiving funding. System is an inherent venture capital incubator due to this - over 100 million dollars in the ADA treasury to fund developers and entrepreneurs currently. Eth does not have this at all and so is not as self sustaining as ADA.

Decentralized re-useable identity, provided through use of verifiable entities. Atala prism as mentioned in the above article -https://www.atalaprism.io/ This solution runs directly ontop of the Cardano protocol.

277,000+ User delegates

1935+ Nodes/Validators/Pools.

72~% Supply already being staked / delegated already. This lowers liquidity in the open market and also inherently promotes holding coins as opposed to actively trading them. People CAN still move the ADA if they wish but many may choose to just collect the ROI from the rewards as it is risk free.

Copied from another answer of mine:

There's a severe shortage of semiconductors, a vast majority of which are from Taiwan (TSMC is the largest). It's even impacting the automotive industry and the White House is getting involved: https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/01/semiconductor-shortage-halts-auto-factories/

EU is considering the same. 

The reasons for the shortage?

* Pandemic. For a large part of last year the foundries were shut down in Asia. 
* Overwhelming demand due to WFH and people looking for alternative entertainment. That includes phones, laptops (Apple M1 is a huge drag), CPUs, GPUs and yes consoles. These semicondutors are used in a lot of things.
* Prioritization. AMD is prioritizing consoles over the Ryzen or the Radeon chips. Apple bought out tons of time in the foundries so they cannot produce other things.
* The amount of time it takes to create a brand new plant is insane. I've heard anywhere from 1-2 years just to get it up and running.
* Yes bitcoin mining does add to the demand but it's not the only factor.

If mining dropped off you'd see the second hand market finally stabilize and the newer cards would be available for more than a few nanoseconds, but it won't solve the problems.",gpkgf8h,2021-03-04 04:26:52,132

Mid 2018 I sold around 5% to cover rent and various expenses, and divested around 10% into alts like ETH and ADA. But other than that, no day trading, just hodling 24/7.

Close to the start of this bull run I became a millionaire, and recently a multi-millionaire. If some of the outlandish predictions come close to reality this year, it’s conceivable I could reach 8-figure net worth. 

And I’ve never felt more scared in my life. I feel like I have no idea what I’m doing on this rocket, and my ticket got mixed up with someone else. I mean I come from an extremely blue collar family, low education, low income, tech illiterate, etc. and here I am in practically another stratosphere financially. Somewhere I’ve never planned to be, nor have any idea how to navigate. 

As I also keep all my funds on hardware wallets  - and even though I’ve carefully done all the recommended security measures - I still feel the incredible weight of the responsibility. I feel like there’s four pallets of cash under my mattress that’s secured with a tiny padlock inside my brain. No one ever talked about this part of “be your own bank.”

I told my wife about it all recently and she’s thrilled, but equally at a loss for what to do with it all. The rest of my family doesn’t know anything about it. 

I mean I’m not asking you guys for financial advice because I know that’s not what this subreddit does. I’m just feeling overwhelmed and wonder if anyone else is in a similar situation. How do you get your head around “being rich” and being comfortable and smart about it? 

I have some plans like maybe going to college and getting a degree, putting a down payment on a house, buying a car, etc. But the rest I have no idea. It’s just insane looking at my net worth (actual and potential) and trying to filter through all the possibilities and decide what to do with it all. And then there’s Saylor talking about not selling at all, just leveraging your holdings to accumulate debt to pay for what you want. Wtf really? 

To be clear, this is not a “boo hoo poor me” comment. I’m excited and happy beyond belief and grateful for being at the stage of starting a family with a nest egg the size of the Hindenburg. It’s just that I’m in way over my head and don’t want to make any mistakes in planning the rest of my life. If I’m smart with this I could take care of my parents, family, kids, grandkids, have my dream job, and make the world a better place maybe. If I’m financially foolhardy I could maybe make a good life for a few years but then have reality hit me in the face when it all runs out. 

And thanks to everyone in this sub for educating me and keeping me sane through all this. I post here every once in a while with my main and it’s really the most mature online place to discuss BTC in my opinion. I’d post this in other subs if I wanted lambo memes, I come here for the head checks.",gpmju23,2021-03-04 15:10:19,111

Liberosist,"A simple Uniswap v2 trade currently costs \~125,000 gas. That means only 100 Uniswap trades can be executed in 1 block, or 7.7 TPS. Multi-routed trades cost more, of course. According to Vitalik\*, this can be reduced to 224 gas on Optimistic Ethereum, leaving us with 4,000 TPS on eth1, 92,000 TPS with eth2 DAS. Of course, this is an ideal scenario for reasons mentioned in Vitalik's post, but make no mistake: scalability is here. 

Massive scalability + massive security &amp; decentralization: Ethereum is the only network even attempting it. Everyone else has given up on decentralization, and Bitcoin (the only other decentralized network) has given up on scalability.

Black_Sky_Thinking,"Yup, this is what gives me a low opinion of a lot of ""professional"" analysts.

Bitcoin clearly exists. And it's trading around $50k today. So it's *possible* to make money off it. And there's a non-zero probability of it going up 20x. 

The only factual, logical conclusion is that is does have some sort of value, and it's possible it may appreciate a lot more. So it would be irrational for everyone to allocate zero investment to it. 

&amp;#x200B;

If someone says they're not investing because of their risk appetite, or because they've assessed it and they think it's going to go down, then fair enough. If you're a retiree with a low risk appetite and a portfolio full of bonds, I understand bitcoin isn't for you. 

But I still see people who should know better denying bitcoin completely. Claiming that bitcoin is currently worthless, will always be worthless and there is a 100% chance of loss and 0% chance of any profits for any investor, ever. 

They're free to think what they want, but that's an irrational position driven by strong emotional biases, and they lose all credibility as financial authorities in my view.",gpnhhbk,2021-03-04 22:50:03,111

warrior2012,"Xlm is a great blockchain and has great technology, but there are still quite a few differences between Nano and Stellar where Nano has the advantage.

We already know about speeds. Nano is a fraction of a second transact time and Stellar takes 3-5 seconds. This isn't a major difference that would be recognized by the average user.

We also already know about the fees. Obviously, nano is feeless and Stellar has a miniscule fee. The stellar fee is set to 0.00001 xlm. This is supposed to be the static fee and never changing. This 1/10000 of a coin also doesn't seem like much to the person sending dozens, hundreds or even thousands of xlm. The people who get left out are people who live in places like Venezuela. That fraction of a coin will be the difference of people being able to afford those fees, especially as the price of the coin goes up, the dollar value of the fee goes up.

Now let's talk about a few things that people don't usually discuss too much while comparing these two coins. First off, Nano is completely in circulation. There will never be another coin minted or created. Stellar has less than 50% of coin cap, actually in circulation (22.5B/50B).

Lets also talk about wallet minimums. With Nano, you can have 1^30 of a Nano (smallest divisible amount) and you can keep moving that as much as you like. See current spam on the network of a user sending the absolute minimum back and forth. https://nanocrawler.cc/ even with this person spamming transactions, there hasn't been any issues or slowdowns. With this spam, Nano handled more transactions yesterday than Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin combined. 

With stellar you need to have a minimum of 1 xlm in the account to open the wallet. You cannot remove that 1 coin ever. I understand the reasoning behind this, but it could be seen as a deterrent to small crypto users as they know they are never going to be use that one coin.

These two coins are very similar in what they try to accomplish. However, go about their solutions in very different ways. I believe that both of these currencies can co-exist, but I personally think that Nano has the edge advantage. Thats my two satoshi worth on this discussion.",gpoleq2,2021-03-05 03:46:20,234

vitaminBTC,"You are totally correct, I agree fully. It is not because Bitcoin is appreciating in value that is why it will become the base value holder for the entire future of world commerce. The price appreciation is just the market recognizing over time that Bitcoin is a standalone system outside of the world of central banking and finance capable of final settlement without concern for borders, apolitical and neutral, permissionless and nearly frictionless, open for transactions 24/7/365 and with open markets every second of the day with a bid and an ask in practically every currency pair, free from government manipulation and debasement. (PS did you know that the stock market is open 6.5 hours a day, 5 days a week, or 32.5 hours per week, ie - open only (7x24=168) 32.5/168, just under 20% of the time, not including holidays or circuit breaks. That means every year of Bitcoin trading is actually 5+ years of stock market trading) 

The problem with comparing Bitcoin to the massive list of companies/commodities/currencies that have shot way up before coming crashing back down is, how many of those experienced massive drawdowns, were left for dead, and then they rose again to even higher levels than ever thought possible before? Its crashed, and I mean CRASHED, about a dozen times with 80% or more drawdowns -- curiously though, always at higher lows. And here we are somehow, scraping $50k a coin, 900 Billion dollars worth of value created out of uhhh - a bit of ingenious code and a transparent ledger.

The question you must ask yourself is, why? Why does it not die? It has every reason to! No other example comes to mind of anything coming back from the dead once, let alone multiple times. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin is a protocol layer on top of which the application layer rests. The only comparable example is TCP/IP - otherwise known as, the internet. The internet digitized and democratized information- it is now in the same power as you and I as someone with access to the world's best minds to find out whatever we want at the absolute cost of ZERO. Bitcoin is the digitization of money, it is the democratization of money. Today only the privileged in first world countries can have access to bank accounts, credit cards, checkbooks... To send a wire internationally you can pay $35 and wait a couple of days, that is if the country you are sending to is a country your country is down with and the amount of money does not raise any eyebrows in compliance departments. 

&amp;#x200B;

But we are now in the process of seeing the transformation that will allow any person anywhere the ability to send money unfettered, without questions, without unreasonable fees, nearly instantaneously, from Istanbul to Venezuela if that is where their family members live, on a Saturday, at 11PM, and the person receiving it is not charged extortion fees, or bullied, or marked, or followed, or known to have received any value whatever. 

How much is something like that worth? 

&amp;#x200B;

So in the end if price is all you see, there is a reason for it, it is the iceberg under the surface that you are not seeing, this irresistible, unstoppable force that has been released into the world without hope of curtailing it no matter how much those who control the money supply might try. 

And that is because Bitcoin, without firing a single round and without spilling a drop of blood, has forever placed beyond the reach of man the ability to manipulate and control the money. It is a voluntary system with clearly defined unchangeable rules (21M BTC, Nodes, Proof of Work, Difficulty adjustment, permissionless, non-sovereign, neutral, Supply schedule set in stone for the next hundreds of years) that if you would like to participate in, you are more than welcome to. If you decide you don't like it, you may sell it and leave. And without a CEO, marketing team, or coercion to transact in it as in FIAT, it has made people believe in it to the point of it being today one of the top 15 companies/ commodities/currencies with the highest of market caps, and it is the only one that looks bent on rising the ranks faster than any of the others. And for the first time in its history the macro external outlook has made it look by comparison, FOR THE FIRST TIME, as a desirable place to park value by those with value to park, accumulating enough liquidity to interest public companies. Validation for the thesis subtly embedded in the first block, ambitious and ridiculous in its scope and imagination, PLAYING OUT IN REAL TIME, earning respect in the eyes of the most serious of capital allocators. 

And isn't it interesting that as the price appreciates, it actually becomes more useful and valuable, a better network, more reachable to bigger and bigger entities? It is the world's most fine-tuned positive feedback loop ever witnessed. Created by someone (anonymous of course, how else!) who understood this needed to be a public utility (as in water or electricity) and never cashed in on their deca-Billions! IS YOUR MIND BLOWN YET

Bitcoin is in the envious position of having time on its side. Everything else feels like it is borrowing against the future at ever-steepening costs to attempt to keep the charade going for another day. Short term gain, long term pain. Every decision at a corporate and government level today is made with the short term in mind, without paying a lick of mind to the long term. Bitcoin just mines another block. And another one. Miners keep dedicating to it more hashpower. It gets stronger and more secure. Monetary policy automatically tightens every 210,000 blocks/ approx every 4 years. Price rises. And the loop goes on. 

With this scenario as laid before you, in the long term, how does this all play out from here? 

Bitcoin in the end, is an unalienable right. Like water. Like electricity. Like the internet, arguably. 

because...  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. And that includes freedom of monetary opression. For every human being on the planet, INDISCRIMINATELY, let freedom ring.

What do you consider the chances are that your investment thesis, as you've described it, might be wrong? What would have to happen to make this turn out badly?

There may be others, but I'm just naming what I think of off the top of my head.

shawnz,"&gt; Fiat currency has no intrinsic value in that it is just paper or plastic or coins. But there is the consensual agreenment of value (which bitcoin has)

Agreed.

&gt; ... but on top of that also has an intrinsic value BECAUSE it is regulated. Inflation is kept under control. Money printing or lack thereof is done in order to maintain stability and low volatility. On top of that governments(not perfect) provide safety, insurance as do the banks for fraudulent transactions and stolen money. If I go to the police or any authority they will provide some help.

Agreed, these things are all benefits of using fiat currency for most people. (I think it's debatable whether that is properly called ""intrinsic"" value but that's just semantics).

&gt; Bitcoin has neither of those. The qualities and applications or beauty of it start and end in the digital realm. In the real world it has become a scam and used by criminals mostly.

In certain applications it is exactly BECAUSE it doesn't have any inflation control or reversible transactions that it provides a benefit. You don't always need those properties, and most people might never need them, but sometimes they can be desirable. For example, Argentinians probably never thought they would be needing to escape their government's currency controls 50 years ago. So what will we think 50 years from now? Bitcoin provides a hedge in case the systems we rely on fail in unexpected ways.

&gt; For the sake of simplicity let's say they make an initial coin offering ...

Frankly, I don't love the idea of ""initial coin offerings"". They make it easy to create scams like you describe. Cryptocurrencies which are not pre-mined provide a major advantage in this way: The creators of the coin don't have an incentive to manipulate the price for their own benefit. Bitcoin was not pre-mined and so those kind of arguments don't really apply. Although the anonymous creator ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" did mine many coins for himself while Bitcoin was still relatively unknown, so you might say in that sense even Bitcoin was kind of ""pre-mined"", although those coins have never been moved and it is widely assumed that ""Satoshi"" is dead (it's commonly assumed his identity was actually crypto researcher Hal Finney).

&gt; Acoin starts being traded. News hits, people talk about it, some people make money on it. THIS IS PART OF THE SCAM TO DRAW IN NEW MONEY TO THE GAME. Because if nobody made any money, no one would care. ... It is just like how the government will post pictures and prizes of winners to make people THINK they have a real chance

What you are describing is more like a pump-and-dump scheme than a ponzi scheme. Any asset can fall victim to a pump-and-dump if the volume is low enough for it to be manipulated, it is nothing specific about the asset itself. The ""fix"" for that is to get more speculators into the market, since having more speculators makes it harder to manipulate the price (as you have to compete with the speculators in order to change the price). If you believe that people are mistakenly overvaluing it then it is a great shorting opportunity for you, which will allow you to profit from the people who are mistaken and also close the price gap to prevent future investors from being tricked. To suggest that speculators are just leaving those obvious shorting opportunities on the table doesn't really add up.

&gt;  So how do I even know now that the crypto equivalent of wall street/hedge funds are not or (have not been already) artificially pumping the price up with insider transactions? ... I am sure people who had BB stock and held to sell right before its bubble burst thought they were very smart but really they just got lucky. It is impossible to know what will happen.

Like with any investment, just ignore the hype you read on finance sites and make your own informed decision about the valuation. For example, lots of risky/uninformed speculators got burned during the dot-com bubble. But were people wrong to be excited about web businesses at that time? I am certainly not suggesting you should go remortgage your house so that you can spend it all on Bitcoins -- I am just saying it's an interesting new asset class that is worth considering and might even be worth investing a small percentage of your portfolio.

Maybe you think Bitcoin is useless for you, I think that is pretty typical for most people living in a first-world country with a stable currency that has stood strong for decades. In that situation it is hard to see the advantage of Bitcoin. But not everyone is in that situation and therefore Bitcoin does have value for those people. Like you say we also can't predict the future, and there are many situations that Bitcoin can provide a hedge against, so I don't think it is unreasonable even for westerners to want to hold a small amount of their portfolio in Bitcoin just to account for those tail risks.

&gt; I have a suspicious feeling whoever or whichever group made this knew exactly what they were doing to extract money from the system into the illegal world. 

Fully agree, whoever created Bitcoin was well aware that it would be used to bypass laws. But the same is true of every encryption technology: We don't seriously talk about banning encryption because it lets criminals communicate in secret, so why do we talk about banning Bitcoin because it lets criminals transact in secret?

The US could get rid of the fourth and fifth amendments and it would be easier to catch criminals that way. But it would also be easier for politicians to create overreaching policies that hurt citizens' freedoms. So as a society they have decided that the fourth and fifth amendments are necessary checks and balances even though they make committing crimes easier.

&gt; So to advertise crypto as a safe and reliable investment wouldn't really make sense

Agreed, crypto is not a ""safe and reliable investment"" and it would be wrong to describe it that way. Perhaps in 20-50 years when cryptocurrencies are more understood then maybe it will be considered equally as ""safe and reliable"" as gold (which is still not very ""safe and reliable"").",gq3lbh2,2021-03-07 23:32:47,1

foamius,"Crypto in a super cycle bull market.  It breaks down into 3 pieces- bitcoin (store of value- digital gold), ethereum (tech, innovation, defi - digital oil) and alt coins (the micro cap of crypto).  Bitcoin (the apple of crypto -blue chip)is the undisputed market cap leader and pioneer in the space-  Mike Novagratz. Bill Miller, John Tudor Jones, Cathie Wood, Mike Saylor are bulls.  Ethereum is the backbone for the defi movement and has actually outperformed bitcoin in 2020 and I believe in 2021.  As for alt coins focused on defi space and long SNX and Chainlink- these are strong alt coins with superior teams and tech behind them.   If you like DOGE as a spec I prefer VectorSpace (VXV) a low floater alt coin with outstanding mngt from UC Berkeley (Kasian Franks- serial entrenpeneur)- VXV’s technology creates unique datasets.  The AI, NLP and data analytics market is expected to grow exponentially Thru 2030.  I believe Vxv with a much smaller float than doge will significantly outperform it.",gq3lsh8,2021-03-07 23:37:40,1

The most bullish element right now is not the coilled spring on the charts, but just how quickly the bitcoin ecosystem has continued to grow. No one just 4 years ago, let alone the earlier days, was predicting this much onboarding by the mainstream financial community. We are past the point where retail onboarding matters, real money is coming in at a faster and faster rate.

The only way to be bearish on bitcoin at $50k is to think that momentum and constant onboarding will somehow reverse itself.

The move up continued overnight and into this morning.

There was that crazy Ivan last night that scared the crap out of a lot of people.  That was fun to watch.

This morning we continued up the column of Xs and hit the point where we passed the High Pole Warning.  This happens when the price moves up over 4 boxes from break out point.  This is marked with purple highlights.

When we hit a high pole warning, we should be cautious about a reversal and drop down 50% of the column.  This reflects the part where the price has simply gotten ahead of the market.  It doesn’t mean the world is ending.  It doesn’t mean the “bull run” is over.  If you are day trading you should know the stop points on the way down.

If you are swing trading, don’t get worked up until the price does something outside a normal movement.

So here are the prices today:

1.  The price hit a high pole warning.  The current column is 19 boxes high.  The High Pole Warning Reversal target is 8/9 boxes down.  That price would be in the $51400 area.  

2. We hit the first price target at $56,230 box.  The second price target (for the next week in normal stocks, but much sooner in bitcoin.) is $57,360.

3. We already broke out and we are moving in areas without local resistance.

4. The break down would happen down around $46,100.

5. The trend line has not changed.  The trend trade is up 146%.

Expect some short term profit taking from this last run—which is almost at 20%.  Why wouldn’t we expect profit taking.  But the downside is pretty limited at this point.  Nothing out of the ordinary has happened to change that.

Watch out for Crazy Ivans.

* In the past 24 hours the market cap has grown only slightly. 
* Bitcoin leading the charge. Going from 55k to 57k and bouncing around a lot between 56k and 57k
* BTC gaining 1.3% dominance. 
* ETH disappointing its fans by not even hitting 1.9k. Their tears falling on bitcoin's gilded road.
* ATOM was unable to hold its $20.
* XLM shows it can be less stable by moving down some.
* Most alts down from the day before. Some are calling it a dip. The wiser call it sideways movement. 
* FTM's big pump was stopped short and FTM fell down some afterwards.
* VET seems to want to move below 6 cents. 
* BAT showing off again, almost breaking 2018 ATH. 
* Bitcoin gold somehow one of today's gainers. 
* Random person talked about being bullish on BCH.
* Hatred for personal stories is greener than any crypto gains.
* Most still up for the week! 
* Mostly unknown to westerners NEM is this week's biggest top 100 loser with a 25% drop. 
* NEM also biggest loser of the day with 16% down, followed by FTM with 14% down. 
* THETA's fuel is the biggest top 100 gainer of the day with 64% up!
* CHZ biggest top 100 gainer of the week with 189% followed by the fuel with 138% up. 
* Today mental image is the big king solo-stampeding all the alts, destroying their beautiful green dildos and revealing the blood inside.

HappyGoLuckyBoy,"In short, yes you are getting lucky. Everyone is getting lucky. I am 47 and I haven’t seen a bull market like this since the tech revolution. Back then you could throw a dart at a stock and it would make you money. We’re not that far from that today. 

So as far as bitcoin goes it’s just like anything else, and this is a rule passed down from grandfather to father to me to my son and I’m just gonna share it with you because it’s the number one rule of investing as far as I’m concerned:

You cannot time a market.

Sure, you can find a good entry point to stake out a position. And you are right on target buying on a crash while everyone else is scared. That is the first part of a solid strategy. But what you are doing? Jumping In and out and in and out? It’s not a sustainable strategy in the 30 years I have actively been trading. At some point when it stabilizes, and you sell,  it may very well just push further and establish a higher “stability point” from where you sold, and you have lost out on all of that additional gain

 Let’s say bitcoin is at 53,000 and drops to 47,000. You buy, and then when it goes back up to 53k and stabilizes, you sell. The next week it makes a breakout run to 60. You just missed out on that. 

It happens to new investors over and over and over and over and over again. Only when you get up to my age have you seen it happen enough times that you learn to just buy and hold, and timing the market is a sucker play. I read an article recently that said the boomers have figured this out and that’s why they just never sell. Same with the apes over in Wall Street Bets have figured out that holding is the key. 

Thing is, I was you once. And I wasn’t gonna listen to the words some stranger on the Internet said. So I get the feeling you’re gonna stick with your strategy until you get burned. But at some point you will. Either you will buy the dip and it will keep falling. Or you will sell the stabilization and it will keep rising. It’s just a matter of time.

TLDR: Hold",gqpy74e,2021-03-13 04:03:12,24
BigNastyHammer,"I got your back fam.

Monero is the Linux of cryptocurrencies.

Even nowadays, Linux is an operating system that causes fear and shivers to those who don't consider themselves technologically literate. This OS has always had great difficulty in conquering space in the area of personal computers. However, what most people don't know, is that unlike how it was in the past, today most of the digital infrastructure is Linux or Linux-based. Cloud computing, AWS, almost all of it is Linux-based. You use or benefit from Linux without even knowing.

Monero, like Linux, does not have a central entity responsible for marketing and education. Unlike 99% (no exaggeration) of other projects that have been pre-mined or receive some sort of ""reward"" from the miners, Monero does not have virtually infinite funds to buy ads, hire marketing firms, etc. The best example of the antithesis of this situation is Justin Sun with Tron. Seriously, who thinks Tron is really a great project? But Justin Sun manages to be in the spotlight constantly which helps in the promotion of his token. In Linux, the main advertisements in previous decades were produced by RedHat, Suse and IBM. Private companies that had a vested interest in promoting Linux. Not Linux itself, because Linux is just an open-source technology.

Similarly, in the Monero Project we are forced to create decentralized groups that have no money and are not necessarily coordinated to create advertising, education materials and general promotion of the project. It is extremely difficult to compete against massive marketing - but if we have learned anything from Linux, it is that over time superior technology wins.

Every person who believes in Monero has incredible potential to help the project. Create a Twitter account. Create educational materials. Translate them into multiple languages. Buy Monero stickers with a QR Code for the official website. Send emails to online stores and service providers you use, asking them to accept Monero. Help them implement it. Everything helps, and we need YOUR help to make Monero reach more people.

*“Ah but I am against spamming or shilling.”* If you understand why privacy is important, it is no longer a matter of just shilling. Using Bitcoin or another transparent currency can be LITERALLY a matter of life and death, for people who live under authoritarian regimes or find themselves in extraordinary situations. These people depend on others who are promoting and educating about the technology of our beautiful and beloved Monero Project.

With the organic growth of our community and more people effectively participating in efforts to improve the scene, there is no doubt that Monero will follow a similar path to Linux and we will soon be dominant in the market. There will be more transactions by individuals on Monero than on Bitcoin, which is doomed to the fate of having txs only between exchanges and other corporate and government entities. It will be virtually impossible for the average person to transact on-chain when fees cost $1000  or more.

Monero is king and is a currency used today, in real life, by people whose physical security depends solely on the currency being private. Nothing beats that.",gqq299w,2021-03-13 04:34:27,9

Theoretical_Action,"&gt;Let’s say bitcoin is at 53,000 and drops to 47,000. You buy, and then when it goes back up to 53k and stabilizes, you sell. The next week it makes a breakout run to 60. You just missed out on that.

To further this analogy for anyone still not convinced let's compare three strategies. The first being the strat where you only time your entry to the market and nothing else. The second two being where you trying to time frequent entries and exits. 

Strat 1) You buy when it drops from 53k to 47k and HODL. Bitcoin rises back to 53k again but it doesn't matter you're HODLing this. Over the next year it has it's ups and downs, none of which concern you, and by end of 2021 it rises to 60k and it stabilizes there for, lets even go so far as to say a few years (unlikely but for purposes of the illustration lets say it does). You cash out here and net yourself 13k in profit. 

Strat 2) You're trying to actively trade bitcoin. You buy the dip at 47k and sell at 53k. The next few weeks you're watching btc like a hawk for more dips. 2 weeks later bitcoin dips to 45k! A bargain! You snatch it up. A month and a half goes by and bitcoin has fallen to 37k. No problem, it'll go back up....it's bitcoin after all, right? Right...? It dips further to 33k and sits there for a month. You start to question your decision. It rises back to 39k and stabilizes there for another 2 months. You decide you'd rather just eat the loss than watch it fall back to 33k and stay there for years! You sell and wipe out your previous 6k profits that you took. 

Strat 3) You're trying to actively trade bitcoin. You buy the dip at 47k and sell at 53k. The next few weeks you're watching btc like a hawk for more dips. 2 weeks later bitcoin dips to 45k! A bargain! You snatch it up. A month and a half goes by and bitcoin has surged to 53k again. You sell and snatch your 8k profits. Bitcoin dips to 47k again and you decide what the hell, it's worked so far. You buy in. It continues dropping to 40k and sits there for months. MONTHS. You question your position again, but decide to hang on. You watch bitcoin fall to 38k. Then 35k. 30k. Can you hang on? Maybe you should sell SOME of your position? Maybe you do, maybe you don't. Lets say eventually you're tired of the stress watching this coin brings and decide you want out. You wait until btc gets all the way back up to 47k and exit breaking even on the last trade. Bitcoin rockets to 60k+ the next week. You've stressed and wasted all this time and effort for a measley 1k gain than you might have gotten over simply HODLing the whole time. 

Point is, not only can you not time the market, you will cause yourself a lot of extra stress trying to. Investing with your hard earned money sometimes really does make you forget how hard earned it was. Tossing 50k into an investment? No problem. Until that 50k is gone and you realize the last year of your life was just completely spent and wasted away on that decision. And trust me, it's never until *after* that decision that you can truly recognize what that means in the grand scheme of things.",gqqiqiu,2021-03-13 06:44:25,7

* While Bitcoin teased us with a new ATH yesterday, today it's just mocking about.

* News of ETH2 coming early is spreading slowly. Early without actual date attached, so... meh.
* ETH miners are rebelling.
* The day before, BNB disappointed us all with a tweet. The past day, they fudded us all with investigation news. Down a whole 10%. (Please rise bby, my bag needs you to rise!)
* CAKE and BAKE followed big brother BNB down into the abyss.
* ADA fell some more and might just end up below 1. Hah, ADA is such a n00b.
* Litecoin went against the majority and its history and actually gained today. People that fudded out the day before are now fomoing back in.
* XLM isn't sure what it wants except that it doesn't want to grow up. ATOM decides to follow stablecousin XLM.
* CHZ is again making waves, gaining over 100% and making sports fans all over the world big bucks. Almost having risen into the top 20!
* VET actually fell instead of grew the past day. VET fans are not complaining. This makes VET fans better than other cryptocurrency fans.
* NEM had an airdrop. The airdrop did not go as expected and the plane crashed.
* Another big wave maker has turned out to be ONE. No, not NEO, Harmony! 
* HOGE is still a big name in the daily and is bound to make lots of people great losses.
* Lots of talk about MANA going on, but nobody talks about what MANA is. lrn2shill

Within maximum of 2 years the Bitcoin is going to be regulated, restricted by rules and regulations that will be imposed by laws set by the government. ie. it wil be centralized, and de-anonimized.

It wil be just another fiat currency like any other flawed and failing currency. 

With that the purpose for which Bitcoin was created wil be taken from it. It wil then crash, be abandoned, in favor of another coin which is truely anonimous and decentralized. Not Eth or anything based on that.

A regulatory threat would be a new unrealized gains tax on Bitcoin, which would be devastating to long-term savers. They could try to marginalize Bitcoin by introducing a competitor: a Central Bank Digital Currency. Another vector could be a ban on the act of Bitcoin mining itself inside democracies. Today, many mainstream media articles describe Bitcoin as an environmental disaster. 

The Chinese Communist Party restricted the ability of its citizens to exchange RMB for Bitcoin. Shortly thereafter, the Indian government did the same, followed by the Pakistani government and several others. In other words, the two largest governments in the world tried to cut off Bitcoin access to their citizenry at the most obvious point: the on and off ramps where citizens exchange local currency for Bitcoin through exchanges.

Hanzburger,"It's such a horrible example and allow me to explain. The argument is that some entity can just buy up a bunch of ETH to control the network. First off, the more they control the more the price would move up and the more expensive the attack becomes as they increase their supply. 

Second, this is no different than some entity putting that money towards buying miners to attack bitcoin. People act like it's more impossible to setup warehouses of miners than 51% ETH. Let's assume the market isn't moved at all, it would cost $100B (50% of market cap). While a 51% mining attack on bitcoin would cost [$720k per hour](https://www.crypto51.app/). Not to mention you'd get to keep attacking the network once you own the mining equipment rather than losing that investment as would happen with Ethereum PoS.

Third, to address their nonsense about spiraling costs of an attack since the security is directly tied to the price of ETH, this isn't very different than how it works with Bitcoin. When the price of bitcoin drops, so does the hashrate, because it's less profitable to mine and not worth it. People shutting off their miners increases your share of the hash rate making the network cheaper to attack, and vice versa in the other direction.

This double speak is all too common where people say something is an issue in another chain and ignore it the other way around. Ethereum PoS will be even more secure than Bitcoin PoW, plain and simple.",gqxunra,2021-03-15 05:37:05,8

My school of thought is have 3 months bills (mortgage/rent, cell, food gas, utilities) in liquid cash in your bank account as an emergency fund.

Right now a coin is worth around 6,000,000 cents, which fluctuates mostly with the cost of energy to generate them.

Nuclear_rabbit,"Let's do some evil math. The last time I saw this headline posted (and much of this comment is copied from what I said there), someone calculated as if teachers were glorified babysitters, and used the figure of $3.25 per student per hour.

Let's be even more severe. A teacher has (let's assume, because we are evil admins) only five class hours a day, the rest is spent on planning.

We will also consider the number of students to be a ""bulk discount."" The prophet of finance, Dave Ramsey, once posted on his blog that bulk buying toilet paper netted a 22.6% discount. And since toilet paper in a pandemic is about the value of a bitcoin, we can model covid-era toilet paper to be the same value as a child on the dark web. Thus, we can use the 22.6% discount when bulk buying children.

We evil admins all know that classrooms only 30 children. There's no way we'd cram 42 in one room ever.

Although the school year differs in some districts, I grew up in one that was only 180 days per year.

So instead of $3.25 per student per hour, we have $2.52 per student per hour times 5 hours a day times 30 students per hour times 180 days per year. That comes to...

$68,040.

It turns out $70,000 really is reasonable even when you make absurdly evil assumptions.",gqyn4xt,2021-03-15 09:14:56,10

Based on revenue projections of the number of Bitcoin and Ethereum mined by SOS’s soon to be operational 15,000 mining rigs, and comparables from Marathon Digital Holdings, symbol MARA and Riot Blockchain, symbol RIOT, it appears that the value of SOS shares have been severely harmed from the short seller allegations.

VictorCobra,"I just wrote [a new analysis](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/LTCBTC/AINdMwgV-The-LTC-BTC-Conundrum/) on the LTC/BTC pair. It's interesting to me because it seems as if whales are constantly dumping coins on the Bitcoin pair (looking at on-balance volume). Meanwhile, institutions and retail are buying on the USD pair (looking at grayscale and Coinbase). 

If the ratio is to go up, I think it'll come from the USD pair first, and the buying momentum from retail would be enough to break through the sell pressure on the Bitcoin pair. Just some thoughts! 

For some context, I accumulated my first Litecoin in early 2019 at $32, and sold it all for ETH and some other alts near 0.5 on the LTC/ETH ratio. I began accumulating again after selling all my XRP at $0.47 for LTC at $110. Then I doubled my LTC allocation with some ETH at 0.09 on the LTC/ETH ratio. Patiently waiting now.

The current climate for crypto, to me at least, feels different than ever before. Rather than the unabashed mania that washed over the world in 2017, this market feels like a consistent and natural maturation of the crypto sphere. 

Good, bad, or other, huge corporations are buying in to the idea of crypto. Yes, Bitcoin is the main benefactor, currently; however, a rising sea brings everyone up. As fresh capital floods into crypto, confidence builds, projects advance, and values increase. 

I for one think these are the first fledgling steps towards the inevitable future. Will Bitcoin replace the USD? I’d be an fool to give a definitive “yes”, but will Bitcoin, and crypto as a whole, become a legitimate store of value... yes. 

Again, personal opinion here, but I feel as though we in this sub are among the vanguard of the future of finance. I understand that sounds hyperbolic, but I truly believe it. Gigantic corporations are scrambling to invest in Bitcoin, crypto ETFs are springing up everywhere, and we are all exactly where we need to be. All we have to do at this point is wait.

Merlin560,"[Macro Econ update.]

Just to remind folks, the Fed releases its minutes today.  What you should be looking for is their forecast on the interest rates and predicted rate hikes.  If these move up the stock market will shit a brick.  If they don’t move up, bond market will think them insane, and it will react.

Also look for a decision on SLR limits.  This is the reserve levels that big banks must maintain—and how Treasuries are counted.  Exemptions for both started at the beginning of COVID and are scheduled to expire at the end of March.  An extension wouldn’t have a huge impact.  An unwinding of the rules will inject cash in the market looking for a home.  The problem is that there are not many hospitable places for that cash to go.

So, this afternoon “could” range from a relief rally to absolute shit show.  And this all impacts Bitcoin because of stock prices, margin calls, and people search for yield.

And the people flailing around are not going to be Reddit Apes, but NY, London, and Hong Kong, King Kong monsters.

john_r365,"&gt;what are some potentials for further market exposure of XMR given several large platforms are anti-privacy?

Not sure I understand?

Is the question something like - given that some exchanges such as Gemini and Coinbase do not list Monero - what are some other ways that Monero could grow its userbase and price?

If so, a couple thoughts of the top of my head:

* People can buy other coins using fiat on-ramps, then trade them into Monero. So the mechanism exists to get Monero, the main thing is whether or not the organic demand will increase. We don't necessarily need Bitcoin &lt;&gt; Monero atomic swaps to exist.
* Demand could increase a number of ways, including:
   * Education - as more people get introduced to crypto and learn more about it, they may learn the pros and cons of coins like Bitcoin - and see the inherent value in things like privacy and fungibility - leading them to monero.
   * Influencers - Currently Bitcoin has influencers like Anthony Pompliano, Andreas Antonopolous, Jack Dorsey, Michael Saylor etc talking highly of Bitcoin. Monero doesn't really have the same kind of thing - but that could change.
   * Utility - people are gradually learning about digital privacy and the need for it. Monero provides privacy preserving technology, and so it's likely that as privacy online continues to erode, the utility for Monero will increase.",gr962ck,2021-03-18 01:49:27,18

After promising to get a Doge tattoo once she reached 50,000 retweets on Twitter, Instagram influencer Corinna Kopf has finally followed through on the challenge after an intervention from Elon Musk.


Social media is a powerful place, and plenty of creators and influencers have left their fate in the hands of thousands of Twitter users in the past, often setting a certain amount of likes or retweets as a goal that decides whether they will have to do a challenge or not.

Back in January Instagram influencer and gamer Corinna Kopf decided that she would get a ‘DogeCoin’ tattoo if she reached 50,000 retweets after it became particularly popular around that time.

DogeCoin is a cryptocurrency inspired by the viral Shiba Inu ‘Doge’ meme, initially introduced back in 2013, but experienced a surge in popularity in 2021.

Corinna appeared to hit her goal relatively early on according to one Twitter user who said, “it hit 50k right at the start and she didn’t do it, she’s only in it for clout,” alongside an image that showed she had reached the goal she suggested.

This was in response to a thread on March 24 where Corinna said if Elon Musk followed her she would buy “one bitcoin.”

That then led to Elon Musk himself replying to the disgruntled Twitter user who called Corinna out for not following through on getting the tattoo, with Elon saying, “you raise a good point haha.”

Elon’s tweet seemed to prompt the influencer to finally get the tattoo, as she revealed in a tweet on March 26, the word ‘Doge’ inked in an unusual place.




Corinna tagged the Tesla CEO in a reply to the tweet, but it’s unclear whether or not he’s seen the new tattoo.

Regardless, he seemed to have been the person to finally convince the star to follow through on her promise, and fans are impressed that she’s actually done it.",gsowr5t,2021-03-29 23:39:50,1

JustMyTwoSatoshis,"In the state I live in, almost nothing got permanently closed, and life feels pretty much normal except that working from home has been normalized (thank god) and wearing masks in public places. Some things won't go back to how they were, like working from home being normalized, and that's fine. Don't fear change. Most things will go back to normal.

&gt;But it's a sobering thought: betting on BTC is shorting our whole way of life.

What? How? This is such a ridiculous reach but it's nothing new. People were saying things like ""For bitcoin to reach $10,000, we'd all be living in cardboard boxes"" since 2010.

Yes, bitcoin (and even robinhood) for that matter have given people the ability and desire to invest and not just stack cash under their mattress. Bitcoin has literally taught me how to save money. That's a good thing.

The big lie you've been taught your whole life is that consumption has to continue at full speed and that frugality is anti-capitalism. People still act like ""jobs"" is the metric that matters. Yes, people need to have positive direction and motivation to contribute to society. No, that doesn't mean that if someone doesn't have a job, they can't do that. All sorts of jobs are moving to automation. That's a good thing. 40 hour work weeks will be a thing of the past soon, and for many of us, they already are. 

It's going to be an interesting transition to a society where frugality is encouraged, consumption is no longer the fuel that makes the world spin, and we actually have to find ways to keep people engage with society in a positive way without having to work 40 hours a week to barely afford rent at their mom's house. Many people will go into this new world kicking and screaming. I can't imagine a futuristic, peaceful society where ""jobs"" is the metric we give a shit about instead of minimum quality of life.",gspvl5q,2021-03-30 04:05:07,12

Jest samotny, szuka ""bratniej duszy"". Zaczynacie sobie gadać, wymieniać się zdjęciami i nagle... snujecie plany wspólnego życia.

Misja dobiega końca, żołnierzyk ma wracać i... zostaje pobity przez czarnodupian. Ląduje w szpitalu i... rząd US nie chce płacić za leczenie. Nie chce też przekazać wypłaty. Prosi Ciebie o drobną pomoc finansową, którą spłaci szybko. Faktycznie spłaca.

Dochodzi do siebie, już wraca. Na lotnisku widzi bociany lecące z Polski, już wie, że zaraz będzie u ukochanej. Wtem bóg/czarnodupianie/rząd US sprawiają, że pozostaje bez pieniędzy.

Na szczęście wystarczy wykonać sprytny manewr i rząd US zapłaci. Musisz podać się za żonę żołnierza, wysłać zdjęcie do afrykańskiego banku, potwierdzić konto płatnością bitcoin i rząd US przekieruje pieniążki.

Pieniążków nie ma, bo trzeba potwierdzić kartę płatniczą, a ta wymaga weryfikacji przez przelew. Ponownie płacisz. Pieniądze już są tylko, że... pobili syna żołnierza i musi je szybko przekazać na lecznie i potrzebuje trochę kasy...

Proof of Stake is where you can lock in your ATOMs into the protocol (this is simplified) and are rewarded for securing the blockchain with ATOMs. As opposed to Proof of Work where miners use hash rate to compete with each other to discover the next block, securing the network through computational power. 

Now, keeping your coins in coinbase (not your keys, not your crypto), you aren’t actually personally locking in your coins into the staking protocol. Coinbase is doing this on your behalf and paying you a fixed APY as advertised.",gsqu158,2021-03-30 08:43:34,13

After the next halving and when you see bitcoin rising again, start looking out for brand new alts full of promise and buy them up cheap. Many will 100x or more. When bitcoin is near the next top, sell everything again and repeat above. 
  
This is what I plan to do and is based on what happened in the past. Holding alts over a bear marketis a very bad idea. Most never recover and those that appearto actually never are as competitive as if you had just brought bitcoin and held. The value of alts is in buying the new shit, waiting for the irrational rise and selling.

I haven’t posted for a couple of days because nothing much of note was going on.

Today we continued up the column of Xs from the Low Pole of the weekend.  Today we met the local resistance coming down from the previous column’s high.  This means if we get through this box, we should hit a break out and then onto a new ATH.

Good for us.

At the same time, if we reverse down to $57,361 before moving up we will continue the formation.  That would not be horrible as it extends its width meaning the next move up would be nice.  The next breakdown would suck…on the other hand.

Here are the numbers for the day:

1.  The formation is 9 columns wide.

2. **@ $59,691 we would match the previous three high boxes.**  That would create a solid triple top.  In PnF charting this is actually pretty good.

3. **If we break out, it would be a triple top break out.  That happens at $60,288.**  A Triple Top Break out is a significant positive move and we should see a move into the mid $60’s without a lot of resistance.

4. Local support is way down the line at **$51,400.**

5. The trend line today is still at $19,780.  I think we are safe from a trend reversal today!  

It appears that we are holding the $58,700 level right now.  The PayPal news hasn’t sent us to the moon, but I think it’s keeping us up.  That is good.

So, look at the your breakout spots and get ready for some fun.

(PS:  I took my month end ""harvest"" today.  That is when I cull a percentage of the monthly gain and re-allocated it in my portfolio...and add it my ""truck fund.""  Traditionally, this happens and the price goes up.  This has been the case since October.

satoshisbitcoin,"I recently started to experiment with small sums in blockfi and gemini and came to the following realization through the process. 

Bitcoin's available supply is going to decrease at a faster rate as options to earn money on bitcoin instead of selling it become safer and more accessible. 

In prior bull runs the only way for a holder to realize gains was to sell X amount of your stack. Some might sell everything in a bull market, some might sell a few percent, but in all cases some amount of held coins would be released back into supply. 

Now with lending programs it is possible to ""cash out"" by putting some percentage of your stack to earn interest, which has the advantage of not reducing your stack or incurring capital gains taxes. Again some might transfer all of their coins to blockfi and others only a few percent, but the overall point is the need to sell coins and release them back into circulation has been reduced and will be further reduced over time. 

What this means is bitcoin will convert from a speculation game where a lot of people invest for timeframes less than 10 years and look for capital appreciation, into an accumulation game where a large number of investors will be primarily interested in acquiring and growing the size of their stack. The impact of this can not be understated since bitcoin is already a scarce asset and this will cause it to become even scarcer.

This reinforces my belief that this epoch will track more closely to the 2012/13 run than the 2017 run.",gsuk1eq,2021-03-31 06:49:28,22

zluckdog,"Hey there. So you have this trading plan and it includes a liquidation level that could easily be hit. You might think bitcoin won't go below 50k again but all it takes is one wick and your loosing almost a quarter of a bitcoin. If you can afford that, it is your money, Do what you want. But first, consider the following:

Did you hear the story of [LowPro](https://www.tradingview.com/u/Low%20Pro/)? He felt pretty smart, built up an account valued over 100k trading bitcoin. When the market suddenly changed direction he kept longing and got liquidated back in 2014. 

He could have been a bitcoin millionaire if he didn't get greedy and gamble away his portfolio. Because that is what he really did. He gambled, rather then employ proper risk management. He kept revenge trading, instead of taking some time to cool off and re-evaluate his trading plan. 

So if you are posting here to get advice, listen to it. Be smart with your money because if you play recklessly, you will end up wrecked. Exchanges can spike down or up without warning. Changes happen faster then plans.",gsxr0ue,2021-04-01 02:37:08,12

I didn't hodl a single sat. Multiple whole coins got smoked. Even my friend who bought 3 or 5 coins to sit on spent them on drugs eventually too. We aren't all that versed in financial literacy and have never said the word ""fiat"" or ""deflationary digit asset"". We wanted acid shrooms and weed and we got them.

Ray Dalio made a video back in Sept 2020 explaining how scarce assets make great stores of value and started to accumulate in October at 12.2k a coin. I discovered Michael Saylor and Cathy Wood and my desire to educate myself grew 100000x

Bitcoin really altered my whole life philosophy. I was super burnt out from work and was disgusted with Academia to the point where I just wanted to leave my country. Now I'm more inclined to invest in myself, build a nest egg and actually have a plan that extends beyond the 8 hrs in front of me.

A 5 year hodl plan is the first time in my life I've got a long term goal I can believe in. All I've gotta do is nothing and I succeed.

That's a misunderstanding of how Bitcoin works.

You can run the whole economy on 1 BCH if you need to.

It just means the value of a satoshi (or whatever is the smallest unit then) will increase.

However ... no-one is saying the fee-burning will last forever or anything.

Short term, increasing scarcity through such a mechanism might be a very good thing for BCH to secure more hashrate (increase scarcity, increase price, mining profitability goes up a little, hashrate follows profitability).

Wonderful_Fig_4882,"Don't be! I started to buy bitcoin last year and felt the same. Earlier this year I did the research and added Binance, Filecoin, and Theta. Then everything except Bitcoin started to drop. When it came back a little bit, I sold Binance, Filecoin, and Theta. Recently I realised that I made a big mistake. Patience and the mental resistance to pressure is needed. I bought back Binance, then it started to drop again, I waited, it rises up again, and the return is better than Bitcoin. 

And now I regretted that I sold Filecoin and Theta earlier this year. Hodl. It will come back up. The return of Filecoin last year till now was around 4000%, Theta 12,000%. Even if this year is not as good, it will be at least 4-5 times more till the end of 2021 (very conservative estimation). So hodl, to you and to me.",gt64don,2021-04-03 04:09:49,2

No need to stock product, no supply chain issues, not much in terms of wages.

bitusher,"&gt;  cost of mining adjusts based on the amount to be gained in order to make sure mining is always profitable?

The protocol itself (without human intervention) automatically adjusts based upon the previous difficulty period 

New Difficulty = Old Difficulty * (Actual Time of Last 2015 Blocks / 20160 minutes or about every 2 weeks on average) 

If the Hashrate increases during the previous period than the difficulty increases to regulate the amount of Bitcoin mined. If the hashrate decreases during the previous period the difficulty also decreases (mining gets easier) to insure mining is profitable and the inflation schedule is relatively accurate.

You don't actually own any bitcoin, so if you walked into a Tesla dealership one day to buy a car you'd have to pay the old fashioned way and two you're going to get taxed on your capital gains.

The ETFs allow you to put it into a TFSA or RSP and purchasing/trading for BTC yourself (and ideally keeping in a secure wallet which you control) means you actually own the BTC itself. The option on WS is kind of the worst of both worlds IMO. Also most people who sell their BTC probably don't pay taxes (this is changing) where as WS will leave you a nice paper trail where you'll have no choice.

If you're going to trust a 3rd party to hold your coins just buy through Shakepay or some other insured Canadian 3rd Party and at least you actually own the crypto and can send it off platform if need be.

holytoledo760,"I feel like the biggest mistake the US government made in trying to run an Ag and Au monetary system was the lock in of pricing and eventual runs that provoked. 

Nowadays, given that systems like the internet exist and the populace is accustomed to fluctuating prices for any given thing (stocks, bitcoin, toilet paper), I think a gold system could work. 

The idea being that any new large findings of veins like what happened in Africa would be curtailed by the ooh shiny aspect of gold. Like a niffler, you can bet someone will hoard it. And I think it ties inflation down to a more real number. Eventually we'll trade in gold dust but the economy will be solid AND honest. As is, the money presses were/are used for war. Something like less than ten percent at the federal level goes to public welfare.

Adrian-X,"&gt; What's your solution that gives privacy to the people but not to governments?

Bitcoin as in the protocol of the last 10 years is pseudo anonymous. I'm suggesting exploiting that to maximize privacy. 

Don't attache your name to an address unless it is necessary, we must fight to prevent governments mandating you do this. Coin mixers, I think could encourage governments to mandate such laws, that would erode privacy.   

If you manage your coins appropriately you can maintain your privacy. One way to think about it is like Digital Cash spending a $10,000.00 vs spending a $10.00. you get better privacy is you have 1,000 $10 bills than 1 $10,000 bill. Also don't mix your change if you spend 100 $10 bills on coffee and then consolidate the change to buy a gun then coin analysts of gun purchase can conclude all the coffee transactions were you. 

blockchair.com have codified this analysts technique and you can see your privacy score when you query an address. 

The government works in reverse, we all pay our tax into a single government address, we can then track how the government spends our money and hold them to account. any government spending that can't be accounted for is and should be illegal. 

&gt;And how do you currently know all the terrible things governments are doing?

I don't, I just see news reports of Donald Rumsfeld, on September 10th say ""we've lost $2,000,000,000,000 actually we spent it on weapons but we don't know where they went, and then on September 11th all the offices of the investigators are destroyed.  

I see that same government lie about weapons of mass destruction to justify an unprovoked invasion, 

I see the US military dropping bombs full of depleted uranium on Afghanistan, a country devastated by a war funded by the US and then accused of attacking the US without any evidence presented.  

I see the the financial system being abused by people in power, creating money out of thin air and accelerating wealth inequality as the money is invested in the wealthy at the expense of the poor. 

I see governments eroding people freedoms. 

&gt;Are you calling up the banks and asking where government-spent funds are going?

LOL, no Governments are not held to account. I don't want to call up anyone, I want natural law cause and effect to prevail. I just want the right to not be forced to consent.",gtcvo0m,2021-04-05 00:57:14,1

It's morally false politics just as DDosing is morally false technical tactics. You guys couldn't take the success of XT at the time. You would do anything it takes to get your minority way.

squaredk2,"Check out this [g trends chart](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=Ethereum,Bitcoin) for worldwide usage of the search term ""ethereum"" vs. ""Bitcoin"". Make sure you view 5 year chart.  

From ~may-setp 2017 we were spiking in terms of search volume. The price then was surging past $100 and bouncing around between roughly $250-$350 with peaks and bottoms. Now notice the peak. Search volume was highest around dec 3rd - 23rd, but in that time, eth ""only"" climbed from $500-$700... it hit its all time high during the following month...    

Let's compare that to now. Where are we along the chart in comparison to 2017? Well, imo, we are moving faster. Of course the charts will not be identical, but my guess is that the 6 month long rush in search traffic from 2017 may-oct is similar to the search traffic we have seen in just the past 3 months. In 2017 you'll notice two dips, one bottom in early July and next early oct. Both 3 full months apart. In 2020 the bottoms are only 2 months apart. End of jan and another at the end of march.   

If my thesis is accurate at all, Aprils chart will match the one from November through December 2017. Talking spike in search traffic here... we will have a spike in price a week or so following.  

 As soon as we see a major spike in search traffic, people will be signing up for coinbase etc. A week or so later they will be investing, and thats when I will likley exit 90%+ of my position.

Now users are incentivized to keep their BTC where they bought it (without moving it).

so now we can no longer be sure there are 21M BTCs that can ever be made - so there goes the gentleman's first point.

Since not everyone in the world can be on the same exchange and some exchanges legally cannot interact with others - there goes the idea that you can send BTC to anyone, anywhere, anytime.

Now the security of the held BTC is as secure as the competency of the security team at the exchange...that is to say absolute zero!!  All exchanges have and will be hacked at some point - sometimes its even an inside job.

CrabCommander,"Here's a quick BTC ***Bull Run Health Report*** (by Indicator) for those curious:

Keep in mind, all indicators are only accurate until they are not, and some are simply generated with back-dated values to find numbers that coincidentally seem to fit the markets.

Furthermore, keep in mind these are metrics for ***Bitcoin***, not alts, though they tend to follow BTC's movements.

**Bullish:**

- The [BTC Stock/Flow Model](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/stock-to-flow-model/) suggests this bull run has a bit to even reach the new 'bear market floor' price point, with quite a bit beyond that to reach a bull market peak.

- The [BTC Rainbow Chart](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/) suggests we are quite some distance from a serious bubble, and only slightly overbought currently.

- The [BTC Net Unrealized Profit/Loss Indicator](https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&amp;m=indicators.NetUnrealizedProfitLoss) suggests there's a good bit of unrealized profit in the system, but not so much that a crash is imminent, with more room to grow before the 'danger zone'.

- The [BTC Reserve Risk Indicator](https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&amp;m=indicators.ReserveRisk) puts us about bang even in the middle of things.  The risk is neither particularly high nor low, and is notably far, far lower than periods where the market crashed.

**Bearish:**

- The [BTC Pi Cycle Indicator](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/pi-cycle-top-indicator/) suggests this is the top of the bull run (likely within the next 1-2 days, though it's been stuck at 'almost converging' for a week or more now.)

Sentiment definitely looks overall bullish, though it's a bit tied between 'set for another run', or if it'll be stagnant a bit/minor sell of first before going for another run.",gti9o9g,2021-04-06 07:52:34,13

Destreich,"I've been in crypto since 2013. I was in college and a friend of mine told me about these thing called Bitcoin (and how it was going to make us rich), and I ended up buying some. I lost 90% of my stack day trading alts in 2014 (back then they were pretty much all just Bitcoin clones, and Litecoin was still a pretty neat idea), but I held the rest. Back in 2013-14 people mostly thought I was an idiot for throwing so much money into Bitcoin (""it's a ponzi scheme; it has no value; what, are you going to buy drugs on the silk road with it?""), but I didn't listen to them.

I got involved in the space again in 2017. That year I traded all my Bitcoin for Ethereum, because I saw the writing on the wall that this was the future of crypto. Around this time I began to realize that this technology will literally change the world, and now it's clear that DeFi has the potential to bring the equity and transparency to the financial services sector that is sorely needed.

Four years after trading in my BTC for ETH, this investment has taken me to a point, not of being totally FIRE, but of being financially independent enough to really follow my dreams. I'm quitting my job at a fintech firm at the end of the month, bought a van to travel the country with, and I'll be joining a Buddhist center for a few months later this summer.

I say all this to express my deep gratitude for the amazing people driving this space forward. Crypto has attained a level of legitimacy that just wasn't there eight years ago, but it's clear that this is still to a degree a niche thing to be involved in.

Desperate_Tangerine_,"
Quick disclaimer: I’m off work early today, had two drinks, and and feeling good so please excuse any typos. 

This post isn’t in regards to any coin, or token, but rather, the holders thereof. You the individual. 

Here’s to hoping each of you are well on your way to financial freedom. I don’t have a large amount of crypto, I actually probably have a pretty meager amount compared to most of you, but it’s growing, and one day I hope to retire from it. 

I know this message sounds like overly optimistic hyperbole, but I honestly feel like we are on the precipice of something great, and we are all party to it. 

At some point, every one of us has FOMO’d, invested more than we probably should have, chased pumps, and panic dumped. We are here now though, and the winds are shifting. Will Bitcoin replace the USD? Probably not, but will it become a legitimate store of wealth for corporate treasuries and wealthy individuals alike? I think yes. All we have to do is watch. The dominos have been set in motion, the fuse lit. The increase in value rapidly approaching. 

Our stumbles along the way should be of no concern, because we are all poised to watch crypto do something great. A decade from now, I for one hope every person currently on this sub looks back to now with nostalgia and just a twinge of longing. Make no mistake, we are in the “good old days” right now, and for this moment, now 3 drinks in, I’m going to cherish it.

Mr. Cuban once said that he would rather have bananas than Bitcoin, so I never thought he would come around to Eth. But the thing is, Eth has an entire ecosystem built on top of it that offer many various use cases. In addition to this, Eth as an asset is hardening and with EIP-1559 &amp; POS. It's going to be harder and harder to justify the argument that BTC is superior to Eth.

Eth will have lower issuance (potential to be deflationary during times of high volume)

Eth will use drastically less energy with POS

Eth doesn't incentivise selling to offset mining costs from POW, rather the contrary with POS.

1supercooldude,"Use Gemini. It's the cheapest for fees and withdrawals. (I've spent a lot of time researching this) 

If u want ur coins secured get a physical wallet such as ledger or trezor. I think most major exchanges are secure, but there is that always 1% chance. (I am in the cyber security field).

Gemini has lending on stablecoins such as DAI. DAI is practically backed 1:1 to USD. I converted much of what my bank has into DAI and have it earning interest. Gemini will give you 7.4% APY. I personally use Celcius which gives me 10.51%. MUCH BETTER than the 0.15% APY my savings account gives me. 

The rest I invested into crypto I trust. **Please read their whitepapers** before investing. Know what you're getting yourself into and if you can see a future of the crypto. I personally like projects such as ADA, BCH, ETC, BAT. 

I invest lum sums to get it over with. I check charts and will plan my entry and it might take a week or a month to get there. I'll DCA if I get more money. 

Only advice is to keep all ur secret keys and passwords on paper. Never share with anyone. Never upload to you Icloud with a screenshot. And never tell how people how much $ you have in crypto! These are basic rules in crypto. 

Also, have a plan. Do you need an exit plan in case things go down? How much are you willing to lose? Do you plan to hold for 5 years? (If you plan to hold it might be better to buy and delete the app or you will sell out of fear lol)

If you want to research more please do BEFORE investing. There are many apps that do the same, but the ones I mentioned I personally vetted to be safe and secure. You may have different tastes and needs though and prefer another exchange, wallet, etc...

Arghmybrain,"Info about dips.

While crypto is a new market, it's really not that different from stock markets. It behaves a little more eratically and at faster speeds, but it's largely the same. As it matures more, you see the lines move more in sync with the stock market as many of the same investors enter both and both are subject to random events happening in the world.

What you can see in the stock market history is that no line ever goes up perfectly straight. You'll find little dips often, a jagged line. This is absolutely 100% normal behavior. No line is smooth, and the more you zoom in, the more you'll see just how jagged it is.

People do largely invest with emotion. Fomo, fud are really big. Momentum is huge in investment. Momentum stops, you will see a dip. The stronger the upwards movement was before that, the stronger the dip will usually be. People take profits, whales sell, there's some fud going on and it goes down until the market stabilizes. The crypto market is currently strongly tied to bitcoin, so bitcoin moving down shakes trust in the market and triggers bot sales. Bitcoin will often be the catalyst for a dip.

Market stabilizes simply by enough people going ""Hey, let's buy some more, I feel it's low enough to increase my holdings!"" and then the market starts moving sideways for some time. 

With enough trust in the market and some newly started momentum, there will be another pump. And that pump too will be followed by some dipping.

Obviously we can't tell when a dip is just a dip or might turn into more, but dips by themselves aren't anything to be concerned about. It's just healthy market movement that is always going to happen. Nothing is ever going to change that. It's really just the market attempting to build support levels and balance itself out strongly.",gtpzmsc,2021-04-08 04:09:18,17

2. No, bitcoin has entered a super-cycle. i.e. escape velocity from deep crash has been achieved this cycle due to things like deep institutional buyers, more sophisticated infra, incentives to hodl, etc.
3. There will be a draw down but not as bad as 80-90% crash. i.e. the price of bitcoin will go down \~50-60%, but not as bad as previous cycles.

Energy consumption is also a non-issue. Firstly, energy consumption != pollution. Energy consumption is what separates us from cavemen. The problem is carbon based fuels, not energy. BTC is already predominantly mined by renewable and excess energy and it has been trending more in that direction over time. 

In either case, people actually don’t give a shit about carbon emissions, otherwise you’d see a lot more mopeds and priuses than SUVs and trucks.

* With 16.7k comments in the daily, nearing its 18k ath, the bull is clearly not at an end yet. Because the daily comments amount predicts it all!
* The market cap settles at 1.88t, which is a hefty 5% drop from the day before. Tears are found aplenty.
* Daddy bitcoin acts like a toddler again and throws a temper tantrum. But being all big and mighty, it actually causes damage.
* ETH crashes all the way down below 2k. Comments of ""when ETH 2k"" have appeared once more.
* BNB dives down to 375. CZ's tears double total of /r/cc tears.
* ADA falls below 1.20. ADA history says that they won't recover above 1.20 anytime soon.
* BCH lost all its momentum and crashed down to 616. Mourning period will start once it moves back up.
* FIL fell below 140 but actually recovered a lot of it and now trying to touch the 160 region again.
* VET held above 10 cents.
* BTT crashed down below 0.8 cents. Which is 0.7 cents above expectations.
* WIN moves down further as well, losing another 15%.
* Tron still sits at rank 5 in total volume.
* AAVE figured being below 350 feels better.
* ATOM lost 20+ area once more. You held on as strongly as you could, fella!
* On Coingecko we see a newcomer at rank 69. FEI. FEI is a new type of stablecoin that I, of course, do not understand. CMC decided not to allow it in the top 100.
* ENJ sees a large increase in mentions as it decided to get up and walk some miles. ENJ holders are very happy.
* Other than ENJ, coins like LTO, MOON, VET, ONE and FUD are mentioned a whole lot. FUD is a coin that always seems to spike hard when the market goes red. I know little about it.
* ENJ, WRX and CEL are the top 100 gainers of the day with 15-12% up. Which is pathetic... but since we're red I guess it's pretty solid. ETC with another 10% gain is one that deserves a mention. Making son ETH proud once more.
* On the loser side we see BTT with 19% as biggest loser. CRO and NEM with 18% follow up closely. Which is pretty solid considering the market is red.
* Looking into the top 500 we see a few huge gainers. At the top of these is Bitcoin Diamond with almost 90% up. NKN with 50% is second and at third spot we have KMD with 43%. Niche mention OGN also rises with 28%. N8V makes another appearance with 250% up and $28 volume.
* On the loser side we see META with 40% down, IGNIS with 36% down and RFR with 35% down.

Darvian_Empire,"1. Marketcap doesn't mean how much money is actually in the crypto. It merely means current price multiplied by circulating supply. A $10 trillion marketcap coin could literally have only $1 billion actual money in it.
2. XRP traded in the $0.006 range for a couple of years, just like VET. In Dec. 2017, XRP went to $3.40.
3. There is much more money in the market today than there was in Dec. 2017. With historic stimulus worldwide comes historic inflation worldwide. People are scrambling to protect their wealth, which is why we seen GrayScale, Blackrock, MicroStrategy, J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, etc. 'FOMO' into Bitcoin.
4. These are investment institutions and they're going to offer their clients what they believe is going to offer the most opportunity to everyone. With the insane real world adoption VeChain is enjoying and with VeChain being 20+/- on marketcap lists, you can be sure that VeChain has been noticed, researched and is on the lists of some of these world class investment institutions.
5. Vechain is playing out in a similar manner as XRP did in 2017. However, VeChain is doing better. It not only has the attention of world class enterprises, it's also safe to assume they have the attention of world class investment institutions. We're talking about multiple multi-billion dollar behemoths who have a very strong interest in seeing the price grow as much as possible.

MotCADK,Agreed. Bitcoin represents a distrust of fiat currency. The DTCC should be worried that a similar thing will happen to stocks. Maybe companies should issue cryptocurrency redeemable for stocks. That would render the DTCC obsolete real quick.,gtuls6k,2021-04-09 05:01:59,31
GameWithVish,"My portfolio is currently 90% GME and 10% crypto; I've also started dabbling with binance futures with bitcoin. So far, doubled my crypto investments and been making like $100-$500 per day on binance futures. After GME, I'm definitely going 100% in crypto. It's the future and currently only like 2% of retail investors/public are in crypto. Once shit hits the fan and the vast majority of ppl start piling onto the crypto scene, you'll never see a crypto in the pennies again. This is literally the very beginning of the crypto scene - start getting in and learning now.

GetYourAssToPluto,"**1.68 million**

Some points of global comparison:

* 66% use a mobile phone 
 
* 59% are internet users

* 53% are active on a social network

* 1% are crypto owners

CMelody,"Here are a few things that lead me to think Zola is the PB:

1. When we last saw Zola, he had become an artificial intelligence after uploading his consciousness into a computer network.  Although the computers were destroyed, he could have escaped online.
2. Selby in the comics was a mutant who could speak to computers.  The perfect henchman for a virtual being.
3. The bounty on the heroes for killing Selby was posted online in seconds, which an AI could easily accomplish.  The bounty was offered in Bitcoin - virtual currency, something an AI might easily manipulate and control.
4. The “Power Broker is Watching“ mural in Madripoor contains two sets of eyes.  I have seen Marvel concept art of Zola’s robot shell where it had two faces, the one in the torso and a robot head above it.  I think the big boss battle will be the heroes against Robot Zola.
5. Bucky’s arc this series seems to be about proving to himself that he is no longer the Winter Soldier.  Zola turned him into the Winter Soldier, so defeating him would be symbolic of fully regaining his own faculties and shedding his past.  And Zemo is also trying to destroy Hydra and everyone capable of creating super soldiers, so Zemo defeating Zola fits into his narrative as well.",gtvs90m,2021-04-09 10:42:12,13

The first two of those do not apply to Binance. BNB is no different than any Bitcoin fork that was used to raise funding.

I don't use Binance and have no interest in it either way other then from an ideological standpoint (centralization bad). But I can't see how it doesn't come under scrutiny from the SEC in time.",gtyi3wz,2021-04-10 03:16:03,15

zbullet99,"#####I might transfer all of my holdings into Litecoin soon.

#####Allow me to explain why.
* I have been following Litecoins decline on the ratio for sometime now, I think all of us ratio traders have. It is easy to look at the charts and see the ratio has been in a long downtrend. Looking at the weekly, you can see it has been on the way down [since Feb - 2018.](https://imgur.com/gallery/gk3ieMZ)

#####So when do we get to the good part?
* [Gunga galunga... gunga, gunga-lagunga](https://imgur.com/gallery/YHHnZXX)

* USD value is great for people who rely on bitcoin to do all of the heavy lifting for Chikun. But we want to see Chikun spread it's wings and fly on its own. To do that, we need to look at the ratio for help. It feels like every other week we see a spike in the downtrend and that brings a little hope, but it always crashes back down and continues the downtrend. I think we are all asking ourselves the same question every week...

#####When will the ratio recover?! When moon?
* Every week you will see someone say the same thing... 2 weeks. It is almost a meme at this point that in 2 weeks we will see something big happen. Then it never does. 
* [Well....](https://imgur.com/gallery/zA4tqwr)

#####Alright, so why are the next few weeks so important?
* To answer this, we need to take a closer look at the LTC/BTC charts.
* Quick explanation of moving averages: I often use Moving Averages to help find patterns and determine when to buy/sell. A moving average is just what it sounds like, an average of the value over a set period of time (Most commonly 50, 100 and 200). These are based on whatever timeframe you are looking at. If it is the daily chart, then we can see a 50-day moving average line and so on. For the following pictures: Green = 50. Orange = 100. Blue = 200.
* Looking at the daily, it appears that Litecoin has been trying to get above the 200-day moving average (blue line) for quite a long time. [This is the past year of attempts and failures](https://imgur.com/gallery/a6dAjeh)

#####This is not helping, WHEN MOON?!
* What's that old saying? oh yeah, When in doubt ZOOM OUT.
* [Looking at the weekly for the past 2 years,](https://imgur.com/gallery/Mg4dVBi) you can see the downtrend has started to get closer to the 50 week moving average line (green line) but gets pushed back below the 20-week moving average (small white line) after every attempt to break through.
* The 20 week is not a big deal, but the 50 week moving average is a massive resistance line and will be extremely important for the next few weeks.
* While litecoin is still stuck under the 50 week moving average, it might not look bullish because spikes have happened in the past and were rejected. The only difference this week, is the fact that it is going up from the previous week. 

#####The devil is in the details
* Lets take away the moving averages for a moment and see if we can see a pattern/trend line!
* [Do you see it?](https://imgur.com/a/pcEGTG1)
* ...[How about now?](https://imgur.com/a/K7BPvxP)
* This is a weekly resistance line that stretches all the way back to April/June 2019.
* On Nov, 16th 2020, that line was broken and turned into support. 

#####Why this week was so massive
* A quick glance and you can see that litecoin has just had a 2nd green week in a row instead of falling back to the resistance line.
* Normally that isn't significant. But... if we turn off log scale, it makes sense why this week was so massive.
* [Without log scale turned on.](https://imgur.com/a/Av1fLpm)
* Whoa. So that means this week is the first week the resistance was broken.
* Lets turn on the moving averages again and[ see what that tells us.](https://imgur.com/a/tGBE5Ww)
* Now the decline doesn't look that bad, the resistance line has been flipped but not confirmed yet. 
* After confirmation, Litecoin will need to get above the 50 week moving average, this might happen over the next 2-4 weeks. If it does, my opinion is that it will be THE catalyst that brings EVERYONE in on the ratio trade, which will rocket the USD value into the solar system.

#####Conclusion
* Major long term resistance has been broken. The ratio appears to be in the beginning phase of going parabolic. 
* This can still turn upside down. I want to see this week finish strong but more importantly is what happens over the next few weeks.
* If Litecoin can swing low once again (i know it sucks to see, but it is a good thing) and confirm the new support. [Ideally something like this is what I am looking for.](https://imgur.com/a/398Bc4Y). A Break through resistance, swing low to confirm new support, then continue upward and repeat at the 50 week moving average (break, swing low, continue up). That's ideal, but not probable, crypto always surprises.
* IF it happens, it may completely ignore resistance and typical support discovery patterns. You can look at history to see how this could be possible.
* [One last picture](https://imgur.com/a/huISRQN) to demonstrate why this week was so important. A Major support line established way back in March 2017 was touched last week. If Litecoin continued down, it would have broken this support line. But it didn't! It hit the line and bounced really hard. 
* History is not a good indicator, but it sure does rhyme sometimes. The next few weeks will be extremely crucial for medium to long term time frames.

iloveuranus,"Hey guys... I did it. I did the unspeakable thing and SODLd. Just did a quick research; my inbox has a welcome email dated 13th of March 2013, received from the mother of all crypto train wrecks, a place called MtGox. Anyways, I like to think I've got a pretty good track record since then. Not the lambo kind, but I managed to shave a few life-improving profits off Bitcoin, OMG and others. And of course, in May 2017 I discovered my favorite - Ethereum.

The ETH I sold today I bought in summer 2017 and haven't let go of a single gwei since. It has been a wild ride. The 2018 roller coaster of lambos and gentlemen was fun. The years of depression that followed, when this sub (I mean the other sub) was like a warming campfire with a few desperate outcasts huddled around it, were something else. But I held on. Actually, in March 2019, I had a hunch and decided to double my stack. Naturally I haven't regretted my decision - the last months were awesome!

But now I am taking my profits. It got to a point where I couldn't honestly say ""I don't care if it's gone"" anymore. Also, if ETH goes to 10K now, I'll definitely have daydreams of what could have been, but I won't have regrets. Today, I withdrew 1220% of what I put in four years ago, and I will never be sad about that.

I still believe in ETH. I think it's awesome, and there's loads of catalysts ahead. But things can't only go up. I feel there will be a major correction sooner or later. Not 10%. I mean major. On the other hand I've been saying that about the stock market for years and it hasn't happened yet. So no advice here. One thing is for sure though - you'll find me here when there's blood on the streets, fiat in hand, ready to buy :)",guhjtwy,2021-04-14 22:51:45,16
VechainEthnography,"I'm writing an ethnographic diary about Vechain, in the case I'll make a master's thesis about the journey we're currently on!

I want to share the diary entry I made for the 24th of Febuary, when VET was worth 0.045 USD.

&gt;Yikes what a crash we've had the last few days. We went down to 0.035. I think it was triggered by Bitcoin going below 50k USD, and that the entire market followed it down in a crash.

&gt;I really became despondent. I never checked the value of my VET-tokens when the value was at it's lowest, it felt like I was back in 2019 and it's seemingly eternal slowness and bitterness. I really became despondent.

&gt;What's most interesting is how I felt it in my body how I was worried that this would be the start of a 2018-2020 bear-season again. I could really identity the worry and economic plans I had to make for the future, how I would have to start to look for a summer job instead of taking a vacation.

Today is a big day for crypto as a whole. It is now a trillion+ dollar asset class. And Coinbase is going to launch publicly today being valued at $100 billion. It will be one of the few companies going public that will launch already being profitable. And it will join the world of finance being a relatively big juggernaut. I feel today will mark another big turning point in crypto history. Coinbase going public will further entrench crypto into the world of finance. 

It's amazing how much has changed in ~10 years. To think that Bitcoin would turn from a niche community to a trillion dollar asset is mind boggling. It's honestly shocking to think this much time has passed.

Yodel_And_Hodl_Mode,"I've been thinking a lot lately about how the amount hodlers own seems to drop in each cycle - and I'm not talking about newcomers.  I'm talking about long term hodlers.

I posted this in a comment yesterday, but it's worth repeating:

In 2011 (a year before the halving), owning a thousand Bitcoin probably wasn't a big deal. How many 1,000 BTC hodlers from 2011 still had that much in 2013 (a after before the halving)? How many still did the next year?

In 2015 (a year before the halving), owning a hundred Bitcoin probably wasn't a big deal. How many 100 BTC hodlers from 2015 still had that much in 2017 (a after before the halving)? How many still did the next year?

In 2019 (a year before the halving), owning ten Bitcoin wasn't that big of a deal. How many 10 BTC hodlers from 2019 still have that much today? How many still will next year?

This brings me back to a question from a comment below on this page:

&gt; Who is willing to say that we just saw the top of this market?

NOT ME.

Every single day since last November, we've seen idiots calling the top of this rally.  They are the reason they won't own as much BTC during the next rally.  They are their own worst enemy.  The get scared and they sell.  They brag about taking profit, but in reality they're guaranteeing themselves a massive loss going forward.  When Bitcoin hits 100K, 200K, maybe 500K and beyond, they won't be here to celebrate.  Actually, I bet some of them will be here as angry trolls.  I also think some of the bears we see now are people who sold too low and are now bitter.

This is a once in a generation opportunity to be part of something big.  In some ways, it might be fair to say it's a once in a lifetime opportunity.  Don't eff it up.

Let's be honest, the reason why the bears and scares calling the top of the rally so early is fear.  Pure fear.

For anybody reading this who's scared to death, here's my advice: Move your coins to a hardware wallet, secure your seed phrase. and walk away for four years.  That'll put you one year after the next halving, which will be the next big bull run.  When you come back, your investment will be worth so much more than the top you're mistakenly calling today, and all of the old bears who sold back in the day will be wishing they were you, still sitting on your hodl as Bitcoin soared to new highs only dreamt of during the previous cycle.

No, we having had a new all time high in the last hour.  It does not mean the rally is over.

NotInsane_Yet,"Yes and no.  

I have no problem investing in oil sands companies.  Our society needs oil to function and if we are not extracting it here we are going to buy more from far worse places like Saudi Arabia.  I also think people overestimate the environmental difference between oil sands and oil extraction in other countries.  We have a lot of environmental and safety regulations that many other countries don't.  

Natural gas is also required and is one of the best ways to reduce our emissions.  Green energy is nowhere near where it needs to be.  We need a solid stable baseline power generation and in most places that means natural gas will be the least carbon intensive option.  Replacing coal plants with natural gas would be a major reduction.  We also require it to heat our homes.  Electric heat is not a realistic option due to how expensive it is and our grid is not built with it in mind.  If we all switched from gas to electric we would have to build more power plants.  

Bitcoin is a 100% waste of resources though. It takes a massive amount of electricity and provides nothing of value.  I have been divesting my portfolio of most Bitcoin companies.  It's hard though due to how profitable they have been the past year.   

I tend to focus less on the environmental aspect of companies and focus more on the human aspect.  I would never invest in anything from China, Saudi Arabia, etc.  The human rights abuses drive me away.",gujwdys,2021-04-15 09:38:32,21

With its current market valuation of $12.54 Billion, GameStop Corp. 

is set to declare its quarterly results on March 23, 2021. GME 

Stock’s Forward Dividend of 0 and its yield of 0% are making 

investors’ thoughts stronger that it could fall further before the 

company announces its earnings for the current quarter. Analysts 

are in estimates of -$0.68 per share for company’s earnings in the 

current quarter and are expecting its annual EPS growth moving up 

to -$0.98 for 2021 with estimates of that growing to -$0.59 in next 

year. These estimates are suggesting current year growth of -0.54% 

for EPS and -0.4% growth next year.

Analysts watching the company’s growth closely have provided 

estimates for its revenue growth with an average revenue estimate 

of $1.15 Billion. They suggested that in the process company could 

generate revenue of as low as $1Billion which could climb up to 

$1.28 Billion to hit a high. The average estimate is representing 

an increase of 7.3% in sales growth from that of posted by the 

company in the same quarter of last year. In keeping analyst 

consensus estimate with, company is forecasted to be making an 

annual revenue of $5.37 Billion in 2021, which will be +5.5% more 

from revenue generated by the company last year.

In contrast, when we review GME stock’s current outlook then short 

term indicators are assigning it an average of 50% Buy, while 

medium term indicators are categorizing the stock at an average of 

100% Buy. Long term indicators are suggesting an average of 100% 

Buy for it.

According to ratings assigned by 7 analysts at the scale of 1 to 5 

with 1.00 representing a strong buy and 5.00 suggesting a strong 

sell; 2 of them are recommending GameStop Corp. (GME) as a Hold, 

while none are in view that stock is a Buy. Recommendation by None 

analysts for the stock is an Outperform while number of those 

analysts who rated the stock as Underperform is 1, whereas 4 of 

them are considering the stock as a Sell. When taken as whole, 

stock gets a rating of Underweight and that encourages the 

investors to exploit the opportunity and build their stake up in 

the company.

Digging deeper we become aware of the PEG ratio of the GME stock 

which is currently positioned at 0. It further provides that 

stock’s current price level is -13.37% away from its 20-day simple 

moving average and is 10.31% off its SMA50. Its relative strength 

index (RSI) for 14-periods is oscillating at 46.55 while volatility 

remained at 15.71% over the past week which changes to 18.27% when 

measuring it over the past month. Beta is valued at -1.9, while 

measure of average true range or ATR is currently at 34.15. In 

predicting price targets of as low as $3.5 and as high as $175, 

analysts are in agreement on assigning the stock over the next 12 

months average price target of $40.36. Stock’s current price level 

is -97.73% above from estimated low price target while it is 13.58% 

below the estimated high; and even if the GME’s share succeeded to 

reach the median price of $25, then the outlook of -83.77% could 

come to the excitement of the investors.

palebluepixel313,"Answer: The short answer is no one knows why this is happening. There are some factors people can point to:

* Crypto in general has been on a huge upswing lately as more big companies and investment firms buy into it. Bitcoin is up 800% for the year and Etherium 1400%. Large firms may be buying into dogecoin and not disclosing it yet. 
* Elon tweeted about it recently. But he tweets about it all the time and it hasn’t spike liked this every time. 
* Dogecoin has risen enough that it’s gotten mainstream media attention. The subreddit r/dogecoin has lots of pictures of doge being talked about alongside established coins like bitcoin and etherium. Retail investors (people who are not part of a major firm, just have a little money and invest through a brokerage, such as people who use robinhood) can see that it’s spiking and might think they can get in on the action. That leads to more media attention which means more people see it which means more people but in which... 

We can say for sure is that it’s not the wallstreetbets crowd because they aren’t allowed to talk about crypto on that subreddit. There’s one quarantined thread where they can even mention doge and they only created that thread AFTER this spike started happening. 

Here’s some data point we do know:
* The volume of trades in dogecoin is massively up too. That means it’s a LOT of coin being moved around. Which in turn means it’s probably not just a few people trading at a high price while everyone else hodls. But this could in theory be a few large holders trading back and forth at higher prices (at a loss) to try to ladder up the price before they dump all their holdings. 
* There is a single dogecoin holder who owns 25% of all dogecoin. You can see that here, all transactions on a blockchain are public so you can see who owns what (though it’s all anonymous wallet addresses): https://clankapp.com/dogecoin (click Richlist). People suspect this is Robinhood storing all the doge their users have bought in one single giant wallet. If that’s true (robinhood hasn’t confirmed this, but the community is almost positive it’s true) then robinhood traders make up about a quarter of what’s going on here. So it’s bigger than just robinhood users, though they certainly are a substantial part. 
* There are a number of large dogecoin holders who are holding and moving hundreds of millions of dollars in dogecoin. That suggests large institutional investors to me - but I don’t have any hard evidence to back that up.",guqpewr,2021-04-17 01:35:15,24

tigerslices,"i'd start with supply/demand as the number 1 baseline rule of all economics.  


and how digital items for the longest time had a supply issue.  if you could make infinite copies of MP3s and AVIs and MOVs why would anyone EVER pay for a digital game, digital music, digital movies, etc...  


how only in-game purchases of character costume skins made sense as those couldn't be duplicated and shared.  so, restricted supply to match consumer demand.  


and then explaining that netflix blocking certain screen-capture technologies while also being cheap and easier to navigate than torrest and free-stream sites meant meant that they could continue to restrict supply while serving demand.  


that all of this restricted digital access means an ""always connected"" centralized digital network.  you don't Own this stuff you're simply renting access to it.  like how a photoshop license went from buying the software outright, to paying a cheaper monthly subscription.  


then i'd explain that bitcoin is a program that simply attempts to solve equations.  and that there are a finite amount of equations.  solving complex equations is called mining, and once you've solved the equation, THAT equation is assigned a hash that reflects it's code.  each hash, when checked can be verified by any computer running the bitcoin algorithm to double check the math.  


the finite amount of equations is where our fascination with the technology grows, because if this is like saying, ""catch all the pokemon, even the ugly and lame ones... there will never be any other pokemon... ever.""  the scarcity lowers supply.  and so any demand for it will be bottlenecked by the supply.  part of this is appealing, driving demand more.  and the reason for the rise in value is because on a long enough timeline - there will one day no longer be new bitcoin.  


then explain that doge was created as a joke - a much more simple algorithm.  enough to solve the equation but not any type of equation that actually has limits.  it's an infinite number of equations.  so ... on a long enough timeline, we'll have an infinite amount of doge mined... so unless demand stays at infinite levels, the value WILL collapse.",gur39ap,2021-04-17 03:15:30,31
cascading_disruption," The first  time at a conference I got  a question about DOGE, I'll never forget, I  was on a panel with Dan  Larimer and David Johnston and it was being  moderated by Jason King and  it was a mastercoin versus bitshares versus  ethereum panel and at that  time I was still part of the ethereum  project. That was January of  2014. Very long time ago and there was a  joking comment about DOGE  getting smart contracts before us and  conquering the entire world.

**DOGE   has always been for our industry kind of a an inside joke, a pet rock,  a  fun mocking cryptocurrency light-hearted thing and it just always  seems  to be around but it something we, for the most part, have never  taken  seriously recently due to the efforts of Elon Musk principally  and  market manipulation by clever whales DOGE has become stratospheric  and  has become a haven for new entrants into the cryptocurrency space.  Let's  be very clear this is a bubble!** ***The   price of DOGE is not sustainable, it's going to collapse and a massive   amount of retail money is going to be lost very quickly. My belief is   that after that bubble bursts, it will be a catalyst for regulators and   lawmakers to get involved in our industry and hurt the entire  industry.***

It's not a good event and by no means is this sustainable. **You   know when you look at the third generation of cryptocurrencies the   ALGORANDs, the TEZOS, the AVALANCHEs, the CARDANOs, the ETH2... Each of   these projects have large teams, capital and accountability. People  wake  up every single day to try to get the software the protocols and  the  ecosystems to the next level.** They have the aspirations or   reality of use and utility. People use these systems to do interesting   things or promote new business models that we've never seen before.

**DOGE   does not have a stable development team, there is no original   technology in DOGE, it's a copy of bitcoin. If at two o'clock in the   morning a major flaw is discovered there will be no one who's up late at   night trying to find a way to fix it. Maybe a volunteer but no   guarantee. It is a pet rock, it's not real and if this is the gateway   for retail investors to enter our ecosystem at massive losses, at some   point it's going to hurt each and every one of us.** ***After   the bubble burst, because it will, there's going to be congressional   inquiries, there's going to be senate hearings, there's going to be SEC   running around, there's going to be all kinds of regulators running   around saying this is proof that crypto can't control itself.***

We   need to come in and save you and you're not going to like the outcome   and the people leading the third generation were the ones who are going   to have to clean up the mess and endure the consequences of the coming   regulation as a result of the bubble bursting. **It's   a mockery of my life's work, it's a mockery of the hard work and  effort  that so many people put into this industry. In space there is an   enormous difference between the TEZOS and the ALOGORANDs and the   AVALANCHEs and the CARDANOs and DOGE.**

The   science alone, the papers alone, the code alone, there's nothing  that's  a copy. It's all novel and original and people put so much  effort and  work into it and to have this surge be what defines our  industry and the  perception of our industry where does that lead? ***So,   I know a lot of people are celebrating on that side of the aisle and   they think this is just the best thing ever and Elon Musk continues to   post and post and post and really seems to enjoy doing this but what   goes up will come down and our industry is going to be worse for it.***

**So,   my warning to anybody who will listen is don't buy DOGE! Get out of   DOGE! If you've made money, great, get the hell out of it! It's a   bubble, it's not real, there's nothing sustainable there and to the   industry as a whole stand up to this behavior, this manipulation, we   have grown beyond this. If we continue doing these things we will be   regulated to a point where we no longer have freedom in autonomy and   we're no better than the banks!**

You'll   have to get a crypto charter just like you get a bank charter. It'll  be  an invitation only club and controlled by the top down and any  freedom  that we have managed to pull back from the legacy financial  system will  be lost because of our stupidity and avarice. It has to  stop and it's  getting too big!

**45   billion, 50 billion, what happens when it gets to 100 billion? To 200   billion? These numbers bring lawmakers in, these numbers bring   international regulation in, it has to stop and it's not!**

**No   one seems to be calling it out and saying hey let's slow this down,  hey  industry be careful, there's no substance behind what's happening  here,  it is what it is. I guess the caravan moves on** and the work continues and **I'll   be here tomorrow and the day after and the day after and the day after   even if there are hard days even if we get yelled at, even if we have  to  somehow deal with new regulations even, if we have to deal with bad   perceptions of the industry going into yet another crypto winter.**

**We   endured a few before, we'll endure another again. I'm just sad and   sorry for all people that are going to lose money and I'm sad and sorry   for all the people in our industry that are delighting from this event   knowing full well what it's going to do.** Until next time, talk to you guys later...",gur83ri,2021-04-17 03:51:41,58

yomjoseki,"Market cap is simply the market price of a given currency multiplied by it's circulating supply.

Let's say there's one million theory coins in supply and they're each selling for $1,000. That's a market cap of $1 billion.

Now, apply the same to Bitcoin. There's 18,684,468 BTC in supply and they're going for $62,232 on the market at time of this post. That's how we get the current market cap for Bitcoin, which is $1.16 trillion.

Except, $1.16 trillion hasn't been spent on Bitcoin. First of all, every single one of those Bitcoins has been mined. They were created by processing power and electricity.

Now, of all the Bitcoins in existence, some never changed hands from the time they were mined. Some were bought a long time ago (when the market price was much, much cheaper) and have been held ever since.

 As a currency, Bitcoin is currently still immature - transactions are expensive. It's environmentally wasteful. Most of all, the value is insanely volatile.

&gt;Ethereum has actual utility: the network is basically a huge decentralized computer snd you pay in Eth for clock cycles when you interact with applications in it.

We're in a bull run right now, and almost everything is trending upwards. People get over confident and start investing much more than they're willing to lose. If we keep going up and people are able to take out their investments and some more, then great. But sometimes that doesn't happen.

JayCeye,"Read this if you’re scared about the “unlimited supply” of Doge. Doge is in the best position to be the peer 2 peer and business payment system for the world.  Doge is fundamentally the same as Bitcoin and litecoin, with fast transfer speeds and very little fees compared to other cryptos and is already being used in so many businesses. Theres an annual cap of 5b mineable coins. If you think of crypto being used for world transactions - that’s over tens of trillions of dollars a day - billions of coins is not enough to handle that load. For a crypto to handle that much transactions, you would need over a trillion coins and based on Doge’s 5 billion supply cap per year, it would take 174 years for Doge to get to that amount. So Doge’s “unlimited supply” will never affect anyone and the claim that the supply amount hurts the value of the coin is FALSE. Dont believe these people who cry that it has unlimited supply and you’re buying a coin with no value.

TheDireNinja,"I have a few questions about VeChain and maybe about crypto in general. I’m fairly new here but I’ve been doing some research, although there are a few questions I have. 

In the case of Bitcoin, from what I understand, the blockchain was designed for the purpose of the cryptocurrency itself. However in the case of the VeChain Thor blockchain, it was designed as a service for logistics in supply chains. If that is the case what is the purpose of VET and VTHO. I understand that VTHO is used to fuel the blockchain from the perspective of people who actually want to use the blockchain. Like BMW for its supply chain logistics. So what is the purpose of VET. I guess I don’t understand that if VeChain Thor is for services and not strictly for Crypto. Why does it have its own duel coin system if businesses could pay FIAT currency for the services just like any other service that isn’t blockchain based?

Also. Etherium. VeChainThor. These all have coins with within their own ecosystems. Like VET VTHO OCE SHA etc. 

So what is the term of the ‘parent’ that gives life to all of these coins. Is it blockchain? Protocol? Platform? Architecture? Etc. 

Does Bitcoin have any other coins within its ecosystem?

With DLT, who exactly is doing the computations that’s fueling the blockchain? In the case of VeChain, who is it then? Is it the node holders, or the people ‘mining’? If not the node holders then what’s the purpose of holding nodes, if not to just gain rewards?

100acrewood,"Well, I did it. I sold all of my BTC for ETH except a very small amount. It is bittersweet because Bitcoin started my crypto adventure in 2013 and I don't think I've had a rush like I did when I read the whitepaper and grasped the potential of it. It also lead me to ETH which changed my life. After the 2017 debacle with block sizes and stagnating BTC, moving to a ""store of value"" instead of currency, I lost a lot of faith in BTC. But it still had a special place in my heart.

Now that ETH has matured into the defi industry it is today I decided it is time to move on. The final icing on the cake was seeing the whole 40% hashrate drop when China shut down some of its power. That is horrifying to me for any one country to have that amount of hashrate. Also at first the whole ""BTC uses too much power and hurts the environment"" was a red herring to me but after more reflection I've come to realize that I agree that it isn't necessary when we have Proof of Stake available. So I had to confront my own cognitive dissonance of ""ETH is the one true coin"" and ""better hold BTC just in case"". Not that I'm a maxi by any means, but my personal ideology aligns with Ethereum and BTC doesn't have a place for me anymore.

The upcoming releases and scaling in ETH is probably the most excited I've been about the space since that first day I read the BTC whitepaper. It is really happening, and whether the irrational market aligns the price this cycle or not, I will wait as long as I have to in order to see ETH become the financial backbone of humanity.

This also means I may moan about the ratio in days to come. Sorry in advance.

Don't be. Cryptocurrencies are volatile. Bitcoin less so than others, but still very volatile overall. But nothing whatsoever has changed that would make it less of a great investment.

The question should not be ""will Bitcoin do nothing but go up"", because the answer is no. The answer is no to any investment you can possibly think of, even bonds when you factor in inflation.

The question should be ""is Bitcoin likely to have a better ROI than other things I can invest in""? If you thought the answer was yes the day you bought, if you bought for the right reasons, then the answer should still be yes. I certainly know I believe it'll perform better than other things would in the short, medium, and long term. Sure, some things have a decent shot at having a better return in the short term, but those things also have a good chance of freefalling. People aren't going to stop buying dips.

JayCeye,"Read this if you need to know why Doge is the most talked about investment in the ENTIRE world right now and why Elon Musk supports Doge and why Mark Cuban said he will never sell ANY Dogecoins. Doge is in the best position to be the peer 2 peer and business payment system for the world.  Doge is fundamentally the same as Bitcoin and litecoin, with fast transfer speeds and very little fees compared to other cryptos and is already being used in many businesses. Theres an annual supply cap of 5b mineable coins. If you think of crypto being used for world transactions - that’s over tens of trillions of dollars a day - billions of coins is not enough to handle that load. For a crypto to handle that much transactions, you would need over a trillion coins and based on Dogecoins 192b supply and 5 billion supply cap per year, it would take 174 years for Doge to get to that amount. Doge supply can’t increase fast enough to even get anywhere NEAR being over supplied. We’re talking nearly 900 years for Doge to be at a supply that equals what the US gets in taxes alone for only 1year!!! So Doge’s “unlimited supply” claim will never affect anyone and the claim that the supply amount hurts the value of the coin is FALSE. Dont believe these people who spread lies and say you’re buying a coin with no value. They’re just trying to push the price down so they can buy lower.",gv83zg8,2021-04-21 02:28:58,30

AmericanScream,"&gt;Many discussions of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency—I am going to use “Bitcoin” and “cryptocurrency” interchangeably for convenience, even though Bitcoin is just a specific cryptocurrency—begin with a long explanation of the blockchain technology that makes it possible. I think for the purposes of talking about what Bitcoin means and does, this is a mistake and a distraction—**like having a discussion about the social effects of air travel by talking about how ailerons work.**

A good analogy of a popular butter tactic.   Rather than present to you how their pig with hot-glued wings can fly, they want to explain to you the unique amazing hot glue technology that's part of their flying pig industry.   Wait, you want to know how fast our pigs can fly?   In a second, but first, let's talk more about gluechain, the de-fi technology that is behind flying pigs!

DarkDrai,"Doge's increase in the supply of coins effectively slows over time, because the number of coins added is fixed, therefore adding a slightly lower percentage to the total number of coins each time more coins are added. This creates a soft cap on the supply of Doge, as opposed to the hard cap on Bitcoin, etc.

This is just my own personal speculation, but I think maybe hard-capped cryptos are easier for large financial institutions to monopolize because it's easier for them to buy more of the crypto early, and then abuse their larger supply to manipulate the price of it later. Doge, on the other hand, does not have this same drawback, and can always be mined for more coins. It is the coin of the people.

Again, this is my dumb, uneducated theory of how this works. I could be completely wrong about all of it. Hopefully someone else can provide better answers. :P",gv994gs,2021-04-21 07:14:26,28

* BNB makes a strong recover setting at over 580.
* BCH recovers more strongly than LTC and pushes LTC down to rank 10.
* VET stays pretty stable amidst the many screams of how strong it pumps.
* XMR makes some serious moves and sits nicely over 400. A new local high of 418.95 is set.
* ATOM jumps back over 20. Fans are cautiously optimistic.
* MANA sees extra hype as it is making some gains.
* CELO is clearly the biggest top 100 gainer with 45% gains.

TripplBubbl,"As Bitcoin's biggest threat, the path to glory is going to be more difficult for nano than any other coin. That much became clear when prominent bitcoin maxis with hundreds of thousands of followers posted news about Nano's spam attack and degraded network. But of course, those same people have been strangely quiet about V22 or any positive discourse about Nano's fundamentals...

We are at a point where pretty much all of the influential voices in the cryptocurrency space have a vested interest in Bitcoin. And it's more than just their wallet; most of these people have built their entire brand around Bitcoin. Pomp for example. He cannot just come out tomorrow and say '""I've decided to invest in Nano as it is the superior technology"" because the entire brand he has built over the past few years will collapse. The only thing he can do to keep his status, relevance and wealth is to suppress anything that threatens Bitcoin's throne. 

This is why our journey to the top is not just a struggle, but a fight. It's going to be a long and rocky road, but little by little, just as we're seeing now with the community getting ever so slightly larger and the price getting ever so slightly bigger, we will chip away at the haters and break through to real people.

StickyRedPostit,"1) Everyone who uses it agrees it has a value in ""real money"". This is the same of every currency - a dollar has value because we all agree that it does. Imagine you want to buy a chicken, but all you have is wool from the sheep you own. The person selling chickens doesn't want wool, but he does want his axe sharpened. The axe sharpener will accept wool for sharpening the chicken person's axe. 

Money just shortcuts the whole barter process, and because everyone agrees that $1 has a set value, we can buy and sell things without a huge chain of bartering.

Bitcoin (and other cryptos) have value because enough people say they do, but unlike other currency, there isn't a government-supported central bank messing with the value of it, allowing us to separate our money from governments.

2) Every transaction on a blockchain is recorded by every other user on the blockchain. Imagine you and your friends go to a bar, and buy each other rounds of drinks. If one friend records who bought what, they have the potential to lie in their record. But, if everyone records everything everyone else buys, then we can compare all the records and ensure they're all correct. Bitcoins are added to this global network of ""ledgers"" when they're created, and every time a transaction is made, all the other ledgers are updated to record this transaction - and if there's a discrepancy, the version of the ledger that's the greatest volume of all of them is the correct one and everyone gets updated.

3) You can't prove you're the owner of the wallet without the ""keys"" that come with it. The wallet contains a private encryption key used to access and edit the blockchain, and that can't be replicated. It's like losing your debit card, except there's no bank to verify that you own the wallet.

4) Yes, someone else is offering to buy a bitcoin for another currency - they give you money, you give them a bitcoin, and it moves to their wallet.

5) It's designed to be very complex so that nobody can cheat it, and one of the problems blockchain is going to face is the obscene energy requirements to keep it running properly - the whole system only works if it's fairly inefficient, and part of that inefficiency is complexity.",gvg7r6n,2021-04-22 23:52:32,146

MyOtherAcctsAPorsche,"Several misconceptions.

bitcoin is not a company. It's the name we astronomers gave to our ""star trading system"". there is no single astronomer behind it, and in the case of bitcoin, even the first astronomer that came up with the idea ""vanished"" (even if they came back now, they have no special privilege, besides whatever coins they might have, like anyone else, they don't have any sort of ""admin password"").

Crypto companies, are companies, websites, etc that mainly deal with crypto stuff. The same way Amazon was a books company. They don't need to be miners or have computational power at all.

Miners are the ones with the computational power. They spend it on looking for a solution to an equation, the same way astronomers use their telescopes to find stars.

Computational power from miners is not being sold, it's being spent. The way a power plant spends coal to make electricity. They don't sell coal, and no one is buying computational power. What you do buy is the end product, the security of the bitcoin system or the electricity the power plant produces.

If I misunderstood, and you where asking ""Are miners turning their computational power into money?"" then the answer is yes! But not by selling it as you would rent a supercomputer to calculate medical stuff to cure cancer, find UFOs or predict the weather. They are turning it into money by getting rewarded for keeping the bitcoin network secure.",gvgiirb,2021-04-23 01:08:17,38

_Pohaku_,"Dumb take. Value of your assets is only measurable in goods and services. Measuring one currency against another currency when neither is locked to the price of goods and services is dumb and pointless.

So stop thinking about how many bitcoins you have, and stop thinking about how many dollars you could swap them for, because both are arbitrary meaningless numbers.

Think about how many loaves of bread you could swap your currency for. If your bitcoins buy you more loaves than they did yesterday, you got richer. If they buy less loaves of bread than they did yesterday, you got poorer.

Fact of the matter is, whether you like it or not, dollars are more stable when compared to bread than bitcoin is. If the dollar value of your bitcoin goes down, then so does the number of loaves you can buy with it.

In other words, all us hodlers have gotten poorer over the last week. To deny it and say ‘1BTC = 1BTC’ is to demonstrate that you don’t understand currency.

We continue to hodl not because we love having possession of cryptographic keys that give us ownership of UTXOs that we are fond of, but because we believe that in the long run, either our coins will buy more bread than they do now, OR because we believe in the other benefits of decentralised currency and are willing to become poorer in return for those benefits.",gvjoiuk,2021-04-23 17:47:51,37
MisterHonkeySkateets,"Also, good ol’ moat-building. Many existing tradespeople were grandfathered in (the term ‘grandfathered’ owes its etymology to voting rights, where a voter’s right to cast a ballot was tied to whether or not their grandfather had been able to vote, which disenfranchised poor non-blacks, but of course was a Jim Crow tool for disenfranchisement of blacks, which brings me back around to my favorite modern truth: that *the struggle* is truly along class lines and the disparate sets of historical suffrage groups, regardless of race, orientation, religion or gender, have more in common, and would do better to, UNITE against the masters, as of now we’re still being played via the oldest move in the play-book: divide and conquer).

Whereby, if a person already cut hair or even already sold insurance, for example, for a certain span of time, they were exempt from any further vetting requirements such as pre-requisite certifications or continuing education classes thrust upon anyone new trying to enter the space. -Always billed as quality control in pursuit of protecting ethical standards and health and safety and never as just plain old moat building and classism. This is not to suggest that racism was not also part and parcel to the scheme - - it was likely seen as a feature and not a bug - - but that instead, self interest and war against the lower class (in a two-class system nested in the US) was the primary goal. 

After all, black cosmetologists did not (and largely still do not) compete for customers with non-blacks; the cultural touch stone that is encompassed by black hair is such that black beauticians were never going to take a customer from, say, a white barber, but rather they might still enrich themselves from within their own communities. 

Famously (but perhaps not actually) the first US black woman millionaire, Madam C.J. Walker, Née Breedlove, made her fortune in the black hair care and beauty products space, including skin-bleaching kits - - added here to touch on how truly body dysmorphic our culture was/is - - capitalizing on a market heretofore occupied by white owned corporations.

All that to remind you that we’re all just patsies for the ruling class. One moment it’s blacks taking advantage of government assistance, the next it’s white nationalists taking the bait and blaming the scapegoat instead of the beneficiary of the system, both groups historically and presently disenfranchised, all just feed stock for the vampires - - figuratively, i hope - - of our debt and fiat currency system.

In the early, early days we used to talk about whales. Individuals who could push the market with a literal million USD. Those days are loooong gone. We all wanted adoption. The issue was no one could define what that meant. We had 6-7 years of trying to decide if BTC was a currency. We now know it most certainly is not. We now know it is a store of value. The entire narrative of BTC being able to replace or at least disrupt the legacy financial system was the goal. The legacy financial system now owns Bitcoin. The party is over. Organic growth and adoption is impossible. The price of bitcoin has been controlled via the futures market since its inception in 2017. They said they'd do it, they did it and it is only getting more controlled as time goes on. Now that larger banks and investment firms have sunk their teeth into the asset, it is certain that they control and manipulate the price of BTC as they do the stock market. 

My hope is that people truly start to understand this now and maybe for the first time in history, retail will be able to drop something on the heads of wall street. Bitcoin only has value because regular folks brought it there. We wanted it because we wanted to fight the financial system with another financial system. Now that banks own it. Regular folks can unload on the banks and turn interest to something else. The truth is, the banks bought themselves out of obsolescence and it is due to the fact that we asked them to do it so we could get rich. In the same way that gold and silver prices are artificially manufactured, so is BTC and with the control the price and media (like the reg stock market) you control sentiment. Bitcoin once was an alternative. Now it is an alternative controlled by those we were trying to escape from. So it is no longer an alternative. Bitcoin is now a collectible with 21 million units.

[PNF Chart and Truck Picture](https://imgur.com/a/jcnt0Pk)

The price is obviously in a long column of Os.  We hit a low pole warning last night.  This formation is called a “Bearish Triangle Breakdown.”  It is not a common formation and it is not exactly “bullish” as the name denotes.

That said, the low pole warning should resolve with an eventual move back up the column at least 50%.  This would be an 8 box move from the bottom.  Wherever that is…

The lowest box right now is down at 47,955.

Local support, coming up from the January lows, is currently at 44,284.  I don’t expect a drop that that point today, but its there.  And there isn’t much between where we are now, and that point.  So, include this possibility in your plans.

It appears were are right back to where we were before /Elon started his bullshit.  I hope he keeps focused on Dogecoin, and leaves Bitcoin alone.  Keep in mind, that in the grand scheme of things the price fell back about 3 months.  That isn’t exactly the end of the world—or the bull market.

I watch the TV now and laugh at the commentators telling the stupid people how “Bitcoin is dead” again.  90% of these people have no idea what crypto is or how it works.   Even the newest of crypto buyers have a better sense of this than the broadcasters.

Keep in mind that during this “trend cycle” we are still up 196%—and the trend line is at $22,000.  We are far from ending this cycle.

Shnatsel,"I'll speak from some experience with distributed systems, mostly DHT-based, and then following the blockchain in its early days. My perspective might be a bit dated.

Blockchain is all about removing trust in a central party. So if whatever central party you're currently relying on for money/bookkeeping/etc is doing its job well, you probably don't need it. It's relegated to uses where such institutions are dysfunctional (e.g. governmental money is hyperinflating) or it's impossible to have a trusted central party (anyone acting as one will be promptly banned by the Great Firewall).

In my city you can actually go and buy a burger for bitcoin, but the transaction fee will cost more than the burger, and the payment will take longer to come through than it takes to cook the burger. Using literally any other payment option is better. 

But Bitcoin sort of works for evading mass surveillance in a country that monitors all financial transactions, e.g. to buy a VPN, which is an important use case. You don't particularly care about fees or latency in this scenario.

Twister (the p2p Twitter alternative) uses a blockchain for user registrations, with the rest of the system being DHT-based. That's how it manages to consistently work in China despite numerous attempts to ban it. That's one of the very few actually useful application of blockchain that I'm aware of.

Namecoin is a great idea that could solve very real issues with DNS and certificate authorities, dramatically improving the security of HTTPS, but it's held back by the lack of support for subdomains and thin clients.

On the other hand, I have never seen an ""enterprise blockchain"" project with a reasonable value proposition, and the very premise sounds incongruous.

Personally I tend to avoid blockchain-related projects. I believe there's quite enough people working on that stuff already, and I'm better off investing my time in something that's currently understaffed.",gvkscn5,2021-04-24 00:37:27,36

Lots of people looking at the 21 week MA (near $44k), but it's possible that level gets front-run. Worst case, I think Bitcoin tests the 9 month EMA. But so far this drop looks pretty healthy.

The ones that look the worst ([LTC](https://www.tradingview.com/x/iZrvodZ6/) and [XLM](https://www.tradingview.com/x/p1qANZBy/) as examples) are merely back-testing important support levels and near their own 100 day MA's.

Nagosh,"Bold prediction time: never under 47k again.

This thread is easily the most bearish this sub has been in months, possibly years. Probably the covid crash would top this but that's about it. Almost 1 in every 3 posts I read is wondering if this bull run is over. And while I think a healthy dose of skepticism is warranted, I  think the current amount of bearishness isn't.

For one, it is completely normal for bitcoin to range for a long while. It took 3 months for bitcoin to break through 3k in 2017. It's only been 2 months from when we first broke 50k. We could still be in this range for another month before breaking out.

And even if that was the top, this should imply that the bear market would be equally as tame. I doubt we would ever go below 30k.

But some evidence to point toward our recent low of 47k being the bottom. Yesterday was one of the highest long liquidation events this year. You could argue that it doesn't indicate *the* bottom. Like in late Feb, it took 6 days after a big liquidation before finding a bottom. However, 5 days ago we did have that insane 4B+ liquidation event. IMO, that combined with today's purge has flushed out all high leveraged positions. 

Spot has also had a huge increase in volume. Yesterday had the 8th largest volume YTD on coinbase, and 5 days ago was the 6th. This shows there is massive bid support; combined with the info that bitcoin is still leaving exchange addresses implies that this bitcoin is being bought and removed from circulation. 

Funding is low or even negative on some exchanges. This will also help buoy the price, preventing another leg down. And OI has continued to decline throughout this push down. 

tl;dr - this move down was caused by panic selling and long liquidations. Spot markets have stepped up to the plate and bought the panic sellers. I don't think we make another low. We could consolidate for another month before making a new ATH, but I also wouldn't be surprised if we make a new ATH within 10 days.",gvn5g3j,2021-04-24 12:07:01,30

wanderingdatageeks,"**Analysis:**

Over $55mil in long liquidations over the last 4 hours. Most likely causing the dip down to $48k. Not as much as we've seen yesterday, but still a fairly significant amount of liquidations.

Funding Rates for longs still look high across exchanges on bybt, so I wouldn't be surprised if we saw some more liquidations if we get some sideways action or don't make a move up. But, on glassnode aggregated perpetual funding rates were actually negative. 

Exchange Balance actually ticked up yesterday. I'm seeing roughly 3k more bitcoin on exchanges which is signaling more downside.

Hash Rate and Mining Difficulty look unchanged from yesterday. 

On the bullish side of things, 2.37B USDT was deposited across the exchanges yesterday, second only to the Tesla announcement day... take that as you will. 

The daily looks very similar to the Feb 27/28th. Yesterday's doji star on the daily signals a reversal is in play (27th) and now seeing one last flush before a strong move to the upside (28th -2%)

I think we'll see some downside movement today as we continue to flush through overleveraged longs. But, couple days I just see a big breakout to upside

&amp;#x200B;

**My Soapbox:**

Price drops are really strongly correlated to longs getting liquidated, which happens en masse on the exchanges. 

Millions of Dollars worth of BTC will suddenly flood order books within minutes which forces the price down. As soon as liquidations subside price moves up. The biggest detriment to this market is liquidations on margin.",gvoexcs,2021-04-24 20:38:09,39

-0-O-,"&gt;This is NOT discussed enough about the actual blockchain technology behind cardano.

Oh boy, here we go.

&gt;We all know Eth is a gen 2 that can't scale.

No, we don't all know that. Nobody knows whether or not that is the case, and Eth2 is moving towards the same features that are native in Cardano. 

&gt;Hence BSC binance has swooped in and basically copied their network and made some changes but it is Centralized. The whale wallets make up 88% of all BSC.

&gt;It's nothing revolutionary and basically is a centralized blockchain that is copying all ETH projects to provide lower fees.

Totally agree here. BSC is a copy of ETH, with more centralization. 

&gt;As for Cardano what is not talked about enough and simply not understood by 95% of crypto investors is that Cardano has a layered architecture! The CLS and CCL. Cardano Settlement Layer and Cardano Computational Layer. These 2x layers are Unique to Cardano which allows a full framework which is unlike the blockchains of Ethereum and BSC which use a single layer.

Ethereum also has two layers. Here's an [old article](https://cia.news/en/ethereum-founder-proposes-to-integrate-ethereum-and-bitcoin-cash/) where Buterin talks about how the current data layer is scalable, but the computational layer is not, and discusses what will be different in ETH2 to scale the computational layer.

&gt;Cardano is fully Decentralized and Has Full governance system built in, so literally govts, fortune 500s, can have full control or it can run as a DAO. It's so versatile and it's fully scaleable. With advent of Hydra we are talking over 1,000,000 tps. But that's another topic for another day.

Cardano governance does not mean that governments and fortune 500s can have full control. It means that the entirety of the network has full control. Any DAO governance is built into smart contracts, and is separate from Cardano governance. You're conflating the two things, unless you're talking about private chains that use Ouroboros, but are not the public ADA chain. In which case, that really has no bearing on ADA. 

&gt;What you and all investors need to understand about blockchain technology is that Cardano is built.from ground up with academic papers and it's built Securely using Haskell. Which is what banks use. So there not hacked. Plutus smart contracts is built with Haskell language.

Building with Haskell does not make something unhackable. It is a more secure language, and it will eliminate *some* of the dapp hacks we've seen on ETH, but a vast majority of exploits have not been due to unexpected code execution, but instead poorly developed dapps to begin with. This will still 100% be possible when coding in Plutus. It's still 100% possible that Cardano itself has exploits. Haskell is not a magic wand.

&gt;The layered architecture Cardano uses is Gen 3.0 blockchain technology. The settlement Layer is where p2p transactions happen. The CCL is where smart.contracts happen and where computations are done. This layered architecture is completely different than Ethereum which has a single layer which causes it to bottleneck and crazy high gas fees.

Already covered, and this isn't entirely correct.

&gt;Cardano architecture is built to allow regulatory compliance! But also can be used for privacy as while. The use of meta data and the 2x layer architecture is game changing. With the advent of Hydra and full scalability, Cardano has the versatility to do whatever is needed.

Misleading at best. These are things included in the roadmap, not things that are built into the core architecture at this time. From the wording on the roadmap, it appears this will be in the form of official smart-contract DAOs that can be tied into other smart contracts to enable compliance. The same thing can be done on any turing-complete smart-contract capable chain, and in fact you don't have to look hard to see other projects discussing this same sort of thing.

&gt;ZKP. Zero knowledge Proofs. Along with other methods can ensure data stays encrypted and private for fortune 500s but at same time Cardano architecture allows it versatility.

Zk is again, already in use on other chains.

&gt;Also it's interoperability with side chains, it's scalability with hydra, and it's dual layered architecture Cardano will make it a next level blockchain that can revolutionize many Industries and governments. The sky is truly the limit.

So, ""also the things that I've already listed, but never went into detail about, or offered a fair comparison to other chains with similar items on their roadmap""

------

Look, I'm bullish on Cardano, but you've written a whole lot of nothing here. You mention all of these things from the roadmap, and from Charles' speeches, but you titled your post ""The Truth Why Cardano Is Next Gen Compared To Others."", and then you fail to meaningfully compare any other blockchains. I would say the only fair comparison is that haskell is a more secure choice over other languages. The rest is misleading at best, and flat out wrong at worst.",gvr8x17,2021-04-25 07:22:03,43

Bearish divergences in RSI which span multiple months. Exchange inflows in USDT and BTC indicate people buying the dip AND possibly posting more collateral to cover trapped long positions. Funding is staying neutral showing traders are hesitant and not quite ready to long this yet, and open interest is dropping sharply (possibly due to the high volume liquidations we've gotten the past few days). Even in Ethereum alone, 1hr red candles show a lot more volume than green candles, meaning people are waiting and selling into the bounce.

Bomba_Claude,"There are so many people in this sub that don't seem to understand how incredibly important Bitcoin's simplicity and its first mover advantage are.

Having an ""old"" or very simple core protocol is actually a good thing. It reduces the attack surface of Bitcoin. The more complex the code is, the bigger the chance someone will find a way to manipulate it.

When building a decentralized system, that one day can replace the entire worldwide banking system, you actually want something simple as its base layer. In this case the most important task of the network is to just continue adding blocks to the blockchain. Just very boring: block after block after block. That is what we need. The database that stores all records, the blockchain, is at the very core of what we need: we need a simple robust database that can not be changed. We don't need any fancy stuff in the base layer.

And Bitcoin's first mover advantage has made it so that it's now the most used and tested crypto of them all. White hat hackers, black hat hackers, regular deverlopers, a lot of eyes have gone over the Bitcoin code to search for weaknesses. This is why first mover advantage makes Bitcoin the most tested blockchain available.

I think that there's many newcomers to this space that overlook how important it is to have a simple, robust, trusted and tested blockchain as the backbone of the network. Yes, things like transactions per second and fees and privacy and speed of transactions also matter. And if you're looking to transfer relatively small amounts of value across the world, then you can definitely use other coins. Especially if you are going to convert those coins again to something else like fiat.

But when you are just looking to store a lot of value in a blockchain, wouldn't you choose the most robust blockchain available? This is the reason why big companies are now converting fiat on their balance sheets to Bitcoin. The Bitcoin blockchain is the most trustworthy blockchain out there to store value because it's a simple system that works and has the best proven track record.

I probably could have worded this all better, but I hope the message comes across especially to the newcomers. Also, Andreas Antonopoulos has some great talks about this subject as well. I would suggest to listen to what he has to say on this topic as well.",gvv47vq,2021-04-26 07:00:39,25

My comment yesterday:

This video was posted earlier of some TA on VET:

Obviously none of this is guaranteed, but he believes VET has been following Elliot Wave Theory over the past year.

Not to say that it will hold and continue into wave 5.

According to his TA, we are now entering wave 4, a downward correction wave (for the next few weeks or so), before it goes into wave 5 which is the final wave up.
He has wave 5 targeted to peak in July/August at around $1.50.

Again, obviously he could be wrong about timelines/prices or the whole thing, it is just his analysis and he can't predict the future he can only analyze what he thinks may happen.
It could do something totally different and not follow that wave pattern in the future.

But the thing that really piqued my interest after digesting the video was looking at the Bitcoin 1 year (and Log) chart.

It looks like Bitcoin is following the same wave pattern over the last year, but with VET gaining major sats on the wave 3 up.

It will be interesting to see if we consolidate and/or drop a bit over the next 2-4 weeks and then take a turn up.

If we do, and he is right, wave 5 might be a wild ride up.

Yeah, it is true that in a society with more financial incentives to get any source of energy possible and turn it towards mining, a higher proportion will be renewable. This is because crypto mining is much better suited to renewables than ""normal"" electricity usage. This exactly the conclusion of the paper linked in the tweet:

&gt; Bitcoin mining could encourage investment in solar systems, enabling renewables to generate a higher percentage of grid power with no change in the cost of electricity

The _proportion_ of electricity generated by renewables will be higher. But the absolute amount of electricity consumed will be much higher! No-one is even denying this, they just fail to mention it when promoting their crypto ETFs! Cryptocurrencies in themselves aren't bad, but proof of work is.

Did I praise something?

&gt; ...faker than most cryptos. Once people stop believing...

...no, that part is true of *all* money. Congratulations, you've stumbled on the core concept of money: The value it has is very nearly entirely related to what it can be exchanged for.

But you're wrong about ""most cryptos"" being somehow ""more real"". In fact, the opposite is true: As you point out, everyone believes fiat money has value -- my landlord doesn't take Bitcoin, the grocery store doesn't take Monero, I can't pay my taxes with Etherium, no one will fill (or charge) my car for Dogecoin. 100% of the things I need money for accept US dollars, 0% of them accept crypto.

I guess *very* briefly I could buy video games with crypto... but [not anymore](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/6/16743220/valve-steam-bitcoin-game-store-payment-method-crypto-volatility).

So, hilariously, the only value these crypto""currencies"" have is the fact that people like you will give me actual money in exchange for them. And I bet that's the very first thing these CI-abusing crypto-miners did: Exchange their ill-gotten crypto for fiat money, so they could go actually buy stuff.

&gt; Not to mention the insane amount of money being printed this past year...

[It's not really more than in previous years](https://www.moneyfactory.gov/resources/productionannual.html). You're probably thinking of all those stimulus checks, but those didn't literally print money, they *borrowed* it. And it didn't have the effect you think it did:

&gt; ...really destroys the value...

Turns out inflation in 2020 really wasn't significantly worse than other recent years. Deficits aren't *good,* exactly, but this one didn't seem to destroy anything. On the contrary, being able to rapidly pump money into the economy in response to a global crisis like the pandemic is kind of a nice feature for a currency to have, even if we might wish that it wasn't such a centralized power structure.

&gt; ...your piece of paper with some numbers on it has.

Wait, you think this is about digital currency vs physical?

I carry cash for emergencies now, but almost all the money I use is digital. It's just handled by banks and credit card companies, who can do it infinitely more efficiently than blockchains, and can also provide things like fraud protection on top of that -- if my credit card gets stolen, I pay zero of the fraudulent transactions and I get a new credit card. If my cash gets stolen, it's only $20 or whatever.

The bitcoin price moved up overnight, reversing into a column of Xs, breaking out, AND creating a high pole warning.

I should remind folks that the high and low poles do not usually happen in consecutive days.  This type of volatility is unusual—even for bitcoin.

Yet, here we are.

The price targets for this break out are between $52,448 (based on width of the formation) and $57,361 based on the last breakout, which was 15 boxes.  These targets are to be expected in the next 10-14 days.  Although with the speed of price action these past few days it might be sooner.

A break down would occur if the price reversed today down to $48,919.  That does no seem likely. 

Our local resistance level is 55,122.  This resistance is coming down from the 4/21 high.

Our local support is $49,408.  This is coming up from 4/23.

The High Pole Reversal target is at $51,414.  That does not necessarily mean an end to this formation—it just means that a pull back after such an energetic move upwards should be expected.

The current trend line point is $22,964.  At this time I write this, we are about $30,700 above this price.  The trend seems to be very intact.",gvxowdy,2021-04-26 23:54:14,30

Master of Coin (tsla CFO) mentioned they sold 10% of position. This means they bought $1.5 billion, then sold 10% when it was worth $2.73 billion or so. Bringing their total cash value at the original cost basis to $1.33 billion (maybe it’s not $1.35 because of fees/slippage/time in and out of market?). I think this explains the reported numbers but I’m not an accountant and public reporting of these assets is complicated. 

This means the current value of their holdings is at least $1.8 billion (probably more tbh) doing some ninja math/guesswork.

The important part is they are committed to using it as a liquid store of value, and keeping customer purchases in Bitcoin as Bitcoin, may accumulate more but are not making any announcements. CFO mentioned that liquidity is super important to them and they were pleased with their experience so far, proving our their original thesis that Bitcoin offers an attractive treasury asset that is still liquid while providing a return for holders.

I think this is pretty cool. Perhaps the 10% sell was the CFO demonstrating that liquidity to the board, and conveniently posting a profit to offset the missed targets this quarter due to “supply chain issues”. My personal view is Elon challenged the CFO on these points, and is trying to “shake the tree” to see if there’s flaws in the thesis. Elon is being potentially adversarial (“maybe Doge and speculation can rock Bitcoin too much”) if only to check it out. This is my blindly hopium interpretation. If Bitcoin continues to prove itself, I expect Tesla to increase their sizing and perhaps integrate it more tightly with their “distributed utility scale” energy generation business, which Elon was super passionate about on the call...

I think “ok, I bought 100 btc for 30 cents a piece, today that would be roughly 5.5million.”

But in Dec 2013, 100 btc was worth 100k. December 2017, 100 btc was worth 2mil

Hell, even early 2013, 100 btc was worth 13k.

Point is, yes 5.5 mil today would be incredible on a $30 investment. But odds are you would have sold long ago.

SwagtimusPrime,"The triple Halvening aka the Cliffening is essentially Bitcoin's entire lifespan jam packed into one year.

If we take into account that people are layer 0 and public blockchains follow the will of the people:

Bitcoin's social contract: inflation until 21m coins, 0 experimentation on base layer

Ethereum's social contract: as little inflation (even deflation) as possible as long as the chain is secure, go ham and build cool shit

So after EIP-1559 and the merge, Ethereum and Bitcoin are essentially equal in terms of future supply issuance and Store-of-Value-ness.

Ethereum had a period of higher inflation, however this allowed us to catch so many devs and users by incentivizing them to build on the chain.

What I'm trying to say is: 9-12 months from now, ETH will be just as good a store of value as BTC, in fact it will be better because even under the most conservative assumptions the net issuance will be -0.1% at a minimum, aka deflationary.

However, Ethereum has an absolutely buzzing ecosystem of thousands of dapps and a myriad of usecases beyond just DeFi that we haven't even explored yet, all of them enabled by one fundamental property Bitcoin doesn't have: smart contracts + EVM.

I would just prefer not to post this long page of text if nobody really wants to read it. So just let me know. Cheers!",gw57eb2,2021-04-28 15:22:25,43
daymonhandz,"**This long text will teach newbies about bitcoin and it will also give long time bitcoin veterans many different protocols to look up and research.** This is exciting stuff if you ask me. And no I'm not just some kooky bitcoin maximalist. Some altcoins have merit and a future. Not many of them, but I'm not here to talk about that. Now get comfortable, because this is going to be long. **Just read the bold text if this is too long for you.** The bold text is the summarized version and it contains all of most important information within this long wall of this text.

**Any protocol rule change that doesn't make any previously invalid blocks now valid is called a soft fork.** This would be a miner upgrade and is easier to accomplish, we can give the mining nodes a chance to upgrade, bip9 can be used, or the nodes can just run compatible software.

**All protocol rule changes must be agreed upon by fully validating bitcoin nodes.** Even if the mining nodes don't agree, if the full nodes come to consensus and make a rule change, people will continue to mine as long as it's profitable to mine, so the miners have to deal with it or piss off and other people will mine. The mining difficulty will adjust every 2016 blocks regardless. So when it comes down to it, only the users who run fully validating bitcoin nodes are in charge of bitcoin. 

**Fully validating bitcoin nodes must come to consensus on any rule change that makes any previously invalid blocks now valid, and that's called a hard fork.** This would be a pretty big upgrade, and it would be difficult to pull off with bitcoin because it's decentralized. And that's a good thing.

There is a maximum supply of 21 million bitcoin**, and that will never change. Satoshi designed the protocol so that **miners solve a block every 10 minutes on average**. The block reward started at 50 BTC. **The block reward gets divided by 2 every 210,000 blocks** (4 years if the hashrate remained constant), which we call the block reward halving. The block reward is currently 6.25 bitcoin and the next block reward halving will happen around April 2024. And then the block reward will be 3.125 bitcoin. **The mining difficulty adjustments every 2016 blocks** which is approximately 2 weeks. So if it's profitable for people to mine, then hardware gets turned on and the mining difficulty increases. But if the price of bitcoin lowers so that some hardware is unprofitable to run, then it gets turned off and the mining difficulty decreases. And as the block reward gets divided by 2 every 210 thousand blocks, the **miner fees will continue to incentivize miners to secure the network even when the block reward is minuscule. 

Many users here like to repeat that the last bitcoin wont be mined until 2140. And while it is true that the last satoshi will not be mined until around 2140. It is also true that **approximately 97% of bitcoins will be mined by 2032**, and the block reward will just be 0.78125 BTC at that time. But if bitcoin is worth, for example, a million dollars, then the block reward alone in 2032 would be worth more than the current block reward + miner fees at this time. That's not even accounting for all of the miner fees that they will also be collecting for the transactions that they include in blocks. 

**Bitcoin protocol rule changes are decentrlized and they require nodes to come to consensus.** Bitcoin development is decentralized and Satoshi published bitcoin under the MIT license so that bitcoin is open source and anyone is free to do anything with the source code. Bitcoin has the most users, largest infrastructure, no premine, no developer fund/tax, no leader, longest track record, is the most secure, and the most decentralized, and bitcoins circulated freely for 18 months before ever having any monetary value which can never even be replicated by an altcoin because the genie is out of the bottle now. And unlike the founders of every altcoin, Satoshi never cashed out.

Bitcoin is constantly being developed.  **Bitcoin also has second layer protocols that are constantly being developed and they don't require any consensus.** So anyone can just create second layer protocols for bitcoin and nobody needs to agree on anything. It's up to the users of bitcoin if they want to use various second layer protocols that maximize the user experience. **One of bitcoin's second layer payment protocols is called the lightning network. It's still in beta but it already allows an unlimited amount of users to send and receive bitcoin transactions in milliseconds for extremely minuscule fees.** People can use the lightning network to send peer-to-peer bitcoin payments, they can [buy anything online where Visa debit cards are accepted](https://paywithmoon.com/) using the lightning network, or they can [buy gift cards](https://www.bitrefill.com/) for practicality any big store from [more than one reputable business](https://foldapp.com/) all while using the lightning network. [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/), [okcoin](https://www.okcoin.com/), and [strike app](https://beta.strike.me/faq) have already integrated the lightning network so that people can deposit and withdraw bitcoin using it and [kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) exchange will be integrating the lightning network later this year. For newbies wanting to try out the lightning network, I only recommend them to use [Muun](https://muun.com/) wallet. Muun wallet is very user friendly and it allows users to send and receive bitcoin on-chain and using the lightning network, from the same wallet. And Muun wallet has a good mempool-based miner fee estimator. 

**The lightning network isn't bitcoin's only second layer protocol.** Bitcoin also has a second layer protocol called statechains that allow non-custodial off chain transfers which bypass paying miner fees and waiting for confirmations. There's also various sidechains in development, including liquid network. And there will be even more second layer protocols developed over time.

**Bitcoin is also switching to schnorr signatures and activating taproot this year which will improve privacy, security, and efficiency.** This will also lower the operating costs of running a node and the miner fees for exchanges by an expected 30%. The block size limit is also supposed to be raised sometime in the future which will increase the amount of on chain transactions per second that can be performed, but that may never actually happen because it requires the nodes to come to consensus. NFTs can be done on bitcoin and that's where they were done first back in 2012. **There's also new discreet log contracts, RGB, musig2, coinswap, and various sidechains in development, including liquid network. RGB allows smart contracts to be done using bitcoin. We should also have trustless cross chain atomic swaps available this year. Schnorr signatures also allows us to have point time lock contracts. Taproot and schnorr signatures make it so that nobody can tell if a multi-signature transaction or a trustless cross chain atomic swap has even happened by looking at transactions in the blockchain. They also allow massive multi-signature transactions to be scaled down to a much smaller size.  And much more!**

**Money (not fiat currency) always evolves in four stages** (this is from the *what is money?* section of *The Nature and Creation of Money* chapter of a college course on *Principles of Macroeconomics*). **Bitcoin is currently going through the second stage of the evolution of money, which is a store of value.** The next stage is a widely used medium of exchange. Bitcoin may evolve into the third stage in 5 years, in 7 years, in 12 years, or **bitcoin may never evolve passed the second stage**. The final stage of the evolution of money is a unit of account. Bitcoin is also currently going through price discovery. **Bitcoin's true value needs to be found before it will ever be a widely used medium of exchange.** Bitcoin has a second layer payment protocol called the lightning network which also need to be adopted by the users, merchants, and exchanges before bitcoin can ever become a widely used medium of exchange.",gw58egv,2021-04-28 15:36:01,52

MC_Cookies,"To anybody still confused, an NFT is basically like a bitcoin proving that your version of something is the “real” version, instead of a copy.

The analogy that helped me understand it is an artist’s signature on a piece of their work. If an artist makes 50 prints of a piece, they’ll sign and number them, and any print that doesn’t have that signature is a copy of one of the 50 originals. Technically, these copies are functionally identical to the originals. If you buy one, you still get to enjoy the art in the exact same way as if you had an original. But the originals are more valuable purely because there’s a limited number of them.

In this analogy, an NFT is basically the artist’s signature, digitized. It’s a big unique mathematical thing that exists to be passed around, and anybody that sees it can look at its history of how it’s changed hands.

The reason that NFTs are kinda dumb is that anybody can see the media associated with them - that’s kinda the whole point of the internet, right? So the only thing that’s valuable about an NFT is scarcity, but since it’s backed by literally nothing, it’s only valuable if people want it, and people only want it if it’s valuable.

chuck_portis,"So long as the global crypto market cap keeps going up, it's just a matter of time.  People are just cycling through different alts.  Eventually it finds its way back to BTC and the cycle starts again.  

One noteworthy change each Supercycle is that the alts become more and more advanced each time.  In 2013, the alts were quite honestly pathetic.  LTC, Namecoin, Feathercoin, very early XRP.  Bitcoin Dominance went from near 95% down to the high 80's.

Then 2017 came along and was the real ""coming out"" party for alts.  ETH being the real breakthrough with smart contracts and ERC20 tokens, which led to the ICO Bubble.  This one really had that 1999 tech bubble feel.  People were making altcoins using copy paste technology, desperately trying to make up a use case.  A lot of words, a lot of ""ideas"", very little execution.  Tons of vaporcoins.

Now we have this Supercycle, where the alts are clearly seeing a lot more use cases, largely thanks to DeFi.  Yield farming, collateralized loans, on-chain insurance, synthetic assets, futures and options, NFT's.  All of this stuff is crowding the ETH network and opening doors for other projects to get real utility.  

We are seeing that the multiple blockchains act like multiple highways.  ETH is congested?  People will head over to Binance Smart Chain, MATIC, even Tron.  We are seeing why it's important to have multiple chains.  There are enough transactions to go around at the moment.  This could change if Ethereum really solves the scaling issue, but for the near future, it seems that other blockchains are going to capture increasing volume.

All that to say, it seems as time passes, more and more projects are solving real use cases, and thus we should expect Bitcoin Dominance (BTCD) to ebb and flow, but generally trend downwards.  The good news is, BTCD decreasing is often aligned with Global Crypto Cap increasing.",gw9kpp2,2021-04-29 14:46:11,45

daymonhandz,"You're severely misunderstanding things. Bitcoin is just a protocol, much like TCP/IP are just protocols. The bitcoin protocol also has secondary layer protocols that run on top of it. One of bitcoin's second layer payment protocols is called the lightning network. It's still in beta but it already allows an unlimited amount of users to send and receive bitcoin transactions in milliseconds for extremely minuscule fees. The lightning network isn't bitcoin's only second layer protocol. Bitcoin also has a second layer protocol called statechains that allow non-custodial off chain transfers which bypass paying miner fees and waiting for confirmations. There's also various sidechains in development, including liquid network. And there will be even more second layer protocols developed over time.

It's always possible that another cryptocurrency could replace bitcoin, but there's only one altcoin that currently exists that could possibly do that and I really don't see it happening. Another cryptocurrency could be invented and possibly overtake bitcoin one day, but bitcoin is currently the most secure, most decentralized, most valuable, most adopted, and most fairly launched cryptocurrency that is currently in existence, and it also has the biggest infrastructure and the most users. 

Satoshi didn't create bitcoin to get rich. He created bitcoin to allow online payments to be sent directly from one person to another without requiring trust or permission of anyone else. Over 99% of altcoins were created to enrich their founders and over 99% of them have no future. None of them are as secure, as decentralized, or launched as fairly as bitcoin. Cryptocurrency is full of scammers/grifters, ignorance, and people that actually believe the lies because they've been sucked into shitcoin cults. Gamblers use altcoins for trading/gambling to increase their bitcoin stack or even their efereum stack if they [don't understand bitcoin and cryptocurrency.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T89gsJ2MsG8&amp;t=47m24s) Gambling on altcoins can be very profitable during a bull run because the altcoin market is basically a short term casino where you actually have a good chance of winning. It's a relatively easy way to increase your bitcoin stack.

The issuance schedule and maximum supply are both clearly defined and will never change. If you properly handle your private keys then your bitcoin can't be stolen or seized and nobody can stop you from sending it to anyone else. Bitcoin development is decentralized and anyone can contribute because Satoshi published bitcoin under the MIT license so that it's open source and anyone is free to do anything with the source code. Bitcoin protocol rule changes are also decentralized because they require nodes to come to consensus. This is vastly different from many altcoins. Some other differences are that bitcoin has the most users, largest infrastructure, no premine, no developer fund/tax, no leader, longest track record, is the most secure, is the most decentralized, and bitcoins circulated freely for 18 months before ever having any monetary value which can never even be replicated by an altcoin because the genie is out of the bottle now. And unlike the founders of every altcoin, Satoshi never cashed out. Bitcoin is a scarce tokenized derivative of inflation and corruption that's kept honest and secure by it's own decentralized ledger of value that can't be forged or hacked. Put simply, bitcoin is the hardest money that's ever existed.

Bitcoin is also switching to schnorr signatures and activating taproot this year which will improve privacy, security, and efficiency. This will also lower the operating costs of running a node and the miner fees for exchanges by an expected 30%. The block size limit is also supposed to be raised sometime in the future which will increase the amount of on chain transactions per second that can be performed, but that may never actually happen because it requires the nodes to come to consensus. NFTs can be done on bitcoin and that's where they were done first back in 2012. There's also new discreet log contracts, RGB, musig2, coinswap, and various sidechains in development, including liquid network. RGB allows smart contracts to be done using bitcoin. We should also have trustless cross chain atomic swaps available this year. Schnorr signatures also allows us to have point time lock contracts. Taproot and schnorr signatures make it so that nobody can tell if a multi-signature transaction or a trustless cross chain atomic swap has even happened by looking at transactions in the blockchain. They also allow massive multi-signature transactions to be scaled down to a much smaller size. And much more!",gwdihsz,2021-04-30 10:57:34,82
Malarkeynesian,"I mean obviously the shit with Gaetz is beyond gross, but...

&gt; The letter, which The Daily Beast recently obtained, was written after Greenberg asked Roger Stone to help him secure a pardon from then-President Donald Trump.

&gt; “If I get you $250k in Bitcoin would that help or is this not a financial matter,” Greenberg wrote to Stone.

&gt; “I understand all of this and have taken it into consideration,” Stone replied. “I will know more in the next 24 hours I cannot push too hard because of the nonsense surrounding pardons.”

&gt; “I hope you are prepared to wire me $250,000 because I am feeling confident,” Stone wrote to Greenberg on Jan. 13.

Holy smokes. I have seen a lot of really corrupt shit coming out of the Trump administration for the last four years, and in a lot of ways I've been desensitized to it, but this one made my jaw hit the fucking floor. That is a direct promise of a pardon in exchange for a bribe. Trump was a blur, so I can't remember if it's the *most* corrupt thing I've heard, but it's definitely gotta be top ten.

C01n_sh1LL,"You said ""the bitcoin is real, I can exchange and purchase with it;"" does that mean it's already in a wallet in your possession?

If you're spending any time in that space, you need to be aware that people will be trying to scam you 24/7. Even if you do everything right on your end, from time to time you will get exit scammed, or otherwise defrauded, by pools and exchanges, even the largest most reputable ones. It's an incredibly hostile space.

Generally speaking if somebody is offering to give you more than a dollar or two worth of cryptocurrency, then it is some sort of scam. They might be trying to get your personal information for identity theft or for further targeting on a ""sucker list"" for scams, or they might be working some digital variation on the classic advance fee scam. But the bottom line is you will be spammed constantly with ""prize notifications"" and they are *pretty much* never real. If one *is* real by some chance, nobody needs any personal information or action on your part to send you currency. They need only a wallet address. This is *very important.*

I think it's great that a young person is interested in this technology and in finance in general. I don't want to discourage you from this. But cryptocurrency, for the foreseeable future, should be treated as gambling, not investing. When you log in to that Discord server, imagine you're walking into the seediest most disreputable casino in town, full of losing gambling addicts and the con artists who prey on them.

My advice would be to discuss your cryptocurrency operations with your parents, at least for anything involving sums of money over a few bucks. They would be correct to suspect this sort of thing as a scam. I think if you show good judgement in keeping them informed about these activities early on when very little money is involved, they will be more trusting and less likely to get mad, compared to, for example, if you were to suddenly need their assistance and a bank account to convert a large sum to USD. Parents tend get nervous at the thought of their children being involved with large sums of money from unknown sources sent for nebulous purposes, so the fewer surprises the better, I think.",gwe5p3c,2021-04-30 14:42:05,78

DonutCravings,"Bitcoin has historically seen ups and downs, usually a bullish market a year subsequent to the halvening (2013, 2017, and 2021) followed by a year of bearish market, followed by 2 years of accumulation phase. [Plan B’s](https://www.google.com/amp/s/cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-halving-will-be-make-or-break-for-stock-to-flow-model-planb/amp) stock to flow model is often used to show this. This follows a log curve. 

However, past events cannot predict the future. In 2021, we have both institutions and retail FOMOing as well as progress in clarity around the regulatory front. This does not mean that we may not ever see a 50% correction. We probably will (my opinion). The question is will it correct this week from 50k to 25k or after a continuance of more bull run and correct from 200k to 100k. 

This is all just noise, usually created by a combination and balance of FOMO and FUD. Your best bet is to buy an amount you are comfortable with, and just holding. 

I’ve been in this space for about 6 years and I can definitively say I am not smart enough to time the market, so I just buy a certain amount every week no matter what the price is. I’ve been doing so since 2015 and I plan to do it until I retire.",gwgggox,2021-05-01 03:47:22,76

&gt;The messages show that in November, the pair discussed putting together a “document,” which later took the form of a confession letter and background missive about all the ways in which Greenberg had been loyal to Trump. In their early conversations, Greenberg told Stone that the letter was “about 8-10 pages” and asked if it should be shortened.

I am aware chess is one of your pass. Lets get directly to the point. Not a single person has compensated me to check about you. You may not know me and you are most likely thinking why are you getting this email?  
Well, i actually placed a malware on the adult videos (pornography) web-site and there's more, you visited this web site to have fun (you know what i mean). When you were watching video clips, your web browser started working as a Remote control Desktop with a key logger which provided me accessibility to your screen and also webcam. after that, my software collected every one of your contacts from your Messenger, Facebook, as well as e-mail. after that i created a video. 1st part displays the video you were viewing (you have a fine taste rofl), and second part shows the recording of your web cam, and it is u.  
  
You get two different options. Why dont we take a look at the options in details:  
1st alternative is to ignore this e-mail. in such a case, i will send out your very own video clip to all your contacts and then consider concerning the humiliation you will see. and definitely if you are in a romantic relationship, just how it will certainly affect?  
  
Second option would be to compensate me $2600. Let's refer to it as a donation. Then, i most certainly will straightaway erase your video. You could keep daily life like this never happened and you would certainly never hear back again from me.

MBCnerdcore,"**Dogecoin by design, is positioned as a blockchain version of a fiat currency.  What does that mean?**
________________________________________
Fiat currencies typically do not have intrinsic or use value. 

They have value firstly **through government regulation**.  Since this is a decentralized cryptocurrency, we can replace *""the government""* with *""the underlying tech/algorithms, being updated by developers with 'Litecoin' as a starting line, and 'a great fiat cryptocurrency with secure and fast transactions' as a finish line""*. 

**The only other way that fiat currencies have value, is because parties engaging in exchange agree on its value.**  AKA 1 DOGE = 1 DOGE.  AKA how your local country's CountryBucks works.

Right now the disadvantages to these, the ""problems"" are:

**1) Slow Development** This is currently and ACTIVELY being addressed by the fine folks over at /r/dogecoindev, the Doge development Twitter/Discord, and the Doge GitHub.  The devs are working on implimenting new features to catch Doge up with other mainstream crypto, and if you are a talented dev that wants to help, it's an open-source project and they would love you to lend a hand.

**2) Reputation as a Joke/Meme.**  I'll get to this later, but the TL;DR is that this reputation would be a disadvantage to ""investment"" type coins like Bitcoin but can actually be an advantage to a fiat currency because it creates demand and adoption. 

**3) Dogecoin's lack of ""usefulness"" compared to other crypto.**   ""Usefulness"" is subjective and really depends on the goals of the coin and its dev team.  The bottom line is that, **if Doge is succeeding at its own goals, then it's useful**.  Don't let people move the goalposts for you, each coin is focused on something different, and very few cryptocoins have 'actually using it as an inflationary fiat currency alternative' as a goal, which puts Doge up in the market leaderboard in this regard.
____________________________________
OK I said a magic word:   **Inflationary.**      And I kind of misrepresented DOGE.  DOGE is inflationary in the short term, and deflationary in the long term.

**Inflation is a market force that encourages spending**, rather than 'investing' (AKA hoarding AKA HODL).  The goal of Dogecoin isn't to sell it to get back into Local CountryBucks, **the goal is to spend them directly** on goods and services **as a currency** to avoid being locked into your CountryBucks at the whims of your governments.

All the people talking about ""*Doge can't be $10 because the market cap would be X*"" are actually arguing a strawman fallacy:  Doge as a CURRENCY shouldn't be compared to ""market cap"" like a STOCK.

**For instance:** What's the ""Market cap"" of the Canadian Dollar? Is it higher than Tesla? The GDP of Canada? The GDP of France? Apple shares? The answer is ""Who cares, that's not how regular people measure the value of the Canadian Dollar.""

The only thing that matters, just like with CountryBucks, is 'how much does an ape need to pay for a banana?""

**At an inflation rate of ~4% and shrinking, the supply matters less and less the farther in the future you look.**  There will be Billions and Trillions of Dogecoins out in the world, but that doesn't change the value of DOGE.  Just like with CountryBucks, the side-effect of printing a lot of coins is inflation.  Inflation is actually good for CountryBucks, because it encourages trade.  Money moving around is what gives currency value.

Just like with fiat CountryBucks, more can be printed all the time, but unlike with CountryBucks, Doge inflation is predictable and stable.  The inflation rate of DOGE is pre-calculated into the algorithm. It will never be higher inflation than it is right now. It will take 25 years for the current amount of coins to double.  **People saying Doge has ""infinite"" supply, must be planning on living forever.**  On a realworld practical level, it doesn't make a difference.
__________________________________
Doge is given value not from the flashy underlying tech or the scarcity of coins, but by **retailers accepting Doge as currency**. The more doge is adopted, the more stable the price. When some small companies started accepting Doge, the value went up.  When Crunchyroll, porn sites, and Newegg started accepting Doge, the value goes up even more.  When the biggest retailers (Walmart, Amazon, Netflix, etc) take the leap into accepting it, then suddenly the coin's value will go to the MOON.  And then it will stabilize at some value, and hover there ""un-Tethered"" to any nation's CountryBucks. 

**You can't ""pump and dump"" the EURO.** So that's why adoption is the goal, and DOGE isn't an ""investment"", it's a currency. The goal being - the more adoption, the more stable the value of the coin.  

**""Investing"" in DOGE is as silly as ""investing"" in EURO or Canadian Dollars.**  ^(Unless you know what you are doing -&gt;  See:  Forex trading) 
 The point is to spend them, not to hold them for X years and then sell them just to get back into CountryBucks.  ""Easy to spend at a wide variety of retailers"" is what will make DOGE useful.  Not to support DeFi or smart contracts, not to create NFTs or blockchain videogames, other coins will always be more useful for those things.  So yes, Doge isn't ""useful"" the way something like ETH or BTC is.  But those coins aren't as ""useful"" as an easy, cheap way to spend on goods and services.  
______________________________________________
And **yes, Doge is a meme joke coin.**  But the more people spread it and talk about it, the more valuable it is.  Eventually it becomes Kleenex or Band-Aid but without the IP and copyright problems - **people will be so used to it that the name is synonymous with 'cheap cryptocoin used for online shopping'**.  And in that regard, being a meme is a strength rather than a weakness.  This is the reason VHS beat Betamax, despite the tech disadvantage.  This is the reason Blu-Ray beat HD-DVD.  It's the reason the Nintendo DS beat the Sony PSP.  Sometimes the marketing, the brand name, a few high-profile supporters, is what it takes to be that household name, even against more powerful or useful tech.  In terms of mainstream branding, Dogecoin is probably only second to Bitcoin itself.  This is EXTREMELY powerful and useful, from a certain point of view.
_________________________________
So this is exactly the argument for Doge.  To be used as a fiat currency as an alternative to country-based fiat.  Yes it has downsides and the coin isn't perfect, and the devs have a lot of work to do, but **the constant FUD about Doge having ""infinite"" supply and therefore no value is missing the point**:   Doge and crypto like it should be compared to currencies, not stocks in the stock market and ""market cap"" of Apple or Tesla or the GDP of France.  **The success of Doge is measured by adoption**, not Doge's value to sell off for $CountryBucks.

I hope this clears up some of the 'talking past each other' arguments between shibes and those who can't wrap their heads around 'our goals are different, market cap doesn't matter'.",gwmgvqb,2021-05-02 13:18:45,142

Hattix,"Munger does have a point. If you throw a few million dollars from your pad in NYC to some weird business in Kaliningrad, established Tuesday, authorities are going to have a few questions for you.

Do the same with bitcoin and nobody knows. You can use it as both the concentrator and the transfer stages of money laundering. It's  the medium of choice for ransom payments. Ransomware just doesn't work anywhere near as well without it. It's become the Western Union money transfer of the 2020s for extortion, except it's way better than Western Union ever was.

Allowing very rich and very powerful people to anonymously move their wealth around, as well as criminals to take payments without disclosing identity or location, is not desirable for anyone, yet it is the use case for most cryptos. It gives these ""old rich guys"" (just rich guys really) the ability to sidestep every regulation, taxation, you name it.

This is Munger's problem with it, similar to what Buffet (not unsurprisingly, they're of one mind on it) has already stated.

StrongMindsHold,"The value of Harmony is technology. The onboarding/adoption is a result of value realization. Especially for layer 1 blockchains (Harmony is like a layer 1 and layer 0 combined because of interoperability with other chains and ease/scaleability for Dapp development). No blockchain is valuable without use or adoption. The more people use the chain to hold value, the higher the price (bitcoin). The more DAOs and traditional businesses utilize the chain, the higher the price (etherum). The more active a community is at promoting a chain, the higher the price (doge) The greater the integration into other chains, the higher the price (polkadot, chainlink, etc). However, all of these blockchains have every attribute just mentioned that plays into its price value, most just have a single main focus and grow the rest of the attributes with time and community consultation. Harmony is the leading protocol of efficiency and groundbreaking technology in which other large chains such as BNB and ETH struggle to mimic/model-after. Think of Harmony as a credit union on steroids; as a community, you can store value, earn interest (staking), and even take out loans (albeit through integrated 3rd parties), but you can also grow a new business, integrate into existing businesses to increase transparency and efficiency, base a sustainable economics model from it (look up their balance of issuance and transaction fees), and use as a global currency (yes, with more adoption).

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-06/how-to-decide-whether-to-invest-in-bitcoin-or-ether?srnd=premium-europe

&gt;The Case for Ether

&gt;Ether is the token used on the world’s most actively used blockchain -- the technology used for verifying and recording transactions -- Ethereum.

&gt;Ethereum is used by the likes of Microsoft Corp. for its blockchain offering and has powered the explosive growth in non-fungible tokens, the latest digital art craze.

&gt;“Ether is a blockchain platform that functions like the Apple store or Android app store,” said Pat LaVecchia, chief executive officer of Oasis Pro Markets, a U.S. digital securities trading platform. “Bitcoin is a commodity like gold, or a store of value.”

&gt;Unlike Bitcoin, where many of its core features like its supply cap are baked into the design, the Ethereum platform is evolving. It’s currently going through upgrades that should improve the network, with even a change that will reduce supply. That could boost the price by offering greater appeal while at the same time putting more limits on how many Ether are available.



&gt;“Investors often look at Ethereum as a growth-type investment, making a bet on the continued development of the decentralized ecosystem built on Ethereum,” Phil Bonello, director of research at Grayscale Investments, which oversees trusts that serve vehicles for both cryptocurrencies, said. They “sometimes consider Ether as a way to get index exposure to all the development occurring on Ethereum.”",gx4sukw,2021-05-06 18:59:01,81

CorerMaximus,"Article linked in the article on why NYC may be doing this now:

A decade ago, the bankrupt owner of the Greenidge power plant in Dresden, New York, sold the uncompetitive coal-fired relic for scrap and surrendered its operating permits.

For the next seven years, the plant sat idle on the western shore of Seneca Lake, a monument to the apparent dead end reached by the state’s fossil fuel infrastructure.

But today, Greenidge is back up and running as a Bitcoin mining operation. The facility hums with energy-hungry computers that confirm and record Bitcoin transactions, drawing power from the plant’s 106-megawatt generator now fueled by natural gas.

The mining activity is exceptionally profitable, thanks to an 800 percent rise in Bitcoin’s price since last April. Seeking to ride the boom, the plant’s new owners plan to quadruple the power used to process Bitcoin transactions by late next year.

Environmental advocates view Greenidge’s ambitions, if left unchecked, as an air emissions nightmare.

And they fear that dozens of other retired or retiring fossil-fueled power plants across New York could follow Greenidge’s example, gaining new life by repurposing as Bitcoin miners or other types of energy-intense data centers.",gx560q1,2021-05-06 21:36:55,170

Cryptocurrency are tokens/ coins that actually do something. They can serve as a store of Value (Bitcoin), a currency( Monero), a platform for other Apps ( ETH), with many use cases. They are based on Blockchain,  which decentralizes finance and records,  and stores the info on computers around the world. 

For example you can invest in a project designed to record, validate, and privatize  Medical records. Hospitals and insurance companies may use these in the future. Your records will be private and never lost.

KokoroMain1475485695,"For a currency to be viable it need to be easily divisible, easily accessible and have a stable and recognize value.

I cannot buy food with bitcoin or any crypto. 

Cryptocurrency are volatile as hell.

USD is backed by taxpayers. I can buy grocery food with it and it's value even with inflation is more stable across time than the value of any cryptocurrency.

I can have access to USD for fairly small transaction cost. Bitcoin transaction are slow and costly.

The idea that cryptocurrency will overtake state currency is bollocks.

Cryptocurrency and blockchain as a technology might be use by states on state currency, but a currency not backed by any state will never be able to rivalize state currency.

At best, cryptocurrency is similar to gold to due scarcity. At worst, cryptocurrency isn't scarce because there's an infinite amount of cryptocurrency clones.

At best cryptocurrency have value through its security, but the retail investors don't need crypto security, they need need standard credit card security. At worst the security of crypto doesn't add any value and the value is only based on offer and demand and right now, people are buying crypto not for the technology, but for the get rich quick scheme so there's ''gamblers'' are going to sell to earn a profit. Same for those mining coins. When more people will sell than the liquidity available, the price will tank. It can take 2 weeks, 4 years, 10 years. This make the bitcoin unstable.

If you need to pay wage or if you need to buy anything, the USD will be more useful and convenient and stable than any cryptocurrency ever will.

virus88888888,"🔥🔥🔥 Virus POTD 🔥🔥🔥 Record 30-17-0. Units = +47.43 (WWLWL)

Australian Football 🏉 - Melbourne Demons v Sydney Swans

**Melbourne 1-39 -** ($2.00/+100) - 3 Units

Match starts \~ 7hrs from post

* I'm part **virus,** part human so losses do occur and results could change in an instant. Manage your bets and avoid all-ins. Take note of my unit sizes. Feel free to use my breakdown to your advantage.

KISS:

* Melbourne (WWWWW) are currently top of the ladder 4 points clear and undefeated this season.
* Their last match seemed abit shaky against the weak Kangaroos but still ended strong to defeat them by 30 points. They haven't had much trouble keeping opponents scores low.
* Melbourne's Petracca is having a superb season and is a favourite to win this years Brownlow (MVP).
* Sydney (WLLWW) are 5th on the ladder and expecting Franklin and Rampe to come back from injury.
* Despite their huge loss to Gold Coast, most of the Swans game have been close results.
* H2H: Swans are 9/10 against Melbourne but we can ignore this stat this year since Melbourne have been absolutely trash last few years.
* Prediction: Melbourne by 13 points. Sydney have covered 7/8 of their last matches as an underdog. So expect them to hang in their against a dominating Melbourne side. If you don't have 1-39 margin I recommend going **Melbourne ML** but for lower odds.
* If you like a gamble, I also like total points **Over 151.5**.

BadAssPleb,"Ok to begin with I wanna make it clear this is not written by me so all credit should be given to the OP of this article. Very interesting reading but it is 2yrs outdated, it shows however vechain has been opened about what they are and what they hope to achieve from the beginning. I have chosen not to invest in vechain even tho I believe in the technology, I own LTO instead. 

Anyway here’s the link to his article, https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8i66ug/is_vechain_centralised_or_decentralised_does_it/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf I will repost it here however as to do so that you don’t have to open another window if you’re browsing in mobile. I don’t want any credit for this comment I simply thought this would add to the conversation.


Is VeChain centralised or decentralised? Does it affect their goal to be the leading global enterprise level public blockchain platform?

### TL:DR VeChain is neither fully centralised or decentralised. It is more politically centralised compared to popular cryptoassets such as Bitcoin, however there may be reasons for why the ecosystem has been designed this way. Like all blockchain projects, it lies on a spectrum/matrix of centralisation/decentralisation. 

Since the latest [Medium article: Defining the VeChainThor Blockchain Consensus — Proof of Authority] (https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/defining-the-vechainthor-blockchain-consensus-proof-of-authority-8cf3f51a5fa0), I have seen some members of this sub declare that VeChain is centralised, without further discussion on what this means or the pros/cons. From a governance perspective VeChain certainly appears more centralised compared to Bitcoin. However it is worth noting, the decentralised political system/governance model in Bitcoin is the reason behind multiple BTC forks, the scaling debate, BTC/BCH drama and the difficulty associated with making changes to the Bitcoin protocol. It is myopic to make wide generalised statements about an ecosystem like VeChain without understanding the nuances behind decentralisation vs centralisation and the reasons for one or the other in the first place.

[Vitalik Buterin writes a thoughtful article about decentralisation, I highly recommend it.] (https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274) In his article, he argues that there are three types of decentralisation which run independent of each other. Architectural (de)centralization , Political (de)centralization and Logical (de)centralization.

From VeChain's own description, the ecosystem is meant to be a balance between centralisation and decentralisation. The VeChain [organisation chart](https://www.vechain.org/about#organization) shows the governance structure. ""The Board of Steering Committee oversees the various functional committees within a decentralized foundation. The board members, through a governing agency, ultimately guide units towards cohesive goals and enables collaboration, efficiency, and output across channels. The Board of Steering Committee is the governing body of VeChain Foundation. It represents the balanced interests of the VeChain blockchains stakeholders.""

The VeChainThor network would be 

- architecturally decentralised: authority nodes run on multiple unrelated physical computers, no infrastructural central point of failure
- politically mixed centralisation/decentralisation: authority nodes are made up of different individuals and organisations vetted by the foundation to support the ecosystem, ecosystem development and decisions will be influenced by a central steering committee controlled by 7 members of the board, at the same time this steering committee is guided by many various stakeholders with voting authority, in a sense it is similar to a company structure with shareholders in a company and board members, the relative power of each party is still unclear at this stage
 - This is the key area where VeChain is more centralised and differs from other projects. I believe this decision was made to ensure VeChain would be able to quickly adapt to fluctuating regulatory conditions in the real world. With large-scale mainstream enterprise adoption as the goal, VeChain will happily make necessary changes to their blockchain to foster faster adoption. VeChain are looking ahead and plan to adapt their ecosystem to become whatever the rest of the world requires them to be.
- logically centralised: like most blockchain projects, has one commonly agreed state (the blockchain), the ecosystem behaves like a single entity",gxdfkdp,2021-05-08 18:56:57,126

If Crypto is actually going to become a thing, the endless supply of Doge is actually something that could establish it as a stable currency (something that seems far more difficult for Bitcoin) thus making it a legitimately better currency.

Also, you cannot just throw endless data power on Doge to create infinite amounts. You can only make an amount per day which someone else did the math on yesterday, to show makes up less inflation than pre-covid US Dollar (post covid us dollar inflation would of course, be considerably worse than max Doge inflation).

A currency is a collective belief, only two currencies have the PR pull at the moment to be used as true global currencies, Bitcoin and Doge and while Doge was made as a joke, the technology it was made on wasn't a joke and just might be legitimately better than Bitcoin's.

Doge will not likely ever reach 1.000.000 USD per coin. Probably not even 500.000 USD per coin. But it can certainly hit 10.000 USD per coin and still be considered at a sensible market cap if one considers it a true currency.

What it needs for this is mainstream publicity and ease of use as payment...and I'm seeing people buy coffee with Doge without any hassles these days so when you guys talk about holding past 1 dollar or 10 dollars I honestly just laugh.

You guys think that with the FOMO and Stimulus checks existent in the u.s market this train is going to stop at 1 or 10 dollars?

Once the U.S mainstream realizes they might have found a ""new"" bitcoin at 1~ dollar value the frenzy is going to be shocking. It'll be a bumpy ride getting there, for sure.

daymonhandz,"You're misunderstanding several things and you have a lot of research to do if you really want to understand bitcoin. Bitcoin is just a protocol, much like TCP/IP are just protocols. The bitcoin protocol also has secondary layer protocols that run on top of it. One of bitcoin's second layer payment protocols is called the lightning network. It's still in beta but it already allows an unlimited amount of users to send and receive bitcoin transactions in milliseconds for extremely minuscule fees. The lightning network isn't bitcoin's only second layer protocol. Bitcoin also has a second layer protocol called statechains that allow non-custodial off chain transfers which bypass paying miner fees and waiting for confirmations. There's also various sidechains in development, including liquid network. And there will be even more second layer protocols developed over time.

It's always possible that another cryptocurrency could replace bitcoin, but there's only one altcoin that currently exists that could possibly do that and I really don't see it happening. Another cryptocurrency could be invented and possibly overtake bitcoin one day, but bitcoin is currently the most secure, most decentralized, most valuable, most adopted, and most fairly launched cryptocurrency that is currently in existence, and it also has the biggest infrastructure and the most users. 

Satoshi didn't create bitcoin to get rich. He created bitcoin to allow online payments to be sent directly from one person to another without requiring trust or permission of anyone else. Over 99% of altcoins were created to enrich their founders and over 99% of them have no future. None of them are as secure, as decentralized, or launched as fairly as bitcoin. Cryptocurrency is full of scammers/grifters, ignorance, and people that actually believe the lies because they've been sucked into shitcoin cults. Gamblers use altcoins for trading/gambling to increase their bitcoin stack or even their efereum stack if they [don't understand bitcoin and cryptocurrency.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T89gsJ2MsG8&amp;t=47m24s) Gambling on altcoins can be very profitable during a bull run because the altcoin market is basically a short term casino where you actually have a good chance of winning. It's a relatively easy way to increase your bitcoin stack.

The issuance schedule and maximum supply of bitcoin are both clearly defined and will never change. If you properly handle your private keys then your bitcoin can't be stolen or seized and nobody can stop you from sending it to anyone else. Bitcoin development is decentralized and anyone can contribute because Satoshi published bitcoin under the MIT license so that it's open source and anyone is free to do anything with the source code. Bitcoin protocol rule changes are also decentralized because they require nodes to come to consensus. This is vastly different from many altcoins. Some other differences are that bitcoin has the most users, largest infrastructure, no premine, no developer fund/tax, no leader, longest track record, is the most secure, is the most decentralized, and bitcoins circulated freely for 18 months before ever having any monetary value which can never even be replicated by an altcoin because the genie is out of the bottle now. And unlike the founders of every altcoin, Satoshi never cashed out. Bitcoin is a scarce tokenized derivative of inflation and corruption that's kept honest and secure by it's own decentralized ledger of value that can't be forged or hacked. Put simply, bitcoin is the hardest money that's ever existed.

Bitcoin is also switching to schnorr signatures and activating taproot this year which will improve privacy, security, and efficiency. This will also lower the operating costs of running a node and the miner fees for exchanges by an expected 30% and it will also allow us to use many more second layer protocols that have been developed. This will also allow us to create massive multi-signature transactions that are substantially smaller in size, and will even allow users to aggregate all the multiple signatures of a transaction into one (multiple signers can produce a joint public key and then jointly sign with a single signature). Shnorr signatures and taproot will also allow us to use the coinswap protocol which is pretty self explanatory, the musig2 protocol which will allow aggregating public keys and signatures, new discreet log contracts which increases privacy and scalability minimizes the trust required in the oracle which provides external data for the contract, and point time locked contracts which will improve the privacy of bitcoin payments using the lightning network. Trustless cross chain atomic swaps should also be available towards the end of this year. Schnorr signatures also makes multi-signature and single-signature transactions indistinguishable on the blockchain so an observer will not even be able to tell if a multi-signature transaction or a trustless cross chain atomic swap has happened by viewing the blockchain. NFTs can also be done on bitcoin and that's where they were done first back in 2012. There's also various sidechains in development, including liquid network. There's the RGB protocol which will allow smart contracts to be done using bitcoin on the lightning network. And much more!",gxhffng,2021-05-09 19:14:31,83

Ossified_Squirrel,"Bitcoin wallets can be sorted into two categories. Custodial wallets and non-custodial wallets. Custodial wallets are like unsecured bank accounts. Kind of like banks in the old west. When you put your money in a custodial wallet, the company that runs that wallet has your actual money, but you have access to it. If a “bank robber” (aka hacker) robs the old West Bank (custodian) you’re out of luck.

Now usually banks have better security than you normally do, so it might be ok, but there’s nobody to complain to if the custodian gets hacked. Your money is gone. Most exchanges' wallet (coinbase, kraken, etc.) is this kind of wallet.

A non-custodial wallet puts you in full control. You’re responsible for security, and if you lose the wallet no biggie, as long as you have your secure “keys” saved somewhere. Keys to a bitcoin wallet are represented by a series of random words that you can write down or memorize.

As long as you never digitize these words (no pics, no email, etc) just in your head or on paper, you cannot lose your money, and nobody can take it from you by hacking. There is a saying in bitcoin circles: “Not your keys? Not your coin.”

For small amounts of bitcoin, a custodial wallet is no problem. I keep a little bitcoin in a custodial wallet like cash app or coinbase because it’s convenient. For larger amounts of bitcoin, I would highly recommend using a non-custodial wallet.

Here’s a good rule of thumb. Only keep an amount of bitcoin in a custodial wallet that you would feel comfortable with in your real wallet. So if you carry around $100 in your wallet, no biggie. If you lose your wallet, it’s gonna suck, but it’s not the end of the world. Now if you had $5k , you probably wouldn’t carry that in your wallet.

So if you ever get to the point that the bitcoin you have is worth more than you would carry in your wallet, you should move it to a non-custodial wallet where you control the keys. https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/recommended-wallets.html

If this is a ""medium"" amount of money like a month or two of salary, a non-custodial wallet on your phone is fine.

If it starts climbing into a 6-12 month salary or more, I'd recommend a hardware wallet. I really like the Trezor.

Once you get a non-custodial wallet, be sure to protect those seed words they give you for backup. That is your bitcoin, not the hardware device or your phone. If you have those seed words safely stored somewhere, you can recover from any hardware loss.

If you want to go really secure, stamp those words in metal. I like these cause they aren't expensive: https://crypto-keys.com/pages/jameson-lopp-test

Be sure to never digitize those words. Don't take a pic, dont put them on a computer, etc.. Write them on paper (The trezor comes with cards for this) at a minimum, and put them somewhere secure. If you do use paper, make sure they are in waterproof and fireproof envelopes. If you do decide to go with a hardware wallet, buy it directly from the manufacturer. If its tamper evident seals are broken, don't use it.",gxidwq7,2021-05-10 01:19:56,91

There doesn't seem to be any foreseeable solutions to making proof of stake secure either besides obscuring the flaws. Bitcoin is deliberately made inefficient with proof of work as using provable work that is external to the blockchain is the only means to create real costs where the game theory supports a model where it is both profitable to secure BTC and extremely costly to attack it.
With PoW (proof of work) you would need to be a tremendous amount of effort in order to censor 1-2 blocks with building many asic mining farms, and than burning the electricity continuously in order to attack bitcoin.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncPyMUfNyVM

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUd8ZGgm6Qo

With Proof of stake all I need to do is be an early adopter(s) , hack/kidnap an early adopter(s) , or convince many users to join a interest bearing bank account by staking their coins with my company(done many times before) to attack the network. Since Proof of work involves outside resources one can always objectively see and measure the hashrate and sources in realtime and one can cutoff such an attack because it involves outside resources.

There are many different variations of proof of stake but the simplest way to understand this is by looking at those blockchain's as a democratic consensus mechanism where everyone's vote is weighted based upon how many coins or stake they control. Their staked coins than have an opportunity to create a block without proof of work and a dev controlling 51% of the coins gets to virtually mint ~51% on average of all the blocks . This presents another concern as the coins typically need to be in ""hot wallets"" to do so instead of cold storage leading to a more insecure environment.

Since most PoS coins have massive premines where only a small number of devs control most of the coins this also presents another concern as those devs can be targeted by states , hackers, or attackers or as we often see with altcoin devs they pump and dump a project and than move onto a competing project to repeat this cycle over and over again thus have an incentive to attack their old project.

With Proof of work , seizing the coins or stake of any individual or group of people doesn't effect the process of mining or securing the network directly at all . They can only try and spook the market by dumping coins at a discount while individuals like myself will happily buy up all the discounted coins.
 
PoS is being sought because it is a clever marketing ploy to attract environmentalists who are concerned about the electricity used in PoW mining. They may have valid concerns that I also share but they fail to see all the external costs in PoS.

http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/pos-still-pointless/

Fiat currency and PoS coins cost at least the same amount of resources to  create , regulate and secure as Bitcoin.

There is an inescapable reality for any asset or currency that as it increases in value the production costs and costs to secure increase as well . This is demonstrated in the economic axiom: MC=MR

“Rent” always forces production costs (MC) to always equal sale prices (MR)

PoS currencies and fiat are simply more abstract and complex forms or Proof of Work that use more human involvement (which uses tremendous amounts of resources and has a tremendous environmental impact) as a PoW coin like Bitcoin. Humans instead of ASICs are shouldering more of the work to create, regulate , and secure each of those currencies; This is ""work"" whether it involves burning electricity directly or food and electricity that humans consume  to perform their work. This is an inescapable economic reality. The more valuable something is the more it will cost to secure it because the more effort will be made to steal and or control it. This applies to any currency or asset.

This is also better understood with the dollar auction dilemma. In a hypothetical auction where a bidding war is fighting over the right to mint a 1 dollar bill how much do you think people will be willing to spend for this power ?




1) ASIC's are actually extremely efficient at converting electricity to heat. +99% efficient. This heat can be recycled.

2) Almost all mining is being done with renewable energy right now. Most principally unused hydroelectric in china that would simply go to waste without those ASIC farms capturing the energy

3) When comparing the energy used in mining to traditional fiat you must analyze all the energy consumed in regulation, auditing, accounting, building infrastructure, security, ect to fairly compare the 2 




-------------------------------

100% pure proof of work coins are completely different.

1) They do not legally fit the Howey test as a security. This is not merely an opinion but tested case law in the USA. 

2) A similar amount of effort in securing the coin must be invested to be rewarded the coin creating long term incentives in the project and making it very costly to attack it. Miners who have sunk infrastructure costs on mining a particular algo, especially with ASICs

3)  Fair Coin Distribution.  No scammy ICO , premine or instamine is created and miners are forced to sell most of their coins to cover the expense (mainly ASICs + electricity) which allows a fair distribution and competition in the minting process.

4) Since mining BTC is so competitive, profit margins are typically thin and thus new entrants that either use a better tool to mine (ASIC) or find cheaper sources of power(typically green due to the economics) can quickly gain market share making lasting monopolies difficult. Even if a main ASIC manufacturer appears to have a large market share we can see this quickly change due to a single malinvestment or a mistake when developing the newest ASIC. Power is a resource that comes from many sources and allows many locations around the world to remain competitive for unique reasons. 

5) Objective Security- Proof of work gives us an objective and measurable degree of security where risk assessments can be made with greater precision that isn't afforded with more subjective forms of security.\
 

6) There is no company that controls a pure PoW coin in many cases thus the project will win or fail on its own merit and doesn't have a long burn rate created by speculators",gxijdza,2021-05-10 02:04:57,75

Nobody wants to just say that this is cryptocurrency.  Ransomware is a huge criminal enterprise that only exists because crypto can be used to anonymously collect ransoms.  Bitcoin is the most ""sophisticated"" technology these guys use.  They just shotgun backdoors out there, figure out who they've managed to dupe, and demand a ransome commensurate with that company's financials.  Something like a few day's revenue, such that it'll be paid to get things back online faster than backups/wipes.  It's especially effective when there aren't good backups.

Their software is shit, and half the time they can't decrypt when you pay.  But, there's a thriving market of high paid ""negotiators"" who will help you throw away some BTC.

[https://imgur.com/a/UtEnNi1](https://imgur.com/a/UtEnNi1)

The past couple of weeks have been boring in Bitcoin land.

But…we are maintaining the price in the $50k’s.  That is nothing to sneeze at.  Unless you bought in the $60ks.

We continue to trade in a decent range.  And the formations are creeping towards decent widths again.  This suggests that breakouts/downs might have some power behind them.  But I am getting ahead of myself.

This is a short, boring update.  Sorry…

Here are the numbers:

1.  The formation is currently 6 columns wide.  A move up the column one more box makes it 9 columns wide.  That is getting interesting.

2. Support is at $54,036—which is also the breakdown price.

3. The break out price is up at $59,691.  Resistance is at $58,514.

We have been bouncing around the $50-$60k range since February.  This is one hell of a consolidation.  A we grind through these days consider that we continue to increase the average entry point for the asset.  That makes the base stronger.

tylenol3,"I agree that’s it’s easy to look at the price of BTC and feel like you’ve missed out. But I would suggest 3 things to help make a new investor feel better:
1.	We are likely at the same point in Ethereum’s growth that Bitcoin was at last cycle. It’s a different product that does different things, and it has potential to grow to 5-digit value in the next two years. 
2.	Even if you only invest in Bitcoin, you are likely to get results in the next 5 years that will put any financial product to shame. Unless you’re in real estate, VC for startups, or a small number of other areas that a general retail investor might explore, you are unlikely to find the potential for 2x growth anywhere. Even modest Bitcoin predictions would put it at 5-20x what you would get with most stocks or funds. And you have a very liquid asset that you can use as collateral, transfer quickly, etc.
3.	We are at a point in the curve where there are a lot of coins/tokens with the potential for exponential growth. These are, of course, riskier, but we are only just seeing the beginning of blockchain compute. It has a very high utility and also many act as a solid store of value. If you diversify properly (percentage of investment in crypto, percentages of that based on risk) you will have a tool in your portfolio that has the potential to give you rewards well beyond the typical retail products. 

It’s still 1998-2000 in internet terms. Google was still a niche player. Yahoo and AOL were among the biggest. Amazon was a bookstore. OS X was a buggy beta. Netflix mailed DVDs. MP3s were about as big as disruption had gotten. In the next decade, we are going to see plenty of projects die, but some are going to be the next Web 2.0, cloud compute, and Netflix.

Tesla cars are incidental to Tesla's business, which is selling carbon credits. Plus he's made much more money from Bitcoin than from selling either cars or carbon credits. He campaigns and puts pressure on governments and local administrations to put a carbon tax on *your* car's fuel, just to make his cars seem relatively more affordable. 

He's also a narcissist, claims to have Aspergers (i.e. he excuses himself for asshole behaviour, which is in technical terms either a sociopath or psychopath - I don't know which).

He tweeted to Bolivia: ""We will coup whoever we want!

bitusher,"Lets discuss some of the properties of what makes a good currency and where Bitcoin fits now 


**1) Durability** = Gold is best here due to its history and physical nature. Bitcoin and fiat  being digital in nature means we must compare the  durability of the institution/network that issues and secures them. I would suggest that Bitcoin will slightly excel responsible nation states here and does far better than  unreliable forms of fiat when looking at the history of fiat compared the the history and properties of Bitcoin(2017 gave a lot of credibility to Bitcoin in it thwarting a powerful attack and nation states have repeatedly attacked Bitcoin to one degree or another)

**2) Portability** = Gold is horrible in this category being physical, heavy and unable to be sent digitally(custodians don't count as you lose most the benefits of gold and it switched categories from a bearer asset to registered value). Bitcoin beats fiat here too as its peer to peer , global and lacks regulatory friction. 

**3) Fungibility** Gold wins here. When comparing fiat to Bitcoin it is more complicated but Bitcoin beats fiat here overall and is significantly getting better each year (see link above) . Physical fiat has some advantages over Bitcoin in the sense that its easier to have strong privacy locally as long as the whole ""anonymity set"" (group of users) avoid depositing the fiat in ATMs and banks(physical cash has serial numbers that are tracked with OCR + bill readers everywhere). Bitcoin can be very private if you use the right wallet and you take precautions but if you make a mistake you can also have problems. Digital fiat isn't very fungible or private at all. Thus Bitcoin comes in second here vs gold , although gold isn't as fungible as many people suggest either due to different grading, certifying prices, forms which all fetch different prices.

**4) Scarcity** -- Bitcoin wins this hands down with a fixed and limited supply. ~2-4 million BTc have been permanently lost/destroyed and many people also a long term investors leading to more scarcity. Gold is a distant 2nd with concerns in asteroid mining - (Psyche 16 as an example) and not knowing if any other large deposit can be found but far superior to fiat. 

**5) Divisibility** Bitcoin is already divisible by 8 decimal places onchain and 1/1000 of a satoshi on other layers like lightning. Thus micro txs are possible with bitcoin and too impractical with gold and not as easily done with fiat due to regulatory friction  and costs. The idea is that machines and software can tip other software, machines, and services by the minute or second to allow for more granularity and thus more efficiency with lower prices.

**6) Acceptability** - Fiat wins this category for the time being due to its acceptance worldwide , especially US dollars. Bitcoin being a global currency without regulatory friction can one day overtake even the most accepted fiat however. Almost no one accepts gold for payment so its last and this is unlikely to change. 

**7) Verifiability** - Bitcoin wins here slightly over gold and fiat. Gold can be verified but takes more effort and there are concerns with tungsten filled bars and fake gold. Bitcoin being swept from a private key(coin or paper) or accepting an open dime is better than fiat physical cash, and digital fiat has very large concerns and delays in verification (chargebacks, fraud, etc...)

**8) stability as a unit of account** - While Bitcoin is better than certain forms of fiat in this category, most are more stable than bitcoin and so Bitcoin remains 3rd compared to fiat and gold. We hope that Bitcoin in time will become less volatile with a much larger market cap . This trend is already occurring ,and much economic theory supports this happening but its still an experiment as to how long it will take and what size market cap / liquidity is needed

So you can see bitcoin is already better than fiat in 6 of the 8 categories above and the 2 remaining categories just take time.",gy0xzxa,2021-05-14 06:11:20,165
LargeSnorlax,"Hah, it's funny, I own way too many coins and no one likes to hear the negatives, let's go!

- BTC- Slow, cumbersome, and fees higher than my bank.  Wasteful energywise and largely mined by ASICs unavailable to the general public.

- ETH - Slightly better than Bitcoin in these regards with dubious PoS coming in over the horizon. Development is glacial and fees are through the roof. Creator of tons of crypto waste coins used by scammers around the globe.

- BNB - Fake Defi with a splash of shitcoin, BNB pretends to be leading the space forward while filling CZ's pocketbook instead. Creates mounds of garbage which attract scammers and gamblers.

- ADA - Ghost chain doing less transactions a day than DOGEcoin that develops slower than a snail's pace (ETH) - All promise and no activity. Face of the coin can't even submit a post to /r/cryptocurrency properly.

-  DOGE - Once a lighthearted litecoin fork, now used as a vehicle for scammers and con artists wordwide. Infinite supply and heavy centralization makes investment dubious, even though it was never meant as an investment in the first place.

- VET - Centralized PoS system with spoOoKy authority nodes that operate under the shadows. Terrible gas return for node operators and quirky governance proposals. Under the iron fist of China itself.

- THETA - 10 billion dollar evaluation for a decentralized streaming company whose top streamer has 60 viewers, nothing else needed.

- IOTA - More delays in development than ethereum coupled with more blog posts than a teenager stuck at home during coronavirus. Still haven't found a way to remove the coordinator after over 4 years.

- NANO - You can't even use this network, and exchanges don't accept deposits or withdrawals of it. Everyone was told to remove their NANO from exchanges to decentralize it, but now they can't even sell or trade it when it's going up or down.  Network went down with a stiff breeze and left the community stranded for months.

- BAT - Brave is a great browser, but BAT is worthless. Advertisers don't get bang for their buck because no one has to click on the ads in order to earn BAT, and users don't get any rewards anyways since the amount of BAT given out these days is miniscule. You have to use Uphold to claim it anyways and no one wants to do that.

- MANA - Let's be real here. Has anyone ever actually used decentraland? It looks like a decentralized playstation 1 game in 2021. Graphics 20 years behind the times.

- DOT - This network does less transactions than Monero daily, which is already barely any, and has an evaluation of 40 billion dollars. Even Quantumscape is valued better than this, and they won't have a product until 2025. Come to think of it, that's probably when DOT will have theirs too.

Nachf,"I know this won’t get much visibility. Hell, you may not even see it, but I’ll write it anyways.

We started out bartering. Trade me some bear meat and I’ll give you a bunch of arrowheads. A wolf pelt? I’ll give you these berries.

But there were issues with that. You couldn’t always get what you wanted. If my berries went bad before wolf pelt season was in, I’d miss out on a wolf pelt, and you’d miss out on my berries. So, we started trading gold. It couldn’t go bad, so you could pay me gold for my berries, then I’d pay you gold for your wolf pelts later on.

But eventually, gold became a problem. It was heavy, loud, not as easy to morph and mass-produce coins as we’d like. So we moved on to the bank note. Lightweight, mostly durable, easy to fit in your pocket, easy to make lots of.

Unfortunately, we can’t transfer the bank note at the speed of light, so we started making digital money. Paypal can transfer your money across the world in a fraction of a second.

But now, there’s the issue of security, scalability, and loads of other problems that come with FIAT money. (\*ahem\* inflation during crises)  So, we created DeFi. Nobody owns bitcoin itself. There’s no government to print out more when the going gets tough. No surprise inflation.

But crypto has its issues. The wide array of different cryptocurrencies has turned crypto into a highly-volatile, glorified stock market. And it’s easily subject to manipulation.

It’s time for an improvement. The next step. It will still be crypto, but different. How could we solve this problem, the problem of manipulation from stronger people? I haven’t the faintest clue.

The problems are getting harder. It started out as “Grug need pelt but berry go bad. Grug use intermediate wealth storage to avoid asset depreciation.”  With crypto, it was, “How can I create a decentralized currency, capable of evading the problems caused by the handling of a government? Where the value belongs to the individual, not a higher power.”

This last hurdle is huge. How will we stop a wannabe-Tony Stark from pumping an asset’s value? We can’t just program rules in place or try to take control when the market gets wonky. That’s wholly against what crypto stands for.

Always be on the lookout for new technology. You need to be ahead of the market. Be those people on the bitcoin forums, the people who jumped on bitcoin when it got listed.

There’s a solution. We just don’t see it yet.",gy2u72h,2021-05-14 17:45:30,194

KarmaKaroo,"You can take a very large number (think thousands of digits, magnitudes more than the number of atoms in the universe squared) and put it into a mathematical function that outputs a much, much smaller number. This smaller number is called a “hash”. What is cool is if you put that same big number into the function again and again, it will always output the same smaller number. Another cool property is that there is no way to get from the smaller number (the hash) back to the original huge number, it’s a one way function. 

Another thing to note is that all data on a computer is essentially just a number. That 10 MB PDF that displays text and images? Yeah that’s actually just a gigantic number which can be hashed extremely easily. 

That Bitcoin transaction or block? A number that can be hashed.

The principle behind hashing is P vs NP. The idea is that it is possible to find the original big number from just its small number hash, but the only way we know of to do this is to run through every single big number, throw it into the hash function and check if it’s hash is equal to the target hash. There is an infinite number of numbers, it can take a trillion trillion trillion years to crack some hashes using modern computers.

UpperOrdinary,"I have to disagree about one point: People are not willing to pay a lot for Bitcoin because of the cost put into it. This is a direct derivarion from the *objectivist pricing theory* that the Scottish Classics (David Ricardo and Adam Smith) believed in and that Karl Marx used to define his explotation theory of labour. It is not true that work/effort put into something defines its value. The scholastics were close to define a *subjectivist pricing theory* that the Austrian School of economic thought uses as well beginning with Carl Menger. It is the subjective view on something that gives value; diamonds are not valuable because a lot of work and effort (unfortunately also blood) is put into mining it. All the work and effort is put into it because some individuals are willing to pay high prices for them - more than enough to mine it profitably.

The same logic applies to Bitcoin. It is the sum of all market participants' subjective evaluation which defines the price for Bitcoin, not the value, as value is subjective. The work put into the Bitcoin network definitely is part of Bitcoin, as it secures the network. This security is without doubt part of why people see value in it. But again: This alone is not the reason for Bitcoin's value. If it were so (with anything else), you end up in a circular reasoning: Work (computing power) defines Bitcoin's value, but what gives that work value? The work and thoughts of people working for power plants? What gives value to that? The amount of energy (= food) needed to sustain them? What gives value to that? Again the work put into producing the energy (= food)? But where is that value derived from? The energy (= food) to sustain them? Here we go, a circular reasoning.",gy84uy9,2021-05-16 00:52:19,88

He made over a 100 million selling paypal and that could have been the end of anyone's career. Maybe invest that into some boring investments and live happily for the rest of your life. But he instead worked to make what he believed in come true.

Tesla and SpaceX were his dream and he almost went bankrupt to make them what they are now. I see clips from 2008 and 2009 of people mocking Tesla and calling anyone who buys its shares an idiot because ""Electric cars can never be economically viable"". So much progress has been made in Electric cars because of Tesla. I don't know how far ahead we would be in reusable rocket technology without SpaceX.

That being said, I didn't like how he downplayed the pandemic last year and kept the Tesla factory open even during lockdown. I have also heard that he fired some people who refused to come. He has called an innocent person 'Pedo guy' in the past. And most recently, he propped up bitcoin all these years and boosted its value only to abandon it now causing losses to millions of people (this is one of the minor things because I don't know the details of this story).

Nibodhika,"The theory is that mining rigs can only process 1mb blocks due to Hard Drive and network limitations, so if we increased the block size certain computers that are being used for mining would become obsolete and so the hashtags would be more centralized in the hands of the people who have the mining rigs with more power. And with bigger blocks we would get more transactions so the blockchain would become bigger to the point where introducing a new mining rig that wants to clone the entire chain would take more time.

Take that with a grain of salt, because the people who are more fiercely defending that position are the ones that are also hired by a company that is pushing for a solution called Lighting Network, which depends on the fees for the main chain to be high and would introduce a LOT of centralization (because basically it only works with big centralized nodes as intermediaries).

In the meantime people in 2017 realized that mining rigs could already take much higher blocks and forked the Bitcoin chain with higher block sizes, this fork is called Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Which by itself proves that it is a possible solution.",gyay903,2021-05-16 17:10:20,198

PoS (and modern PoS implementations does seem to accomplish this), then it would be incredibly wasteful not to do that instead.

Futhermore, comparing the energy consumption with gold mining and banking is both 1) irrelevant whataboutism, and 2) not even a favorable comparison because these industries are currently much, much more valuable and productive than bitcoin is, and yet bitcoin uses power in the same order of magnitude as them.

bjman22,"Depends on how many bitcoins you have. Let's say you have 5. So the bitcoins are worth $5 million. You can sell one for $1 million but then you have to pay capital gain taxes. If you bought that 1 bitcoin at $50,000 you have to pay 20-40% of the gains--ie. tax on the $950,000 profit. So to buy a $1 million home you will have to sell more than 1 bitcoin. And once you sell those bitcoins then they are gone--no longer yours. If the price of bitcoin keeps rising you will feel bad that you had to sell your bitcoins to buy a house.

Another option is you go to a company that loans out money for bitcoins (BlockFi, Unchained Capital, others). You deposit all 5 bitcoins and they give you a loan of $1 million. In reality you should take out a loan for more than $1 million--you want to be able to make at least 1-2 years of loan payments from the amount they give you. Notice that $1 million out of $5 million (the value of the bitcoins) is 20% so this is a very 'safe' loan. The price of bitcoin would have to fall about 80% before you are at risk of liquidation. With $5 million in bitcoins the loan companies will give you a loan of up to $2.5 million (50%) easily but that's less safe for you. There are even 75% loans but again these loans are not so safe because you can be liquidated if the price of bitcoin drops 25%. Notice how this week it dropped about 30% !! Yikes !! So, I would only take a 25% loan.

You don't have to pay any capital gain taxes on the loan because it's a loan--you haven't sold your bitcoins. You now use the loan money to purchase the house in cash. Now you must make payments on the loan. The interest rate for these loans is kind of high (6-10%) so what you want to do now is take a mortgage on the home. Since it has no debt a bank will give you an 80% loan--say $800,000 at about 3% interest. You can now use this mortgage money to pay off some of the high interest bitcoin loan. 

If the value of bitcoin keeps increasing--let's say in 2-3 years your 5 bitcoin are worth $10 million then the loan you took out for $1 million is only now 10% of the total amount you have. So now you can take out a $2 million loan and pay off the old bitcoin loan and now you have a lot of cash to continue making payments on the new loan and the mortgage loan. 

The idea is that you are forever in debt and you are paying interest but it doesn't matter because you avoid paying capital gain taxes and you get to have a house without having made the mistake of selling bitcoin for $1 million when now it is worth $2 million.",gyis949,2021-05-18 11:12:33,153

GreyHaredSmuck,"After some investigation it appears that some heavy hitter banks and hedge fund managers shorted tesla as far back as December, since tesla was less than 200 back in august and at 600 or so in December they thought it was a safe bet. Unfortunately Tesla stayed up.  
  
Then Tesla accepts Bitcoin- elon loves all crypto- the banks and hedge funds take advantage and start buying bitcoin and bundling with mutual funds Very risky- The banks and fund managers drive the price of bit up to record levels. Even though bundling any crypto is a huge risk- but hey it was our retirements not theirs  
  
Tesla stock still not going down, Then the media starts beating on the story about fossil fuels and bitcoin some 4 - five weeks ago. Tesla is a green brand- Tesla investigates and finds out its true- Tesla has not choice but to suspend bitcoin until Bitcoin fixes it.  
  
Then walks in Barry from coindesk, the juvenile fanboy war starts between the communities and he will short doge and wants everyone to buy bitcoin- Banks and fund managers are loving it, anything to affect tesla stock,  
  
Then you have Petey also from coindesk, picking a fanboy war complete with name calling- While Elon who has also pointed out deficiencies in Doge (however doge welcomed the input and the doge devs went to work on solutions) , pointed out some of Bitcoins issues. Instead of welcoming the input and working towards solutions, Petey, gets the BIt community to wage war.  
  
Petey then tells his community how to short tesla.... Seems interesting- Who are coindesk advertiser's? Banks, fund managers? Petey also doesn't explain the risk to his followers and acts like, name your price and its a lock, these people can lose their homes! How f-ing irresponsible of this guy!  
  
Next Burry announces his short position, left out of the story is that he has been short on tesla since December and maybe longer- What is not reported is that he did not use millions of dollars to short, he put up 8000. If he fails, and tesla doesn't go down he could lose millions of dollars  
  
This whole crypto community is being used all because a bunch of fund managers and experts decided to take a company down long before Elon said one peep about DOGE or Bitcoin.  
  
Both Bitcoin and DOGE are being used! SO called experts and the Media use Social Engineering - fear and tribalism - to get you emotional and to act in the direction they and their advertisers want you to act. They do this with stocks, they do this with crypto. Be aware.

pm_me_cute_sloths_,"2.0 will be the catalyst that will push it to number 1. The biggest complaint about ETH is the fees, and this practically eliminates those.

Then you have this, which a lot of people will latch onto to prove that ETH is better than BTC because of how much more green it is and how much of a giant it already was in the crypto space. 

Don’t get me wrong, ETH will almost certainly dump a little when 2.0 is released because of buy the rumor, sell the news on top of people being able to sell their ETH staked in Coinbase. Then you also have all the people who want to sell but don’t want to pay the gas fees, so they’re holding until those are better. 

However, once that is all shaken out, I genuinely think ETH will fly past BTC. It just has so much more going for it and is already starting to creep into people’s vocabulary. A lot of people throw around “that Bitcoin” to refer to *any* crypto similar to how parents used to refer to any video game as “playing the Nintendo”, and I think we’re starting to get to the point that people are realizing there’s more than just Bitcoin",gykvo8f,2021-05-19 00:32:48,258

Even if you had bought a Black Lotus back then no one could know the future and it's value. It could have peaked at $50 and be worthless today. Don't regret things you have done in the past because there is nothing you can do about it now. 

Take those experiences and apply it to the future. Maybe spend $100 on the next new technology or buy some stock for a company you think has a unique new idea.

MoccasinLover,"I think what you're pointing to demonstrates a significant degree of overleverage among those investing in and trading bitcoin. Without widespread adoption and upward demand, bitcoin isn't likely to be a good hedge against inflation.

But I think your argument ignores the fact it has some possible value as a systemic hedge during a period of sovereign debt crisis. If you live in a country like Lebanon with restricted access to foreign exchange markets and traditional banks as a result of institional failure, bitcoin offers a store of value that can be kept in self-custody and is not easily manipulated by any central government.",gyq83m9,2021-05-20 03:35:44,143

BitCoin's may supposedly be a 'currency', but it's really not, it's treated as a speculative investment by everyone, and it behaves like a high risk ultra volatile stock.

cjpatster,"Just speculating here, but people converting crypto into non-traceable collectible assets certainly drove some of the price increases we observed on the high end (power 9 spikes, etc).    This pattern in turn may have driven other investors to spike cards down the value list hoping to ride the wave of spikes.  Basically herd mentality driving a lot of movement in prices.                        So as to what happens if crypto crashes?  Well that depends on a few things.  

1) What is a crash?  Recently bitcoin last 50% of its value, sounds bad right?  But it bottomed out at $30K, still miles above its bottom of $4K from a few years ago. I don't texpect these types of fluctuations to impact mtg items.  On the other hand, what if it really really crashes?  Well I don't expect a firesale on mtg items, but I do think that demand will drop because there is less disposable income to burn.  This will cost prices to gently drift downward for a few years until the next major spike pattern occurs.

2) What would drive investors to sell their assets?  Just because crypto is down doesn't mean that you all of a sudden flip your tangible assets.  Lets say you play the stock market and you have a great year and so you buy a vacation house with your profits, lock them in.  Next year stock market is doing bad.  You don't sell your vacation house!  You enjoy it knowing you sold your stocks at the right time and locked in those gains.

Whoeveninvitedyou,"OG doge person here. I kind of disagree with most of the points being made. People love to talk about ""the tech"", and all this research. Most of the tech is experimental, unrealized, unused, or a solution in search of a problem. Which kind of leads into ""what is cryptocurrency""?  Bitcoins use is literally ""a store of value"", meaning you can buy it, and later sell it to someone else for more money. Thats it. It has no other use other than you can sell it for more later. Maybe.

&amp;#x200B;

So is crypto trying to be a currency? If so, inflation is a good thing. Would you really buy a car with bitcoin knowing your bitcoin could triple in value by years end? A small amount of inflation and stability is good for a coin to be used as a currency. Doge is a little slow, but developers have jumped back in trying to fix that problem. Also, I hate the ""doge is inflationary"" argument. Bitcoin is currently inflationary. Its supply increases daily. In fact, before the last halvening, it increased at the same rate as doge.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, I want to point out that the whole ""moon"" meme started with doge, and now ""moon"" is the official cryptocurrency of this sub, and ""going to the moon"" has infiltrated many other subs, and ive even seen it used on CNBC.

AmericanScream,"&gt; Crypto is worth so much because the liquidity is tiny - fact check me on this but the liquidity is probably in the single digit percent mark?

What crypto is ""worth"" is totally speculative.  It's based on popularity more than anything else.

For example, Bitcoin is the most expensive crypto right now, but there are a thousand other cryptos that are built on Bitcoin's code that are functionally identical.   So why is bitcoin worth so much and the others, nothing?   Popularity.     That's not necessarily a metric you want to depend on for long term solvency.

Liquidity is only a problem if you want to cash out.   People are convinced they need to ""HODL"", presumably because the price will go to the moon, but in reality, holding is the only way to keep the market from crashing because there isn't enough liquidity to pay everybody off.  There isn't even enough liquidity to pay 2% of the holders out.",gytvqmo,2021-05-21 00:00:53,94
WarrenPuff_It,"Careful looking into things like this. That video implies that everything happening here is nefarious, when really this is normal human psychology in a volatile asset market. Wyckoff was writing and publishing his work during a period of large-scale distrust of the ""Robber Baron"" generation of American capitalism (1865–1914), and his work represents that distrust and dismay.

We have spent a lot of time and money studying human behaviour over the last few centuries. Since the earliest days of stock markets and hyper-connected global economies, people have looked to everything from math to medicine to help explain human behaviour within markets, in order to gain an edge over other investors. Consider for a moment that almost all of the charts and graphs that we use today to measure markets and prices and trade flows were literally created in the body of literature that was produced to explain the 18th century market crashes, most of which were formulated by William Playfair in 1786 with \*The Commercial and Political Atlas\*. A few key events happened in the world of global finance, and for the most part people only had ledgers and tallies to keep track of these things, whose accounts were spread over various treasury offices and primordial archives so it made comparison very difficult. Playfair gathered data on trade flows and compiled them together to make graphical representations using the first instances of pie charts, line, and bar graphs to visualize these phenomena.

The 19th century saw an explosion of inquiry into the thought processes of humans within markets, as psychology and sociology became growing fields that sought to study and understand human behaviour. Science was rapidly displacing religion and the chief authority for explaining the human condition and experience, and as a result universities began expanding their faculty to include many new fields of inquiry that could help explain why humans do what humans do. One work of particular note comes from Charles Mackay, who wrote and published \*Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions\* in 1841, which was one of the first comprehensive studies of the effects of mob mentality of human behaviour. His work was meant to analysis and interpret the actions of large groups of people through European history, ranging from studies into human grooming habits or the rise of religious persecutions. In the first volume of his series is a chapter that dealt with three important economic bubbles in the 17th and 18th centuries.

The birth of capitalism not only brought new markets and commodities to European cities, it also created cheap information industries and communication networks through newspapers and lowbrow literature, as well as a rising tide of middling classes with money to burn. Mackay argued that unsavvy and greedy investors flooded these markets, which drove up prices and created feedback loops of more investors who wanted to capitalize off new found fortunes, eventually reaching a bursting point and reversal as panic selling rapidly crashed commodity prices when investors fled in crisis. Mackay's arguments were wrong, in hindsight, but his efforts to try and study the affects of human behaviour in markets was incredibly influential for later researchers and economic historians alike. Most interesting was the thought that people didn't act as informed and rational actors within a market, making sound economic decisions based off current market conditions, but rather that people moved as amalgamating masses following people in droves and blindly investing in things that their peers had thrown money into.

The 20th century is when economic thought became highly specialized and sterile in its methods. Economics was increasingly important to growing nations whose trade flows were directly responsible for the health and longevity of the state that administered the markets, and a wealthy public affords a wealthy state, so institutions across the western hemisphere poured a lot of money into studying economics and related fields that could help explain how and why markets behaved as they did. The late-19th and early-20th century was a period of turbulent market conditions and increasing wealth disparity, which gave rise to the popular moniker of the ""Robber Baron"" generation for American capitalists who cornered every avenue of Anglo-American industry and commerce. This period also saw the rapid formulation for new methods of increasing efficiency and output in our economies through the implementation of rigid control methods and statistical observations.

Wyckoff represents the bitterness of that period, as his writings from the end of his life present the riches of that period as nefarious and illicit gains at the expense of the commoner, but his own personal wealth and prosperity was gained through his friendships with and financial relationships with the same robber barons he later despised. The author of the video you linked claims that he devised his methods from studying the trading methods of capitalist elites, and presents that information in a way that paints his as an outsider looking in, when in reality he garnered that information from rubbing elbows with the J.P. Morgan's and Carnegie's of that era, as friends and peers of the elites of Wall Street. He also wrote and sold books about his strategies in \*How I Trade and Invest in Stocks and Bonds\* in 1922 and 1926, similar to how modern day stock traders naturally transition to selling stock pick lists after they have aged out of the stock trading game, Wyckoff's methodology was very much a ""get rich quick"" scheme in itself, as he presented the concept as the optimal time to buy an asset or security based off predictable market behaviour.

There are other metrics that help explain similar behaviour without relying on conspiratorial beliefs.  Just as Taylor's scientific management theory was created to make industries efficient by breaking down segmental parts for any complex system, accountant Ralph Elliott realized that market behaviour could be broken down into constituent parts of the larger whole. He noticed that price action was a byproduct of different groups within the market, buyers and sellers, who were engaged in a constant dispute over optimistic and pessimistic outlooks over the future value of an asset. Buyers drove up prices when optimism was high, and sellers dropped it down when pessimism was high. Elliott first published as ""The Wave Principle"" in 1939, but wrote a more comprehensive thesis on the subject in 1946 in \*Nature's Laws: The Secret of the Universe\*. Elliott Wave Principle breaks down market behaviour and price action into fractals over different increments of time, long term market action moves in waves up and down based off changing market sentiment between bullish and bearish periods, which when viewed from smaller time frames are the same up and down movements in a smaller increment. This is the natural ebb and flow of human behaviour within a free-market, where buying and selling pressure act in a dialectic with each other. The Elliott Wave Principle has been replicated and copied by many people over the years, and can be seen in many macro models that try to explain why price action tends to interact with certain support and resistance numbers.

Despite some of the more popular opinions that circulate social media these days, market behaviour is not the byproduct of manipulation by a select few insiders. That is a rather conspiratorial belief that some people hold, because it makes it easier to explain why things are the way that they are, instead of trying to study the nuanced elements of any complex system. Instead of investing the time and resources to make informed investment decisions, its far easier for someone to retweet ""Elon Musk crashed the Bitcoin market"" and far easier for others to follow in suit. It takes away blame from ourselves and places it on an easily identifiable strawman, so our minds can accept that explanation far easier and quicker than we can accept blame for our own mistakes. People want to believe that the market moved against them because of some malicious actor who controls all the cards, when in reality they were just poor judges of market condition and did not properly analyze all of the facts available to them at a given time. You didn't need to find the special YouTube video or read the right Twitter comment in order to see it coming, anyone who is remotely aware of technical analysis could have told you that markets were overbought and riding on exponential price increases that aren't sustainable over prolonged periods of time, and so a sell-off was right around the corner. We just had a massive cash injection into the economy that people have been talking about for over a year now, during a period of high unemployment and with historically-low barriers of entry for entering financial markets with new technologies and services that lets anyone with a smartphone buy and trade stocks/derivatives/crypto within minutes, on cheap credit, around the clock. That is a recipe for disaster, and when people are circlejerking over a dog-themed dilution machine being the next big currency, maybe it's a safe bet to assume we have entered into ""shoeshine boy"" territory and the markets will experience a downtrend at some point.",gyu6aar,2021-05-21 01:15:01,106

They wouldn't listen when I tried to explain that any business that accepts it is only accepting it because they think they can hold it and make more money off of it than the worth of whatever you paid it for, because they're banking (apparently correctly) on the fact that people are stupid enough to pay for things using a currency that they're literally betting real US dollars (which hold actual, useable value) will be worth more tomorrow than it's worth today.

This is my last comment, which got no reply:

&gt; The only reason Visa accepts it as a form of payment is because the bean counters told them that the potential profit as a result of market volatility was worth the risk of losing some some money if it tanks. Worst case scenario for them is that a tiny fraction of account holders get off paying the full balance, best case scenario is that they make a significant fraction on top of what they already will.

&gt; If you choose to pay your CC bill with a currency that you're adamant will only increase in value (which you would be if you bought into it rather than simply sticking the money in a savings account), you're a fucking idiot. Think of the logic at play there-""I'm going to pay a debt with a currency that I'm literally betting money will be worth more tomorrow than it's worth today."" They're playing you for a sucker and you're falling for it hook, line, and sinker.

&gt; There is no reason for any company to accept cryptocurrency as a payment option except for profit potential. None. Zero. Do you think Dominoes or Visa gives two cold shits about the supposed advantages of a decentralized currency? Do you think they're financial freedom fighters that want to oppose the tyranny of the US Department of the Treasury, alongside the tiny fraction of a percent of the population that actively wants widespread adoption of cryptocurrency? Or does it sound more plausible that the megacorporations are using their acceptance of Bitcoin as both a marketing opportunity and as a potential revenue stream due to its volatility?

Bob-Rossi,"Ya'll didn't ask for it, but I'm posting anyway --- Brutally honest things that need to be said if this community actually wants to flip Bitcoin in the next 6 months post. Time for some unexpected and uncomfortable self-reflection:

* **Ethereum doesn't need Bitcoin to survive.** Stop with the whole narrative that a healthy Bitcoin creates a healthy Ethereum. - This isn't 2017 anymore and at this point it is only a thing because people let it be one. Once Ethereum flips Bitcoin it won't matter beyond daily trading trends. And from a non-price perspective Bitcoin is basically noise. This is something that is true at this moment but is absolutely not true long term.
* **Stop acting like Bitcoin isn't our competitor.** This one baffles me to no end. Ethereum can do everything Bitcoin can. ETH can be sent wallet to wallet, BTC can be sent wallet to wallet. Just because Bitcoin made up some ""Store of Value"" narrative and just because Ethereum does more beyond BTC's capabilities doesn't exclude it from being compared. It's such an easy way for Bitcoin to squeak out of critique that I almost think its some secret type of Bitcoin narrative they push. And frankly it's a disservice to what the devs have accomplished. This is just giving BTC a cop-out for not continually progressing.
* **Bitcoin isn't diversification.** Tons of Ethereum investors feel the need to keep 20% of the stack in BTC just in case, yet not many Bitcoiners do so. That seems to be shifting (and see what happens to the Ratio when it does, *hint hint*). But owning some of each for 'diversification' is just pointless. Both move relatively in tandem and as we saw 3 days ago this whole market can tank together. Diversification is moving into property, traditional investments, mutual funds, so on... not splitting your money between two assets that both went up 1000% in a year. There is no investment reason to think you need to keep some token split of the two if you believe in Ethereum long term. Mental reasons, truly believing in both projects... sure, but if you have a token amount of BTC because you feel obligated its pointless.
* **Don't defend BTC for the environmental FUD (and other** ***truthful*** **FUD) slung at it.** Just stop, please. The narrative that Bitcoin is bad for the environment is an absolute godsend for Ethereum. Take politics out of it and just appreciate there is a large consumer base that values this type of stuff ready for the taking. Particularly companies. Elon's statement should be praised in this sub because other companies are surely doing the same (and will conclude to buy ETH). Your 'job' isn't to defend Bitcoin. Let it wallow in the mess it created because Bitcoin sure as shit doesn't defend us.
* **Marketing isn't a dirty word.** No, I'm not talking Twitter bots and FUD campaigns, but getting the word out and education. This whole concept that ""Ethereum isn't ready"" is baffling. Predictable fees are coming in less then 2 months. PoS is coming by EoY. Scaling solutions are months away and the big one, sharding, is going to be top billing come 2022. Stop being afraid of bring in new people. I know of no other community that tries to keep people out of it like this. Ethereum does so many things right now and keeping it a secret is such a waste. Stop being afraid to pound the metaphorical chest.

Take it or leave it. We are set up so good to flip right now its not even funny. Feel free to argue away, but I feel pretty strongly about all this. Don't underestimate the power of what a community can accomplish.",gyxub62,2021-05-21 22:13:14,103

boooomskii,"Tough convo

How delusional are we all really? Like what the actual fuck?

We do all the research, each coin is different, each coin solves a different problem, each coin has its own value...but does it really? No it fucking doesn’t! 

A $2 trillion market can lose half its value because some anonymous assholes are pissed off about some other guy that manipulated and bought the dip. And as always, we get reminded that our researched, independent, problem solving, world saving, made up digital shitcoin “currency” / “blockchain solution” doesn’t actually have the value we calculated it had, it just goes to shit because Bitcoin got sold. 

How is crypto ever gonna take over if we’re so reliant on bitcoin? How is crypto ever gonna replace anything when someone can just orchestrate a big sell and half our net worth is gone in an hour? How can this replace the dollar? 

Let’s say it did replace the dollar and all currency in 2008. What the fuck happens then when you have your house deposit sitting in your wallet because that’s where your wages were paid into and that’s where you saved and these guys decide to have a dick swinging contest and devalue bitcoin by 50%?? How do you buy/put down your deposit for the house that stays the same price? It’s fucking bullshit. No problems are really being solved by the etheriums, vechains, xrps, if they can became 10% of their value after a certain 4 year “cycle”. If they’re really worth that much, they should always be that much. You can’t just know the value is this but it’s only priced at 10% because of fucking bears in the wild (😅🤣)

I’m not upset and ranting because my investment went down by 50%, I’m still up over 200%. I’m upset because I’m slowly realising that crypto will never really take over. I’m starting not to believe in the technology because it can’t just lose its value over night like that and only be valuable once every 4 years because some guy read a chart that went up because some whales decided to move their money into this asset once every 4 years.

I personally cannot wait to have enough from crypto to start my own side gig and then eventually quit my job. I will still hold my vechain and xrp because of the potential that they could reach “once every 4 years”, but my goodness am I sick and tired of this bullshit whale action controlling and manipulating for fun. Crypto will never take over because of this (not financial advice, I’m not an expert in anything). 

Stocks are no better either. I’m very happy how so many of us have these asshole hedgefunds by the balls with GME and they get a taste of their own medicine. Unfortunately we can’t do that with crypto whales, we bow down to them and panic sell like little bitches. 

Anyway, rant over. 

TLDR - crypto is not going to take over if all cryptos are dependant on bitcoin, which in turn can be easily manipulated by a few anonymous whales for fun and lose 50% in a week! It’s just not right for something that was perceived to be worth $1.2 trillion becomes $700 billion because one guy placed a big sell order because some guy that created Tron pissed in the other guy’s cereal.

Rydersilver,"And here’s just the text of the original article:  


Elon Musk has said the founder of ethereum – the world’s second most valuable cryptocurrency – is fearful of its “joke” rival, dogecoin.
The SpaceX and Tesla CEO was responding to a blog post on Sunday written by Vitalik Buterin, who founded ethereum in 2015. In the post, Mr Buterin countered Mr Musk’s previous claims that dogecoin could be scaled to a level that it could function as a mainstream form of currency.
“As it turns out, there are important and quite subtle technical factors that limit blockchain scaling,” Mr Buterin wrote. “In many cases there are solutions, but even with the solutions there are limits.”
&gt;&gt; Follow all the latest updates with The Independent’s live coverage of the crypto market
Mr Musk responded to the comments via Twitter, claiming that Mr Buterin “fears the Doge”, together with a meme of a Shiba Inu dog mocked up in the style of the poster for the 1975 classic movie Jaws.  

The technology billionaire also reiterated his support for cryptocurrencies in general over traditional fiat currencies.
“The true battle is between fiat and crypto,” he tweeted. “On balance, I support the latter.”

It is difficult to attribute market movements to specific events or comments but Mr Musk’s influence in the space has been notable ever since he announced a $1.5 billion bitcoin investment through Tesla’ earlier this year.
After falling below $32,000 on Sunday, bitcoin has since bounced back above $37,000, prompting a market-wide recovery.
The latest dogecoin endorsement on Monday resulted in an immediate price spurt of around $0.01, though this was relatively modest considering its value has swung between $0.25 and $0.34 over the last 24 hours.
Mr Buterin’s criticism of dogecoin’s ambitions come less than a week after fellow ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson posted a video offering advice to Mr Musk on how to radically upgrade the cryptocurrency.
“If Elon is actually serious about rebuilding Doge with his elite ninja engineers over at Tesla, which I have no doubt he has great programmers there, here’s how you do it,” Mr Hoskinson said, before outlining a not-so-simple 11-step program that would take years to implement.
“Thank you truly for entering our space and thank you truly for telling everybody that you’re going to take custody of that cryptocurrency and make sure it gets where it needs to go, and I look forward to the great innovations you guys come out with in a year or two.”",gzar161,2021-05-25 03:02:18,358

That's true, but the same applies to the $37k in fiat too. If you don't use the money for a car and you invest the 37k to buy one full Bitcoin today, it will will be worth a million dollar one day. So, whichever way you pay the car will cost you a million dollar.

Like an employer of 300k failing one day and now 300k unemployed and no longer spending. Then that causes revenue to fall elsewhere and they fire peoples and it compounds. A failure of a huge employer like that would probably cause banks to tighten lending standards to other employers in the same sector which may cause companies in that sector to downsize its workforce which effects spending power of the fired employees and could cascade to further downsizing elsewhere

Or a bank calling to collect on 300k debtors and some of them call on loans that they may have out on others and enough default and it cascades. Maybe that bank fails and that causes liquidity issues in other companies and things spiral. Credit crunch. Spending drops and an unemployment spiral that bailouts and stimulus try to prevent

Bitcoin crashing doesn't have a cascading effect on jobs and commerce like the failure of huge employers and financial institutions do. Maybe in the future if crypto replaces all currency in the world.

I have friends in Venezuela and El Salvador that use Bitcoin as a way to store their economic value for the long-run, without their money inflating away because of questionable government decisions. Of course, it remains highly volatile but for them its worth it over holding their own shit currency. 

It also solves remittances, where they can receive money from their family halfway around the world without driving to some Western Union 2 hours away that ends up pocketing 30% of the money.

Bitcoin also incentivizes the use of renewable energy and has the potential to stimulate it, I can send you an article explaining this point of view if you like.

If you believe in the traditional financial system and the way our monetary system operates now then maybe Bitcoin and crypto in general adds no value for you, in which case energy used on it is always ""wasted"".

recycled_ideas,"In principle, crypto currencies could be great.

In practice most of them are built by the digital equivalent of gold bugs.

They hate inflation, they hate fractional lending, they hate banks in general.

So they build systems with single ownership of currency, fixed supply limits and a bunch of other things that make actually having a functional currency really difficult.

And, surprise, surprise these systems don't work as currencies, but because they're massively deflationary and because the system is basically designed to cause massive loss of currency, they are extremely good at having hype fuelled dramatic increases in price.

An actual usable crypto currency would have a relatively stable conversion rate to and from real money. 

It would have transaction fees lower than current banks rather than higher than their wildest fantasies.

It would be possible to trace money when it's stolen or used to commit crimes (this is actually possible with bitcoin, but only with enough of the network known) . 

It would be possible to perform all the kinds of transactions we use every day, escrot, credit, lending and borrowing.

And distribution would roughly mirror the holding of actual wealth, however broken that distribution is.

Was living in London after Uni with friends. They got themselves a place (they were a couple) - I did a back of beer mat calculation and got myself a flat on my own. I overestimated my income / underestimated my expenses and was flat broke for 6 months.

Was living back up north making great money. Was very nervous about buying a house so delayed for around 3.5 years (when house prices were going up at 20% a year). Almost had enough to buy outright at that point.

Should have put all my 'higher rate' pay into a pension for the huge tax benefits. Only started doing that a few years ago.

Read a fascinating article about bitcoin when it was around 10p per coin. Decided I would buy a few hundred pounds worth on the off chance that it would take off. No regulated exchanges at the time - so I thought I'd mine some instead. Downloaded software - could not get it to work. Put it to one side and forgot about it.

In other words a Bitcoin video that gets 100k views makes about the same amount of money as a comedy/music video with 500k views, the benefits are that comedy/music channels typically have much larger audiences, since it's easier to find the average person on the street into music and funny shareable prank videos, than videos talking about something as mature as investing.

If I was wealthy and in China I'd want to get my money out of dodge too.

My guess is Singapore is a popular choice because it has the benefits of other economically free countries with none of the language barrier.  If I was a wealthy Chinese person and I was in a hurry I'd put my money in Singapore but I'd slowly try to find a way to move it to another country for a bit of increased safety.  It seems though that a lot of these wealthy Chinese people are opening businesses in Singapore instead, so I guess they have to leak their wealth out slowly instead of as a lump sum.

IllVagrant,"No no no. The argument blames users for what energy producers do to create the energy.

People then took that assumption and ran with it even though the study itself says it's not conclusive or even an accurate model of true environmental impact of bitcoin, only that if electricity being made causes pollution then increased demand might increase pollution. 

The study did almost nothing to address how mining is incentivized to seek out cheap, efficient forms of energy which happen to be renewables.

Hardly anyone citing this study actually read it or even acknowledges it's own professed limited scope. So, many are taking advantage of that fact to parrot a narrative that suppresses the price and adoption.

With US debt now above 100% of GDP, such interest rates would devastate the budget and economy. Moreover, state and local governments do not have the same money creation powers as a national government. For the record, I am also not some crazy “gold freak / Bitcoin, anti-tax conservative”, just an experienced investor and risk manager that has been trained to research history and think through the possible adverse consequences of such economic hopefulness.",h07xgro,2021-06-02 03:10:59,65

GapAFool,"fully expect the down votes here, since everyone hates banks, but hear me out:

* Over draft is something you can opt out of at Chase. Just like you can't spend coins you don't have
* If you overdraft you have until 11pm that day to get positive before you're charged the fee - most other banks charge it instantly , per occurrence and don't give you the grace period. Seems pretty reasonable to me.
* If you read other articles you would know that anyone requesting a covid hardship had the fees reversed. this total was down 10-25% from previous years reported.

Yes, it's a big bank and no one likes a big bank but I don't see anyone handing out free money, except the US Government. Anyone have some bitcoin to lend me? Didn't think so.

It's easy to blame the banks who charge the fees, but how about looking at the people spending above their means? You entered a contract with them to keep your money there, you agreed to the terms. You being unable to ""balance your checkbook"" is not their concern.

People say it's keeping the poor people poor - I see it as people overspending and not taking responsibility for their actions. ""I over drafted by 1 cent, I'm outraged you charged the agreed upon fee"" --&gt; ""Why are you making purchases in the first place if you're not sure you have enough money? 1 cent is cutting it mighty close...""",h08hp2j,2021-06-02 05:43:01,134

In reply to: [NFTs are the modern time share scheme, also Pat is right no one can actually explain how they are good without sounding like they are trying to sell you it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/n5u4dc/nfts_are_the_modern_time_share_scheme_also_pat_is/)

&gt;*""I think they're a scam and I can explain them with a simple comparison. They're like a Letter of Authenticity for a Rolex watch. A Rolex is worth significantly less without the letter to prove it's the genuine article, but the paper is just that, a paper that is not easily ""fungible"" aka it cannot be replicated, replaced, or forged without considerable effort. A fungible item is something like precious metals where any lump of gold is like any other and pretty much interchangeable. An NFT is non-fungible meaning that it cannot be replicated unless you have the original key that produced it in the first place (which you have to possess in order to decode effectively rendering it impossible to guess).*  
*So buying an NFT is like buying the Letter of Authenticity without purchasing the corresponding Rolex watch. You certainly can.... but why in God's name would you want to? The technology certainly has potential for verifying an owner of a work of art, which is why many artists are flocking to it, but as a store of value in and of itself you'd have to be fucking stupid to invest your money in this with the intent to turn a profit. The idiots buying into this will find out soon enough when they realize they've been left holding the bag.""*

NFT wasn't inherently created to BE a scam, it is just one branching evolution of blockchain technology, but like THE VAST MAJORITY of the crypto market, it is the PERFECT platform with which to scam idiots who have never bothered to learn the tech or read the fine print and pumped money in thinking ""surely this will be the next Bitcoin and make me a billion dollars!""

Nobody knows what is going to happen with Chia in the next years, but I have serious doubts about its success. I feel all the attention to Chia came from farming exceptional ROI (+ the fact of being created by the Bittorrent creator). Other than that I struggle to imagine Chia tech outperforming top blockchains today like Cardano or Solana, let alone replacing Bitcoin as storage of value.

Mining reward = block subsidy (newly mined bitcoin) + transaction fees (fees attached to every transaction)

Quote99,"Finally, aspettavo un post così da tanto tempo.

Premetto che di trading ed investimenti ci capisco poco o niente, ma anche dalle mie parti sono schizzate, da inizio pandemia, i profili di conoscenti che anch'essi si spacciano per lupi di Wall street e cazzate simili.

Il tratto comune che ho notato, tra essi, è che solitamente sono persone con una istruzione bassa, solitamente la terza media oppure gente che ha fatto le superiori in istituti poco seri e professionali, che non hanno voglia di lavorare, in sintesi.

Tempo fa, infatti, su WhatsApp mi ha contattato un mio conoscente. Essendo che deve fare fra un anno il mio stesso corso universitario che ho quasi concluso, pensavo che volesse qualche delucidazione, quindi all'inizio gli ho dato corda.

Dopo pochi  minuti dall'inizio della chat mi invia un messaggio del tipo ""Senti, vorresti trovare un modo semplice e veloce per guadagnare passivamente senza fare nulla?"" e, alla visione di quel messaggio, ho fatto una faccia alla Germano Mosconi, con annesso porcone.

Essendo che, quando si tratta di persone che conosco, non mi piace mandare a fanculo direttamente la gente (al contrario dei call center), ho fatto finta di essere vagamente interessato, dicendo che almeno avrei ascoltato ciò che aveva da dire.

Ebbene, la sua grande strategia sta nell'investire tutto in Bitcoin. Wow!

Durante il mio corso di laurea ho fatto un esame a scelta di economia (che non c'entra un cazzo con quello che sto studiando) che spiegava grossolanamente le basi della finanza. Ebbene, con la conoscenza infima che avevo (e che ho tutt'ora) sui mercati sembravo Dio a confronto di questo mio conoscente. Non ha saputo spiegare nulla a riguardo.

Però, ehi, ha il profilo Instagram pieno di foto belle, con orologi di lusso, smoking e macchinoni della madonna. Sarà solo un caso che i suoi genitori cagano soldi dal culo già di base, mica altro!

Se c'è una cosa che sto notando, soprattutto con l'avvento dei social, è che la gente sembra voler impressionare a tutti i costi gli altri, a discapito di andare in malora finanziariamente. Anche quelli che conosco che adesso sono ""trader"", ho sentito da conoscenze che escono saltuariamente con loro che i loro soldi provengono quasi esclusivamente dallo spaccio o attività illecite, e il poco che guadagnano col loro stipendio regolare da cassiere della Bennet lo sperperano nel giro di venti minuti, per comprare cosa?

Esatto, smoking, affittare orologi giganteschi e comprare cellulari. Seriamente, uno di questi soggetti aveva cinque cellulari così, tanto per, perché doveva mostrarli in giro.

E quello che mi fa più pena è il fatto che poi, a soffrirne, sarà sempre la gente con una istruzione più bassa. Perché lo schema sarà sempre così:

Non ho voglia di lavorare e non voglio studiare --&gt; inizio ad entrare in questi giri e/o a diventare anch'io un guru che sponsorizza tutto ciò --&gt; abbandono il lavoro perché sembra prospettare bene questa carriera --&gt; rimango inculato (perché, si, queste cose c'erano anche parecchi anni fa per chi come me aveva già Telegram, l'unica cosa che è cambiata è il fatto che hanno fatto una migrazione di massa su Instagram) --&gt; resto disoccupato perché già di base non mi assumeva nessuno, figurati dopo che ho perso tutto questo tempo a sponsorizzare merda quando avrei potuto veramente investirlo in me stesso imparando qualcosa di nuovo ed apprendendo qualche skill richiesta dalle aziende.

Un po' lì compatisco, dall'altra parte un po' meno. Mi piacciono questi fenomeni perché ti vengono a parlare dei miliardari che hanno abbandonato l'università perché era inutile e sono diventati imprenditori.... Dimenticandosi però che Zuckerberg e Bill Gates sono stati rifiutati da Harvard, e non sono stati pluribocciati alle medie/superiori del paesino di provincia dove se non minacci di accoltellare il prof ti fanno passare...


Perché, in fondo, diciamocelo, se qualcuno avesse improvvisamente scoperto il metodo per diventare ricco non credo che lo vada a sbandierare in giro ai quattro venti aggratis, anzi, penso proprio che se lo tenga stretto per sé, senza farne parola con nessuno.

arismakesmusic,"Before I get downvoted, I want to preface by saying I love both coins, and I feel they each have their place in our society now, and in the future. 

1. First to market. Bitcoin was it. Ethereum was not, and never will be (unless we can figure out how to jump between time). I know that being first isn’t everything, but to the regular aunties and uncles unaware of wtf blockchain is, being first to market has a huge public perception. 

2. Store of value. Bitcoin is proving itself to be a good store of value, and has the potential to take over gold in the distant future. Ethereum has no limit on its cap, and with going PoS, we won’t be sure of any unit limits for a bit of time to come. 

3. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. Ethereum is technology based on the blockchain (this is why I said apples and oranges, above).

4. No one owns Bitcoin. Ethereum is still controlled by a select few that can alter the blockchain, if they were one day to develop some sort of evil overlord complex. 

Anyway, I probably said too much already. I’m still heavily holding both coins, because they’re both going places. I just don’t think comparing their meetups is a fair contrast.",h0lvccq,2021-06-05 05:03:25,68

SpockSays,"You would have to pay an exit tax and renounce USA citizenship to set yourself up for favorable taxation with another citizenship going forward.

USA, Myanmar, and Eritrea are the only countries to impose world wide taxation on its citizens. Americans will have no benefit to the taxation policy in El Salvador.  


For example, if I wanted to live full time in El Salvador because they have 0% capital gains on bitcoin… As an American living in El Salvador, I would still owe the same capital gains to the USA regardless that I don’t live in the USA.

  
If I were anything aside from a USA, Myanmar, or Eritrean citizen… let’s say for example, a Canadian living in El Salvador, I would owe 0% capital gains across the board, because Canada does not impose world wide taxation on its citizens like how the USA does, and El Salvador again has 0% capital gains on bitcoin.

  
It doesn’t matter that Canada has high capital gains taxes on bitcoin for its domestic citizens in Canada. Since there is no world wide taxation imposed by Canada, Canadians have the freedom to avoid Canada’s taxes by choosing to live in another country with more favorable taxes.

  
Only USA, Myanmar, and Eritrea impose world wide taxation on its citizens, and we have zero ability to avoid those taxes, which is pretty fucked up and authoritarian.

  
It really sucks that the USA imposes world wide taxation. As an American, all I want is freedom from worldwide taxation, full stop. It’s not much to ask for considering every other country in the world does it that way. (Aside from Myanmar and Eritrea). For someone like me, renunciation of USA citizenship is the only practical solution to avoid unfair and unjustifiable world wide taxation.",h0vp31f,2021-06-07 14:48:56,80

look_about,"I get real sick of explaining this.  You WANT inflationary monetary policy.

Almost all of the economic forces in a recession are deflationary.  People lose their jobs.  They stop spending.  The things they were spending money on cause more jobs to be lost.  They start spending less too.  Demand falls.  Price falls in response, and deflation is achieved.

Except that makes it worse, because if your money is going to be worth more in a month, you want to hang on to it rather than spend it, so you spend even less.

This is the deflationary spiral that caused the great depression.

This is why the first thing the fed does in any recession is lower interest rates.  They want to increase M2 (money supply) in order to counteract the deflationary pressures of recession.  They do this by loaning money to banks cheaply, who then lend to people that want to buy houses or cars or whatever, and then those people spend money on those things and jobs are created.  Then the people working those jobs spend money on other things etc.  That is how to combat recession 101.

You want a nice stable amount of inflation sitting at around 2-3%.  Too much inflation is bad and deflation is really bad.

As a side note, this is why bitcoin is more akin to digital gold than a currency.  It will never be used as a currency by any nation state because it is, by its fundamental nature, deflationary.",h0xr3s1,2021-06-08 03:17:56,182

Dzugavili,"Because all currency is fiat currency and the only real value is in the products exchanged. As long as we'll exchange currency, it really doesn't matter and when that relationship breaks down, it doesn't matter if your currency is fiat or hard, because you're going to have a hard time exchanging it anyway. Today, fiat currency is just as good as gold, if not better, since most stores won't take gold.

Sure, I can back a dollar with gold, but that doesn't really give it value. Even gold has a floating value based on economic factors such as productivity, supply and demand, and so my non-fiat currency is still subject to the whims of exchange: writing that I back one dollar with one dollar worth of gold doesn't actually tell you how much gold you're going to get for that dollar. As such, it doesn't really matter what backs a currency as long as we can agree it has a value in an exchange, and even gold is no different. When Rome fell, no amount of gold stopped the collapse of the Empire. When the shit hits the fan, currency theoretically backed by gold is still pretty useless if there's no one around to give you gold for it, and no one who wants to trade your useless gold chunks for their useful products. 

Simply, backing currency with metal made sense when the metal was rare and had few or no industrial uses, but that backing still relies on someone desiring it; in a utility-based economy like we operate today, desire is not a property of the large rational actors, and so there is no value in hoarding gold unless you can hedge that against a utility value. In the circumstances where fiat currencies fail, gold doesn't hold its value either: you can't feed a family with gold nuggets.

What most people who whine about fiat currencies don't realize is that our economic productivity today exceeds the value of all the gold we have; and we're pulling about 2% more gold out of the ground year-on-year, further diluting its value. The US would have to obtain all the gold in the world to back the current monetary supply and they would still fall dramatically short. There's also the issue that you could find yourself with a lot of paper and no gold if you misvalued your currency and someone makes a run at the bank. Plus, being able to ""create"" money to inject into the economy is a great way to take out the peaks and valleys of economic cycles.

tl;dr: if the world ended tomorrow, I'd rather have a bag of rice and a box of bullets than a briefcase of cash, a bar of gold and a thumbdrive of bitcoin; and if the world hasn't ended, then my fiat currency is fine as long as the monetary policy running it is adequately controlled; and central banking is simply fiscal insulin for the diabetic apes that run our economic systems into cyclical ruin.",h0yixjw,2021-06-08 06:36:23,229

The truth is I'd have sold 90% of it before it hit $1k, and by now I'd probably have only 2 or 3 coins left, max. Still. That buddy of mine? He is retired, no joke. He diamond handed upwards of 1,000 bitcoin until late 2016 ish when he sold a few to 'make ends meet'. He sold off another chunk when it mooned  over $8k like 5 years ago.

Bomba_Claude,"Very dishonest analysis of how Bitcoin works.....

Calculating energy per transaction is nonsensical - blockchain tech is not just about transacting, the energy keeps your value safe!

When calculating the energy needed per transaction, people pretend that blockchain technology is only about TRANSFERRING value. What people still often miss, is that a blockchain is also meant to STORE value.

When you're only interested in transferring small to medium amounts of value quickly around the world, then you can use a lot of different coins. Especially when you are going to convert that coin again to dollars or euro's for instance.

But this decentralized blockchain thing is not just about transferring value quickly! Being able to store value is an even more important feature.

Many reading this might not have experienced the 2008 financial crisis from up close or don't really know what it's about. In 2008 the worldwide financial system was on the verge of collapse. If it would have collapsed, this would have meant that we wouldn't have been able to do payments anymore, causing a very serious unprecedented crash of the world economy.

How many people realize how important the flow of money really is in a modern world? It basically has a utility function just as gas, electricity and water. We need to be able to do payments to keep our modern world running. The worldwide financial system almost collapsing was a HUGE happening.

And just so people know, there was a time when people understood that payments had a utility function. I believe the Glass-Steagall act made it so that consumer banks (the ones facilitating everyday payments) had to be separated from business banks (these would do the more risky financial stuff).

But then Bill Clinton rescinded Glass-Steagall and consumer banks and business banks could become one and the same basically. In the end this resulted in huge problems in 2008 and the worldwide banking system almost collapsed. And in some countries there were actually bail-ins where the banks would take people's money and confiscate it. There was actually talk by some politicians to sign this type of policy into law. Just imagine working hard all of your life and storing your value with a bank and then the bank taking that value to safe itself because it mismanaged itself.

Decentralized blockchain networks are meant to counteract this whole entire problem that came to light in the 2008 crisis. These new decentralized systems are not meant to just be a solution to banks being very slow with doing payments and charging large fees. We want to move away from the old centralized banking system and therefore we also need to be able to STORE value in a blockchain.

The point of this thread is to show people that the large amount of energy needed to run POW blockchains is to keep the value stored in the blockchain safe from attackers. The energy is not only used to perform transactions and just transfer value. The value stored in the blockchain needs to be very very safe so that people can actually have trust and know that their value can't be stolen by the network being attacked.

When you want to attack the Bitcoin network you will need such a large amount of energy, it's become impossible these days to attack the network from this angle. That's quite comforting isn't it? It's quite comforting to know that if you store your value in the Bitcoin blockchain, that value is safe and you don't have to worry about someone using a bunch of ASIC miners to attack it, as has happened with less secure coins in the past. And you don't have to worry anymore that mismanagement by greedy banks or stupid laws written by politicians will cause you to lose your stored value either.

So in other words, things are supposed to be this way. Don't be misdirected by people that don't fully understand this space yet or by the ones that purposely spread FUD.",h1adca4,2021-06-11 00:07:29,161

Siegs,"My friend and I used to sit in the lobby and try to pick up anyone under level 15 who would load in with us.  We would alternate bringing a bitcoin for them.

About 90% of the people who would join would immediately leave, probably accidentally accepting the invite thinking it was from their actual friends I would guess.

About 70% of the 10% who stayed would be gone before we actually loaded in.

About 80% of the people who loaded in were from regions so far from either of us that they had no chance to stay in the match, they would just DC repeatedly lol.

Of the countless times we tried to do this, only about 5 PMCs were able to stick with us for the raid, but those were some of the most fun raids we had all wipe.  Communicating only through voice lines and flashlights.

One guy we got all across the map, had him loaded up with some decent loot, then some guys started shooting at us in construction, our little buddy was enraged that someone dared shoot at his new friends and he fucking charged straight at them, unfortunately I was already throwing grenades at them and blew him up.

Another time, I died early, and once it was just our little buddy and my chad friend, our little buddy used the DVL we picked up off an enemy and gave to him to cap my friend while he was fighting off an attack.  We were both very proud of him.

The best one though, we literally wiped customs with this dude in tow and he had the pick of the litter for loot, anything his heart desired lol.  About halfway through I noticed he had no backpack anymore, I thought he was just trying to be like us since we had no need for backpacks in this activity.  We got almost all the way to exctract and he came running over to us, ""I NEED FUCKING BACKUP"" he yelled, and we accompanied him all the way back to the main bridge from ZB-011 so he could pick up the backpack he left on a pmc he was looting lol.

— Peter Thiel

Everyone and their mother is calling for a consolidation period or potentially bearish period. You do what feels right. For me, the price does not matter one bit. What matters is that the Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve into an unstoppable monster. 

We have major voices like [Mark Cuban, Gary Vee](https://youtu.be/IuDxdY-H_FY), [Alexis Ohanian](https://cryptobriefing.com/reddit-co-founder-alexis-ohanian-endorses-ethereum/) and [Raoul Pal](https://twitter.com/RaoulGMI/status/1384990265241481223?s=20) supporting Ethereum. We have a [plan to address environmental concerns](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-23/ethereum-closes-in-on-long-sought-fix-to-cut-energy-use-over-99). We have [L2 scaling](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-scaler-arbitrum-is-launching-friday-with-developer-support-from-alchemy) solutions literally weeks away. We have a major economic upgrade that will give miners less ETH to dump in 50 days. We are reducing net issuance to near-zero or [subzero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Zero_(Mortal_Kombat)) within 6-8 months (hopefully). We have an endless amount of companies/celebrities adopting NFTs ([GameStop](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/gamestop-is-building-an-ethereum-based-nft-platform-launches-website/), [MLB](https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-strikes-long-term-deal-as-first-nft-partner-of-candy-digital), [UMG](https://variety.com/2021/music/news/ikonick-bravado-nft-licensing-deal-universal-music-group-1234990543/), [Funko](https://investor.funko.com/news-and-events/press-releases/Press-Releases/2021/Funko-Enters-NFT-Market-with-Majority-Stake-in-TokenHead-Developer/default.aspx), [Tom Brady](https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/06/tech/tom-brady-nft-autograph/index.html), [Lil Dicky](https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/lil-dicky-song-first-music-publishing-nft-1234988224/), and so many others). We have Steve fucking Wozniak who launched an energy efficiency project called [Efforce](https://medium.com/efforce/here-comes-the-megawoz-deep-dive-into-the-efforce-beta-platform-and-its-core-functionalities-c7a9e4da2d74) to tokenize energy savings. We have the [European Investment Bank issuing bonds](https://www.coindesk.com/european-investment-bank-issues-121m-digital-notes-using-ethereum) on Ethereum, and [Visa settling transactions on Ethereum](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2021/03/29/visa-to-start-settling-transactions-with-bitcoin-partners-in-usdc/?sh=1dd2efd05228). We have new names finally grasping the concept of Ethereum/DeFi such as [Cathie Wood](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/05/21189494/not-just-bitcoin-cathie-woods-ark-is-heavily-bullish-on-ethereum-too-what-you-need-to-know) and [Kevin O'Leary](https://cryptobriefing.com/shark-tanks-kevin-oleary-reveals-move-into-defi/). We have major firms like [Guggenheim](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/105935/ethereum-much-higher-utility-bitcoin-guggenheim-todd-morley) and [Goldman Sachs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/05/24/13-trillion-crypto-price-crash-leaked-goldman-sachs-prediction-gives-high-chance-ethereum-will-eclipse-bitcoin/?sh=2f3c014f257a) talking about the flippening. Access to crypto is much easier than it was in the last bull run, with companies such as eToro and Paypal offering crypto, and more to come like [Interactive Brokers](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/09/interactive-brokers-will-offer-crypto-trading-by-the-end-of-the-summer.html). We have a former [ARK Analyst James Wang now writing quarterly earnings](https://draecomino.substack.com/p/ethereum-q1-2021-results) reports for Ethereum, an easily digestible way for non-etherians to digest the insane progress being made. We have a blackhole of liquidity in [DeFi](https://defipulse.com/), [Staking](https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa), and funds such as Grayscale ETHE/Canadian ETFs (and at some point [US ETFs](https://www.coindesk.com/wisdomtree-files-ethereum-etf-application-as-bitcoin-bids-await-sec-decision)). We have [EY injecting $100 million](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/news/2021/05/continued-ey-investments-in-blockchain-market-to-support-increased-demand) in continued development and research. We have former CFTC Chairman [J. Christopher Giancarlo working with Accenture to develop CBDCs](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/digital-dollar-project-to-launch-pilot-programs-to-explore-designs-and-uses-of-a-us-central-bank-digital-currency.htm) and the digital dollar. We have real users [paying to use the Ethereum blockchain](https://cryptofees.info/), along with several projects build on top of Ethereum generating more fees than the top dog. We'll have a [double digit risk-free staking APR](https://twitter.com/RyanSAdams/status/1387393917570723841?s=20) when PoS goes live (risk-free in the crypto world, at least). 

That last point is rather crazy. Consider this for a second... stocks have been the best investment mankind has seen, and have averaged around 10% annual return. Ethereum, off staking returns alone, will beat that, and potentially 2.5x that (not sure for how long). Of course, there is some risk involved, mainly the price exposure to ETH, but that can be offset with a short as [Professor Chaos so eloquently explained in his report](https://twitter.com/SquishChaos/status/1387074095007817730?s=20). 

This is all of the top of my head, so forgive me if I've forgotten a few things. I am bullish on Ethereum, and certainly not selling. If the market decides to take a drip sub $2k I'll be DCA'ing in what I can. But again, you do what is right for you.",h1fk09l,2021-06-12 03:27:34,77

MascotRay,"This may not be popular to say, but since you’re asking for thoughts, here is what I would say:

Bitcoin is king of the market. Whether you choose to invest in it or not, this is the current truth. Right now BTC is so oversold that it puts all alts in a weird spot. If BTC does well, alts bleed. If BTC continues to struggle for a while, alts bleed. Imo, the best thing you can do currently is DCA into BTC because it IS oversold and wait for alts like ATOM to dip further because the chances of them doing so is high. OR, if you have zero interest in BTC, just be patient and hang back for a bit and let things play out. You’re likely to get a better bang for your buck in the next month or so.

As for the investment itself: Please understand that I’m a fan of Cosmos. It’s why I’m here. I’m invested. But also understand that Cosmos is very young. Very promising, but very young. Full of amazing potential, yes. It is also far from a bulletproof investment. Very far. That doesn’t mean I don’t believe in its potential, because I do. It’s just important to be clear what you are investing into and what the risk is. The top five safest plays you can make in crypto right now do not come anywhere near including ATOM. Again, I’m a fan, but understand what you’re getting into. Just my friendly advice since you asked. Good luck 👍🏽",h1gw90t,2021-06-12 10:08:26,89

I also don’t like not owning BTC. It’s a 24/7 365 market.  If you sell, you’ll become hyper vigilant seeking the bottom and setting buy orders.  Timing the market is hard.

This means that the signatures from the multiple parties involved in the transaction can be “aggregated” into a single Schnorr signature. This is known as signature aggregation.

“There’s definitely interesting ideas in there.

I think the number of failures that are outside the model is bigger and more important than the failures that are inside the model…”

LexFrota,"Exactly. People don't understand this, they think everyone should magically start becoming nice and ignore the greedy and selfish human nature.

People will want control, they will want power and money, and they'll always try to create monopolies. 

The difference here is that bitcoin doesn't allow this, not because it will make people nice,  but because it is decentralized. 

The problem with cartels and monopolies is that small players can't get in, and violence keeps the big players on top.

But now with btc, of course big players have an advantage, but the small ones can keep them in check.",h1m182y,2021-06-13 20:28:54,57

kuzkokronk,"Well, the first thing to determine is how much in US dollars would you need to retire, right?

$50K per year adds up to $1 million over 20 years. So, unless you plan on dying in your mid-50s, you'll need a bit more than $1M. I'd probably aim for $2M or $3M to retire comfortably. 

So, how much bitcoin translates to $3 million? Right now that's 83.65 bitcoin (at $35862 per bitcoin).

The question is how much will one bitcoin cost 5 years from now. If the popular [stock to flow model](https://stats.buybitcoinworldwide.com/s2fx/#) is correct (that's a big ""if"") then bitcoin should be somewhere in the million dollar range sometime between 2025 and 2026.

This means you should probably acquire around 3 bitcoin before then.

Of course, none of the above is guaranteed to actually happen. Bitcoin might crash and burn to zero tomorrow. Don't spend any money on bitcoin that you're not willing to lose.",h1ml0z2,2021-06-13 23:52:39,62

cubemacplayer,"I quit working on VFX after 12 years. I was an accomplished VFX generalist that worked in many blockbusters films. Worked late nights and most of the weekends. Then I moved on, got tired of that life and started a business. At the time, there weren't many people doing what I was doing so I was able to succeed. The year was 2012, and  I just had heard of  Bitcoin so I invested all my money in 3 mining rigs, something like 200k USD dollars at the time. I was able to mine around 2000 bitcoins and that's how I started. After that, I spend some of the bitcoins but most of it I kept it.

I also get my late wifes CPP survivorship contributions on a monthly basis. That plus extremely low expenses + a decent passive dividend income flow helps. Also took a lot of the insurance money I got and invested in the market after covid hit so got a nice a return.

* Most important news of the day, it's moon distribution day!!! Riches for all! Show me some love on this thread for an early moon! &lt;3
* The daily ends up at 17k comments. I wonder when we'll see 20k again.
* CMC seems fixed again, and currently sitting at 1.65t marketcap. Which is, according to cmc, an increase of 1200%.
* While Bitcoin dipped below 40k, it has mostly stayed above 40k as is currently the case. Bullish!
* Overal most coins are in the red by a few percent.
* ICP decides to double digit red and fall back under 60.
* AMP pumps some more and sits at 9.4 cents.
* SHIB also does a strong pump. Bearish.
* CHZ goes back over 30 cents.
* On the shilling side, AMP is looking to take over from MATIC for flavour of the week.
* Moons are flavour of the month, just like every month.
* Elon-hating comments see an all time low.
* In the top 100, SHIB, KLAY and AMP are the 20%+ gainers of the day.
* The biggest loser is once again ICP. With KSM/Tfuel coming in as a close second. 13 and 11%.
* In the top 500, ancient BCN pumps over 200%, but on only 150k volume. ORC pumps 56% on actual volume.
* RAI dumps 15% making it the biggest loser. EGR comes close second with 14% Which is bullish.
* /u/hotdogbitchface gets his new coin, OnlySimps listed on CG.
* Volume is still at a poor 88b. I expect this low volume to continue on for quite some time.
* The mental image of the day is spoiled princesses riding bulls, crying and screaming the bulls aren't moving fast enough. ""Daddyyyyyy, I want a new bull! This one is broken!!!!""",h1wzdpi,2021-06-16 10:03:20,59

You want to switch careers in the middle of your prime because what you're doing is unfulfilling? You're reckless

You want to move to a different city or country? You're reckless

You want to put all your money in a technology you strongly believe in and are ready to weather all conditions that are inherent to it, knowing you won't sell it in a panic? You're reckless

Diversification is for those who are not built to take risks in their life. This is likely more than half the population

Ain't nobody gonna ever tell you you should make a risky move. No one wants the responsibility of that on them.

You have to assume your own responsibilities. 

Here is a guy who came into Bitcoin for a reason other than conviction. He's cashed out of it along the way to diversify, because the belief in Bitcoin was either low to begin with, or shaken in the volatility. 

Sir, are your diversified holdings doing better than Bitcoin? 

In the end its about who you are, knowing yourself, and committing to whatever you are deciding on without flinching. 

You do this, you will be much better rewarded. But I mean financially last. You'll be rewarded because you will feel good with yourself for taking a bet on yourself, to go with your own line of thinking above the negativity of those around you.

So first off, really? What makes you say that specifically?

&gt; It hasn't taken off because it's completely vulnerable to spam attacks that can easily cripple the network, which has already happened, which you don't even mention, even though it practically make it worthless.

Nano isn't completely vulnerable to spam attacks that can cripple the network, though. Yes, Nano was spammed, and many transactions were slower than normal. That being said, transactions were still feeless, still secure, Nano was still doing more transactions per second than for example Bitcoin, and had far lower average confirmation times.

To add to that, it lead to a rather innovative anti-spam improvement ([see this article](https://senatus.substack.com/p/nanos-latest-innovation-feeless-spam)), which only served to make Nano stronger.",h22qzio,2021-06-17 20:01:56,203

NanoOverBitcoin,"It’s “underperforming” because there is not really much of a marketing fund. Currently all it takes to be a large marketcap cryptocurrency is chucking a boatload of money at marketing and memes unfortunately. Nano is more of a slow grassroots type of situation. 

I agree that most of the past so called “bitcoin killers” failed because all they did was switch up some properties of a standard blockchain. That isn’t real innovation and isn’t enough to be successful. I personally am betting that Nano differentiates itself enough with its novel blocklattice structure and consensus mechanism. 

Anyway, best of luck to you as well :) I want the most efficient and innovative projects to succeed to make the world a better place and give people more freedom from the current monetary systems. If the future doesn’t end up including Nano, then so be it. But personally I prefer it to Bitcoin at this point in time.

Stock-Lawfulness-332,"I'm an old man compared to most of you here, over 60. I have degrees in computer science and know how to program in multiple languages. I am also a financial analyst and have a master's degree in finance. Let me tell you all a true story that happened to me and give a word of advice for the future. When bitcoin first came out, I laughed it off. Then more and more coins were released.

 I like to keep up with computer technology, even though I'm older. So, I decided to start researching crypto in 2012. I decided to mine dodgecoin with 15 scrypt miners in 2014. By 2017, I had mined 5 million dogecoin. The price of dodge coin had not grown over the previous 3 years so I sold it all for other coins. Had I held the dogecoin, I could have sold for over 2.5 million dollars. The coins I bought with the dogecoin are now worth only about 40000 dollars. I was a writer for dogecoin a big part of the reddit community there. Don't make that mistake with Safemoon. I have been buying 200 to 500 million SM every time it dips under .000004,

 The roadmap for safemoon blows away anything we had envisioned in Dogecoin. The idea of reflections to create a deflationary token is genius. As a professional computer guy and financial guy, this is my advice. If you believe in the roadmap for SM, keep buying if you can afford to. Buy at every dip. If you can accumulate enough SM when it reaches certain levels you can sell half or a quarter of your bag and wait for the next bump up in price. Then sell half or a quarter again. After that, if there is another spike in the price, you could literally live off the reflections.

Let me give you an example:

Right now you can buy 2 billion SM for about 8,000 dollars

If we get just to dogecoins daily volume of 1.5 billion, watch what happens to SM as the price increases.

At .0005 you have 1 million dollars, sell half your coins: you still have a billion SM and have $450,000 in your bank account

At .005 you will have 5 million dollars, sell half your coins: you still have 500 million SM and have 2.25 million dollars in your bank account.

During this time frame, whenever it may be, you will earn more and more reflections as the volume increases. Let's say you have accumulated another 500 million SM through reflections.

At .01 you will have 10 million dollars, but you will earn $3700 dollars a week in reflections. You could literally live off the reflections. 

Make a game plan. Keep buying while the price is still low. Cost average down if you can. Then have a sound strategy for selling later. Diamond hands are hard to keep, I know from experience. I hope this helps some of you. Peace....",h281ohm,2021-06-19 01:04:20,241

* Blockchain
* Game

* Beta Wallet

""Bonuses""

* Harmony One Bridge
* Something Something with The Gambia

Also, Investing in Apple or Microsoft is the equivalent of investing in Bitcoin compared to altcoins: Bitcoin is much less likely to gain 500-1000% in a few weeks, but like Microsoft/Apple, BTC is also much less prone to dropping the same amount.

This would indicate the process will be anything but smooth, especially in terms of market price discovery. If you believe in the legacy system's sustainability in the long term, you probably shouldn't speculate on Bitcoin. If you see this reaction as inevitable and predicted by the game theory built into the Bitcoin protocol, your conviction has probably increased.",h2nvohr,2021-06-23 00:49:14,207

ptoki,"There is a few but they are rare and you usually dont get them.

BUT!

in linux world instead of viruses you can have malware/worms which are kind of close to viruses minus the ability to self spread.

While windows is an environment which is repeated the same way on many computers and its possible to write a program which will be spreading through some windows mechanisms and will be able to run because the configs are very similar across many windows machines its a lot harder to write virus which will take over sanely configured linux machine and be able to attack another one.

The reason is rather simple: 
In windows there are some mechanisms which are automatic, required by system and always available (MS is removing some of them and securing some others but its still possible to spread some code over windows shares, rdp, rpc, explorer behavior, email, word documents etc...)

In linux those vectors are limited, some people use thunberbird email client, some use evolution, others kmail etc.

Some use libreoffice others open office.

Linux file managers tend to not launch any code with no clear permission from users.

The vnc, ssh, X11, rdp clients also tend to not run alien code.

Linux browsers dont support activex which on windows has hefty access to the system (and may be buggy).

Linux will not let the user install and run stuff easily (and that is inconvienient for many) therefore protecting the OS and user.

So as you can see its possible to write linux virus but it will have hard time to spread and its size will be rather big so it will be relatively easy to spot it.

However there is also dark side of this.
If someone will be able to gain access to a webserver (usually through some security hole in website scripts (wordpress had/has? bas press on this) then its possible to spread some malicious data to clients. Like injecting bitcoin mining scripts to user's browsers.

So its not as rainbow and ponies as some people think.

The upside of this dark side is the fact that people collaborate and fix issues plus they help with cleanup if possible.",h2ob7hl,2021-06-23 02:45:26,115

Bad_Investment,"We're no where near out of the woods yet, but this last one felt like a pretty thorough capitulation event. Mass shake out, even bucking some OGs off at least partially. I'm not shaming anyone, **be financially responsible**, but you gotta acknowledge the group hysteria and emotional selling. Sentiment seemed far worse than the first visit down to 1700 as the fear and bear memes had more time to seep in.

I'm not intimately familiar with what is going on but from the looks of it the ""China ban"" is real this time and miners are fleeing out of the country. Bitcoin hash rate is dropping and there is plenty of footage floating around of facilities boxing up their ASICs. Miners are some of the largest holders in the space, not to mention other Chinese firms, and they've been liquidating simultaneously. Meanwhile on-chain data shows plenty of whale accumulation during the sell off. The fact that we're still over 2k after all the panic and forced liquidation in China is pretty impressive, especially considering how overheated retail speculation has been.

You can talk about how the charts are ""broken"" all you want, and maybe so, but at the end of the day that has very little bearing on the adoption trajectory of this technology. The proposition of a multi-year bear market seems preposterous. Perhaps I'm in denial, everyone thought the same in 2018, but clearly things have changed a bit since then. Even after all the noise the world is *still* sleeping on one of the most disruptive technologies we'll see develop in our lifetimes. A total market cap of 1.4T is honestly hilarious.

Tricky_Troll,"I think people are seriously sleeping on the dramatic effect of a change to the supply side of the supply/demand = price equation. The whole 4 year crypto cycles have historically revolved around Bitcoin's halvenings since they dictate the constant selling pressure from miners who have to sell to cover their operating expenses. The merge and EIP-1559 will literally dwarf a halvening. After the merge there will be no more constant miner selling at all. So if we are within 6-12 months of this being implemented, and the Bitcoin bull run usually starts shortly after the halving, continuing for about 1.5 years after the fact, then the proposition that we are about to enter another 3 year bear market just sound silly now, doesn't it?

Therefore, I can see one of two things happening from here:

1. This is just a mid 2017-esque crash exacerbated by Chinese miners shutting down operations and we still break $10K by the end of January 2022.

2. The 4 year cycles are a thing of the past and/or there is a flippening and BTC doesn't take part in this post-merge ETH bull run. Independent of which of the above happens, the supply shock post-merge leads us to a bull-run peaking in late 2022 to early 2024.",h2qxrmy,2021-06-23 17:35:05,63

livedbaron12,"I didn't how to creat post correct so then I'll post it here:

&amp;#x200B;

Today was russian Twitch podcast on Shina4 channel with Nikita and female EFT streamers.  
  
My summary can be not correct because I'm not english native speaker and I did some mistakes.  
  
I try to add all main things on my opinion.  
  
If some summary already created, plz delete this.  
  
I apologize for my english:  
  
In the beginning they talked a lot about female part of Tarkov community. Nikita talked about his wife for example.  
  
As Nikita told before, the game will be more hardcore and this their global goal. And they want to create Tarkov as intellectual game and because of that they want to add a lot specific things .  
  
Nikita know exactly how many people playing in Tarkov. 13% - female players in Tarkov. But they didn't know this is real 13% female or just males who choose female in menu. Nikita want smth (event or any activity) to praise part of Female community  
  
Entrance in labs will be from Streets, factory and another map(mb more). Price of Lab-cards will be lower in the future. Labs (maybe) will be like Dungeon, you should enter and exit from it. They didn't how to regulate number of people in Labs. MB they create instance like 10 players enter from one entrance, and 10 from another entrance.  
  
Nikita dont want empty Streets. Nikita said raid time streets will be hour thirty minimum. Some of entrance will be easy to camp.  
  
Nikita want to improve insurance part. He want connect insurance with scavs(scav carma) and cars. Insurance=scavs. Scav reputation will control unsurance( price ). One of two new traders will give some insurance services(like take your gear from labs).  
  
Scav will be able to raid Labs after Streets release and they can do it as a group. Raiders will able to exit from Labs to Streets. And He reminded abot dynamic boss spawns.  
  
They didn't know will be Boss events regular or not. They know how we liked it. They still think how to realise it correct.  
  
Arena will have team dm, team vs team e.t.c player vs team, team vs pve 1v1 etc. Players will achive honor points(ranked points) and that will be player main goal. Achive points will give lvls. The player's level will give access to different modes like mode with bets, ranked mods etc. If u have main game u can use your in game(EFT) loadout if u don't have main game u can choose preset loadout. You will loose your gear if you use you own loadout. They will try to separate players with EFT and players without it. They still didn't how to monetize Arena. He said Arena need different servers and a lot of money to buy it. Nikita know about butthurt EODowners and arena MOST LIKELY will be in EOD. BUT again they still didn't know but if arena will be in EOD it will be fair enough on Nikita opinion. Arena-Players can earn money like in EFT raids. Nikita want add bets to the Arena, like you team and enemy team can bet on their own victories. Nikita thinks they should rework network system for Arena. He want to see CS mechanics in EFT.  
  
EFT support will be long like EVEonline or WoW. He didnt like COD style support.  
  
Nikita loves dedicated fans who are into the game and the development of the game. And They look to them more than others(talked about new ideas or opinion).  
  
First offline map will be tutorial map.  
  
He want to add new events like Bitcoin event and Fuel crisis. Nikita didn't like situation when players farm bitcoin for 3-4 month. He said it was like utiopia, like communism. And they will try price balance like this events (tarcoin for example).  
  
They thinking about increasing cycle of leveling(more grind perhaps). They want to add new secure container - Amicron. It will be 4x4 container and u can put items only before the raid(that mean u can't put items in container in raid). He want to add global fraction quest. He want to unite players with this global quest. He want add in dailychallenges collective quest(for example players can complete quests together, I think it will looks like in classic MMO). They want add all plot-quest before release.  
  
They planning to add mechanic when players can heal other players.  
  
They finnaly understand how to create unconsciousness and players can imitate this condition(like fake death)  
  
12.11 12.12 etc will change a lot of things with mechanic weapon breakage. Maybe they will add weapon explosion.  
  
no date for unity2019.  
  
Wall destruction can be added on other maps(like factory and dorms in customs)  
  
Lighthouse will be before Streets. 2 bosses, hard USEC base, one exit with train. Size will be between Shoreline and new Woods map and will be looks like Shoreline and Woods. Now a lot of people working on lighthouse.  
  
no information about patch-date and wipe-date.",h2tul0j,2021-06-24 09:02:23,159

BurnerAcc987654321,"Hey all,

Still here. Happy to give an update:

My numbers look worse than 2 months ago, but I'm still up about 4x on the original amount I saved up, and I'm willing to wait it out, as I did in 2018. I believe bitcoin will still work its way up to $100-250k within the next 3-5 years, and I'll start taking profits again at the start of that range.

Right now my allocation is as follows:

* 46% cash (Yes, it did help that I took a little more profit when you guys suggested,  thanks)
* 21% Bitcoin
* 21% Ethereum
* 12% stocks (The cash is slowly moving over here over the next few months).

Life-wise: 

We're now in Aberdeen as planned. We've bought some camping gear to go wild camping in the Cairngorms soon, it's gorgeous up here... Can't see myself living in Manchester again any time soon. 

That cash position covers us for about 10 years with our current expenses, so my focuses right now are learning to invest in stocks properly, learning to code and running (when I'm not too lazy).

I still want to get some cash coming in though, and also, too be honest, I feel like a bit of a loser not working, so I'm looking for a part-time job that's a good fit and isn't very stressful. Trying out one on Monday actually, not sure it's right but it'll be a couple of hundred quid even if I just do the week. There seems to be plenty of jobs in Aberdeen, I've had 4 offers so far for part-time jobs, but unfortunately, 2 of them were customer-facing and I'd rather stay hidden in the back. I'm also trying to get some admin work on UpWork,  I got the 'Rising Star' status, but I need to apply for a few more jobs before I can say whether it's any good or not. My girlfriend already has a part-time waitressing job which could cover half the bills.

Like if the federal reserve wants to increase the money supply(say because a global pandemic that decreases demand happens, but this would never happen of course), they would have to mine or acquire more BTC. This would could also cause deflation, and despite what Coin-Anon thinks, deflation is pretty bad, because it causes people to horde their money and spend it less.

Mr_Evil_MSc,"I recently realised that the fundamental issue with Bitcoiners is that they’re trying to argue (and comprehend) global economics from a kitchen table perspective. They want ‘money’ to be ‘wealthy’, but they fail to grasp that ultimately money is neither the input nor the output of the economic machine, it’s the lubrication. Bitcoin fails as a means of exchange (for many reason, but critically) because it’s own value is dictated by the value of *actual money*. When you can use Bitcoin to broker a deal between corn and chickens, then you might have something, but that requires it be backed up properly by a significant force, and a *legal authority*; that’s what the dollar provides. That’s what they can’t (or won’t) grasp.",h2wospy,2021-06-25 02:33:09,168

roryshoereddits,"It’s incentive for a blockchain network. In blockchain, many computers/nodes/people simultaneously run the network by using their computer or hardware to constantly run the blockchain algorithm. This helps to either mine the coin into existence or to facilitate a transaction on the network. No one will willingly give up their computer, hardware, capital, or energy for “the greater good”. Gas fees are what is paid to the miners, people who run the nodes, or stake pool operators as incentive for them to run the network and continue to process and monitor transactions (buys, sells, transfers, etc) on the blockchain network.

Safemoon will make this process a bit more inverse as the gas fee will be taken and burned from the supply so the incentive is then passed onto the holders to keep holding as they receive that gas fee from every transaction. I believe this is where the mesh network comes in as each individual phone or device that runs the wallet/network will probably be running the algorithm akin to how Bitcoin uses mining rigs and gpus. Hence, big things at play here.

Edit: for contrast and potential clarity: our current fiat financial system also has “gas fees” in incentives to run the network which translates into bank fees and payment processing fees and alike.",h2x49hk,2021-06-25 04:27:57,77

I wish I had recorded it because what I told him was completely different from what he said.

&gt;AmericanScream attests to never owning any cryptocurrency

That's also false.  I said I got into Bitcoin in the early days and even set up my own mining rigs.  I told him I actually have bitcoin wallets sitting around on old hard drives that I have no interest in cashing in, mainly because I don't want to have to cough up my SSN to some shady exchange, or deal with the mess.  Not worth it.  Don't need money that much.  Don't want to take anybody else's money either.

The core of my discussion with the author of that piece was pretty serious about how concerned many of us are that the whole thing is going to implode - that as technologists, the real offense is crypto and blockchain pretending to be some innovative technology.

In the process of explaining why I would take this up as a cause, I said, ""Have you ever heard of Richard Dawkins?""  He said ""No"" which I thought was interesting.  ""He is an evolutionary biologist that may be best known for being anti-religion.  The thing is, he wasn't always anti-religion. He couldn't care less what religious people did, UNTIL evangelicals started attacking his field of work and suggesting evolution was phony and the earth was 6000 years old.  This is the way I feel.  I'm a technologist.  When a bunch of shysters come along and tell me their goofy ideas are factual about 'blockchain being the future' I can't in good conscience not react. They're spreading lies in my field of study.""   None of that seemed to interest the OP... just whether we were a bunch of ""bitcoin-hating"" goofballs.

There is a point to all this though, its for security. If any one person managed to have the same computer power as more than half the network, they could destroy it by issuing fake transactions. Since so many people and companies are mining though, it would be insanely expensive to own 51% or more of the network, so its secure. If it was just 1 or 2 guys mining though, anyone could come along and destroy the network by just buying more computers.",h36rw1n,2021-06-27 15:37:48,132

AutoModerator,"Hi Lapinot, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain fake job scams. Fake job scams come in many different varieties, though most share common characteristics that you can use to spot the scam before becoming a victim. The scammers will usually conduct interviews over Google Hangouts or a similar online service. Their English will be awkward, and they may be re-using a script, so Googling unique sounding parts of the email may yield useful results. They will offer high wages for the work being done, and they will ""hire"" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country. If they mention anything about a check or about receiving and sending out transactions, it is a [fake check scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/anatomy-fake-check-scam). If they mention anything about receiving, processing, or inspecting packages, it is a [parcel mule scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam). If they ask you to purchase items up-front, ask you to pay a fee in order to be hired, or ask you to purchase gift cards, it is an [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). If the job involves posting advertisements on Craigslist or eBay, they are using you and your account to scam people. If the job invovles Bitcoin ATMs, it's a [scam](https://coinatmradar.com/blog/avoid-scams-dont-use-bitcoin-atm-when-someone-asked-you/). Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

eburnside,"Thank you, it was a pretty tough time. When I started in early 2012 BTC/LTC was pretty much still funny money to most people, I think the majority had mined their own vs buying it. I was running the exchange as a ""evenings and weekends"" side hobby and had a full time job working as a VP for a publicly traded company.

When the SEC reached out in mid-2013, Bitcoin was brand new to them and they had 4-5 other crypto frauds on their plate, so I think we immediately got lumped in with those and the initial conversations were pretty tense. I was worried they'd seize the servers, and I knew if that happened everyone's crypto would be gone, so we had to work pretty rapidly to educate the SEC on crypto, and that Bitcoin doesn't automatically mean a scam, and especially that my platform wasn't a scam.  Part of that, as you guessed, was also teaching the lawyers.  We started with securities lawyers and I spent many hours at a whiteboard in their offices explaining Litecoin/Bitcoin.

Once that was settled, we next worked to determine if the platform could operate legally. When I started with LTC in early 2012 it was essentially virtual video game money, but very rapidly (eg, with the big BTC run up in May 2013) crypto had turned into something far more substantial. The regulations weren't there yet for us to register (If I remember right, the fine was for ""operating an unregistered national securities exchange"", IE, on par with the NASDAQ kind of thing) or to get an exemption to operate, so we had to shut down.

I spent the next couple years winding it down.  We allowed traders a month or two to close out their positions, then spent another several months working to get everyone their withdrawals. Not everyone was paying attention, so the withdrawals dragged halfway into 2014. Then for much of 2014 and 2015 I fielded requests for tax records. During that time I'd even added new features to the exchange to download [bitcoin.tax](https://bitcoin.tax) compatible CSV's so that everyone could do their taxes.  We always had good reports in the platform and good records downloads, but the [bitcoin.tax](https://bitcoin.tax) format made it really easy to just take the CSV and go plug it in on [bitcoin.tax](https://bitcoin.tax).  Final shutdown for the servers was mid-2015.

The whole thing was a pet project that entire time. I was doing all the dev work, the operational security, the sysadmin work, the customer service, etc.  Had I lived anywhere but the USA, there's a good chance it would have been Binance before there was Binance. We were already doing more volume than Mt. Gox some days.  Fun times.  :)",h3es39k,2021-06-29 14:41:31,184

Karatekan,"I don’t think either of his points are very accurate.

Bitcoin isn’t anonymous, it’s publicly recorded on a ledger. The people making and receiving payments can be anonymous, but both researchers and law enforcement have proved perfectly capable of figuring out who those people are. If anything, cash is more anonymous, and most crime is domestic. In the next 10 years they are going to start going after people on back taxes, and it REALLY won’t feel anonymous anymore

And Bitcoin is 12 years old at this point, and it has already crashed and exceeded those previous highs. It may be volatile, but that doesn’t mean it is a novelty. It could still crash to zero tomorrow, but people are buying it based on a perception of future value and can extrapolate based on past performance, which makes me think it probably won’t.

I think Bitcoin is eventually going be subsumed, not as a cryptocurrency, but as an asset.

In the old days, the bitcoin mess was small and nobody took them seriously and it was a bunch of nutters announcing that one day all the world's currencies were going to be replaced by bitcoins, and we all had a good laugh.

https://news.yahoo.com/china-bitcoin-crackdown-trillion-dollar-103308054.html
&gt; 
&gt; Michael Saylor, CEO and founder of MicroStrategy has criticized China’s ongoing action against Bitcoin (BTC), saying it will prove to be “a trillion-dollar mistake.”
&gt; 
&gt; Appearing on Bloomberg Technology, the entrepreneur told Emily Chang, “China had 50% market share of bitcoin and they were generating $10 billion a year, in a business that was growing 100% a year, year-over-year.”
&gt; 
&gt; He went on to opine that the Chinese government’s crackdown has “squeezed the [bitcoin] industry out of China.”
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Saylor also said that this action is a tragedy for Chinese miners. Over the last few weeks, the crackdown forced miners to move their operations overseas, with the United States proving a popular destination. More specifically Texas, due to their cheap energy prices and pro-crypto government. Reports indicate that Bitmain, Blockcap, Argo Blockchain, and Great American Mining are rumored to have moved their operations there.
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, Francis Suarez, Mayor of Miami, said earlier in the month that his city would welcome the displaced miners. 
&gt; 
&gt; MicroStrategy increases BTC holdings
&gt; Emily Chang also dedicated part of her interview with Saylor to discuss the current BTC dip. On June 21, MicroStrategy added a further 13,005 BTC to its already considerable holding, which now totals at over 100,000 BTC. Valued in excess of $3 billion. 
&gt; 
&gt; Asserting that the CEO had “bought the dip”, Ms Chang then asked if he had considered the possibility that the dip was actually “part of a prolonged slide.”
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Saylor answered that China’s “rushed exodus of capital and mining” is currently driving the crypto market dynamic.
&gt; 
&gt; He went on to refer to his company’s own strategy as “long-term” and assessed that BTC is for property what the iPhone is for music. 
&gt; 
&gt; “Bitcoin is the dematerialization of property,” he explained. “We’re sucking the value out of gold and real estate and other property assets and collectibles and art. We’re putting it on a blockchain, we’re giving it to the people. It’s a long-term trend; it’s a million times more efficient than hauling your property around on your back.”
&gt; 
&gt; The CEO later took to Twitter to reiterate some main points from his interview. In one tweet, he said “If you want to give joy to 5 billion people, you need digital music. If you want to give knowledge to 5 billion people, you need digital books. If you want to give wealth to 5 billion people, you need digital property.”",h3l4jjv,2021-07-01 02:59:36,117

Yes, these are fantastic news for Bitcoin:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; * Bitcoin mining gets more decentralized.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; * Bitcoin mining gets more clean (renewable energy sources).
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; * Bitcoin miners in other countries become more profitable.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; * Bitcoin miners all around the world get cheap mining rigs from China.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; * Mining difficulty automatically adjusts as per protocol, neutralizing the effects of less (or more) mining rigs coming on/off line.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; * This kills the FUD about: “China controls Bitcoin!” (China will have no miners, no exchanges, no nothing to ‘control’)
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; * This kills the FUD about: “Bitcoin uses dirty energy!” (Bitcoin mining uses mainly clean energy but in China part of the mining was being done with coal).
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; * This kills the recurrent FUD: “China bans Bitcoin!” (there’s nothing left to ‘ban’ for them in the future).",h3l4vc1,2021-07-01 03:01:57,77

CoopTrading,"Hey buddy I’ll be honest with you it could go either way my reason for this is - it is very oversold and that could indicate most traders expect the price to continue depreciating - however it also indicates (in that number range right there lol without looking through a few more indicators for confirmation) that the security is oversold and a price rebound could be coming. However with the recent turn of events most people are predicting the price of mains to fall a bit more (trust me I know none of us want it) and many events could trigger that. For instance a Bitcoin billionaire passed away yesterday. Meaning his family has inherited one billion dollars. What reason do they have to hold? They’ve got more than enough either way right? A sale like that would drop us to below 30k which would no doubt trigger stop losses and bring our price down to close to 20k (or fretfully even worse) 

HOWEVER if they do hold - and or sell bit by bit - then we may be able to continue with our accumulation phase which is what leads us back into a bull run. That being said all I’ve referenced was the price of mains - WE also have allot of great big things going on - however if BTC price falls you can bet BNB will also which makes our liquidity worth less, and tokens worth less, and people sell. 

It is really difficult to say what move to make and when exactly without learning - market psychology- human psychology - emotional intelligence- Japanese candlesticks, and whichever indicators you end up finding work best for you. (Best to learn a good assortment) believe me I know it’s a TOOOON!! But you’ll be able to make incredible choices in the future - behaviorally you will act and feel more intelligent and you will start to see the bigger picture of the overall world.

Before I got into crypto i was already into digital privacy, in fact it is one of the things that attracted me to bitcoin in the first place.

I believe we are headed to a digital privacy crisis, in many ways we are already there but things can still get worse. As authoritarian privacy practices continue to develop on the web, i predict a big surge in privacy coins and I believe monero has the best tech among the options. If major exchanges ban them it will only drive the price by making it more scarce and there will always be ways to exchange it.

As for XLM, I think it will take off in the developing world. Due to its extremely fast network and extremely low fees it can accomplish the borderless payment system that BTC was supposed to be. While I don't think the currency is perfect, i think it could also start to break into the smart contract game. Its very developer friendly because it does not require devs to learn a new coding language, instead its uses a series of sdks to allow devs to write stellar contracts and transactions in their favorite languages like python and javascript. It has the name recognition, so while i don't see it as an ethereum killer i still think it has a chance to get a nice chunk of smart contract market share. bullish",h3osc2q,2021-07-01 23:47:05,161

A 30ish guy very casually asked me how much for the hard drive and I told him I’d have to call my son at college and ask what something like that is worth, and the guy said ‘tell ya what I have to leave right now and I’ll give you $300 right now for it because it fits my computer perfectly yadda yadda….

ApoIIoCreed,"&gt; Every other fork, the people that changed the name have the new chain and the people that kept the name have the original chain.

Hardforks are much more common in Ethereum than in Bitcoin. Since Ethereum is still a WIP, they need to use hardforks to incorporate new upgrades. In almost all of the hardforks 100% of the ETH community agrees to switch over to the new forked chain.

There was a hardfork back in April 2021, and another one is planned for later this month. The pre-April Ethereum chain was totally abandoned after that fork, since it wasn't controversial. 

The DAO fork was unique in the sense that it was extremely controversial and some people decided to keep that original chain going. 

Ethereum classic is still functioning, but there are very few projects built on it -- the NFTs and DeFi projects are built on Ethereum.

Medical-Ad-3660,"I know this is going to be controversial, but I hold zero bitcoin, for quite a while now. A year or two after its release it was praised for anonymity, and low fees in comparison to central banks, which both proved to be incorrect after what i believe to be the fall of the silk road, and I know, it had to get the bugs sorted out. Then the advantages were directed fully to it being decentralized, running on the blockchain which is to this day its soul purpose ( and to essentially ""stick it"" to the big banks ). The new developments in the crypto world in the last couple years have made incredible advancements. There are certain coins that do not impact the environment, they're fees are nearly non existent, transfer times are sub 1 minute and some even contribute to health care, mineral extraction and other real world applications. I understand the true value per single bitcoin stems from its limit of coins, but where I am lost is how the difference in market caps have managed to stay relatively similar over these recent months, and still, bitcoin leads the majority of coins for price fluctuations. It seems as tho a big part of its price is also related to its nostalgia in the market, seeing as there are many coins in which the advantages and benifits greatly outweigh that of bitcoins. Personally I think there will be a switch in top market caps somewhere down the road once the crypto world starts taking notice to some of these other coins, or im completely out to lunch here. I'm not saying bitcoin is a bad investment, because its not. I'm just saying that there are better options out there, which could end up flipping the narrative. I would love to hear other reasons that prove why bitcoin holds the value it does and why it is still king, because I really don't see any advantages and benefits related to bitcoin that haven't been developed and improved on  by some of these other coins.",h3xgo22,2021-07-04 00:38:37,59

bitusher,"Bitcoin is P2P currency. Storing bitcoins on exchanges, banks or web wallets makes you insecure and makes the whole ecosystem insecure indirectly by centralizing bitcoin. 

Bitcoin is a bearer asset with ~immutable txs unlike fiat. This means that internal or external thieves  prefer to target what they can take and won't be reversed like digital fiat. Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks. 


There are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties

You are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft 

You are exposed to exit theft 

You are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit

You place Bitcoin as a whole under more systemic risk by tempting exchanges to use fractional reserve banking and giving them too much influence

You potentially reduce the probability that your investment will appreciate in value because no exchanges are doing provable audits and they might be fractional. The more Bitcoin you personally control the more likely it will appreciate in value.

**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet, custodian , or exchange . You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys.**",h3yg7ot,2021-07-04 05:48:00,72
Ossified_Squirrel,"Bitcoin wallets can be sorted into two categories. Custodial wallets and non-custodial wallets. Custodial wallets are like unsecured bank accounts. Kind of like banks in the old west. When you put your money in a custodial wallet, the company that runs that wallet has your actual money, but you have access to it. If a “bank robber” (aka hacker) robs the old West Bank (custodian) you’re out of luck.

Now usually banks have better security than you normally do, so it might be ok, but there’s nobody to complain to if the custodian gets hacked. Your money is gone. Most exchanges' wallet (coinbase, kraken, etc.) is this kind of wallet.

A non-custodial wallet puts you in full control. You’re responsible for security, and if you lose the wallet no biggie, as long as you have your secure “keys” saved somewhere. Keys to a bitcoin wallet are represented by a series of random words that you can write down or memorize.

As long as you never digitize these words (no pics, no email, etc) just in your head or on paper, you cannot lose your money, and nobody can take it from you by hacking. There is a saying in bitcoin circles: “Not your keys? Not your coin.”

For small amounts of bitcoin, a custodial wallet is no problem. I keep a little bitcoin in a custodial wallet like cash app or coinbase because it’s convenient. For larger amounts of bitcoin, I would highly recommend using a non-custodial wallet.

Here’s a good rule of thumb. Only keep an amount of bitcoin in a custodial wallet that you would feel comfortable with in your real wallet. So if you carry around $100 in your wallet, no biggie. If you lose your wallet, it’s gonna suck, but it’s not the end of the world. Now if you had $5k , you probably wouldn’t carry that in your wallet.

So if you ever get to the point that the bitcoin you have is worth more than you would carry in your wallet, you should move it to a non-custodial wallet where you control the keys. https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/recommended-wallets.html

If this is a ""medium"" amount of money like a month or two of salary, a non-custodial wallet on your phone is fine.

If it starts climbing into a 6-12 month salary or more, I'd recommend a hardware wallet. I really like the Trezor.

Once you get a non-custodial wallet, be sure to protect those seed words they give you for backup. That is your bitcoin, not the hardware device or your phone. If you have those seed words safely stored somewhere, you can recover from any hardware loss.

If you want to go really secure, stamp those words in metal. I like these cause they aren't expensive: https://crypto-keys.com/pages/jameson-lopp-test

Be sure to never digitize those words. Don't take a pic, dont put them on a computer, etc.. Write them on paper (The trezor comes with cards for this) at a minimum, and put them somewhere secure. If you do use paper, make sure they are in waterproof and fireproof envelopes. If you do decide to go with a hardware wallet, buy it directly from the manufacturer. If its tamper evident seals are broken, don't use it.",h3ynexb,2021-07-04 06:53:13,261

En China prohibieron la minería, así que los que están allá se están mudando a diversas partes del mundo. Esto hizo caer la cantidad de mineros en la red e hizo bajar la dificultad. Cuando se terminen de asentar va a volver todo a la normalidad. Un 15% de los mineros abandonaron completamente, según estiman. 

En qué afecta esto al resto de los mineros? Existe una mayor probabilidad para ellos de resolver los bloques. Es como jugar una carrera sin la mitad de los mejores corredores.

En qué afecta esto a nosotros mortales? Nada. Es temporal. La gente que compra placas de video no son los que tienen operaciones de minería a gran escala. Y los mineros en gran escala no minan por el valor del dolar, minan criptos. Ellos ven el mundo en BTC y ETH. Los chinos van a volver a funcionar desde USA y Europa principalmente.

Ahora, si esto no nos afecta, por qué está bajando el precio de las placas de video? Por que por un lado el precio del BTC cayó 50% desde su punto mas alto. Muchos ya no ven incentivo en minar y venden sus placas de video, y ya no hay tanta gente comprándolas para minar por que creen que no vale la pena la inversión. Y por otro lado se está recuperando el stock. Hay tiendas en USA donde ya hay placas de video en estantes. Esto es el principio del fin. Solo es cuestión de tiempo hasta que los que vendan se cansen de esperar que no se las compren. Va a tardar mucho tiempo en que vuelvan a precio de lista.

Y con respecto al mundo cripto, si bien el precio del BTC cayó muchísimo, todo indica que estamos a mitad del ""bull run"" desde un punto de vista técnico. Va a haber una segunda ola de euforia. Esto ya lo tienen en cuenta muchos mineros aficionados, que no se van a ver tentados en dejar de minar ahora y van a seguir para poder vender lo que minaron en unos meses. De ahí que no vemos una ola de gente vendiendo placas de video usadas.",h3zqdi6,2021-07-04 13:35:44,180

GrinbeardTheCunning,"From a business perspective, Ethereum is the best choice because it is the most established smart contract platform.

Most developers, most development tools, most widely known...

This means you have a larger pool of people you can hire from and more tools readily available that those potential hires have experience with. The ethereum community has done a lot of trial and error already, which means the company using the platform won't have to make these mistakes themselves (and suffer the costly consequences...) .
Just imagine them releasing NFTs and get hacked in their contracts, resulting in financial damage for their customers! 


TLDR:
To my knowledge, no other smart contract platform has so many developers, tools and experiences under their belt. Also, it's the most well known ""brand"" other than Bitcoin. 
This saves time, reduces production/marketing costs and improves contract security because best practices are already established and battle tested in real life.",h40q3y6,2021-07-04 22:12:42,506

First, to avoid being put in an asylum or kidnapped to a secret government lab, your 30-year-old ass has to put on a convincing 5-year-old act. That means going to preschool with other kids, suffering through playdates, pretending you can't read, not being able to enjoy the media you like, for years and years. 

You can be smart, but not too smart as to be suspicious. So that's years of grinding through grade school math and reading, dealing with other kids who all know there's something off about you even if the teachers can't tell, and exercising eternal vigilance to avoid being witnessed doing adult things or having adult thoughts. You have no financial resources and no agency. You love your parents, but it's a terrible burden having to play-act the happy child when in reality you don't want to run around on the playground with a bunch of kids. 

You're consigned to at least 10 years of celibacy, and then after that you have to decide between waiting another 15 years for an age-appropriate relationship or basically becoming a pedophile and obtaining sexual gratification from other, actual teenagers, who with your superior life experience are laughably easy to manipulate into giving you that gratification. 

Then, finally, after an entire fake childhood of living a lie and probably becoming an amoral piece of shit, you're finally in a position to start cashing in on your future knowledge (which by now is foggy and 15 years old) and start reaping gains from bitcoin and Tesla. Now you are a 22-year-old multimillionaire with the mind of a 40-year-old, wealthy but completely alone in the world because anyone who spends enough time around you can sense the terrible *wrongness* lurking behind your youthful exterior.

applextrent,"Right there with you.

People don’t understand what’s coming. 

The supply chain is fucked. I was finally able to get my hands on more guns and ammo again, but food costs are insane, my rent keeps increasing, theres no rentals available in my area, I’ve never seen so many homes for sale in my area, but yet the price of homes is increasing despite a massive spike in supply. Homes are selling kind of, but to who I have no idea. Some of them seem to be sitting empty after being bought and they’re not being rented out. It makes no sense. 

Meanwhile I still can’t find all-terrain tires for my Jeep due to nation wide supply shortages.

The housing market is about to crash while we’re about to hit hyper inflation, so both the value of property could drop but the dollar could weaken just as much if not more so home prices might actually increase despite the market crashing. It’s going to be weird. Buy Bitcoin I guess?

Meanwhile the vaccinated are starting to realize they’ve been had. The boomers seem to be losing their minds from the vaccines. I swear most of the boomers I know who are vaccinated aged considerably in the past few months post vaccines, and several of them are showing dementia like signs when previously they were fine. Several of my Dad’s friends have had to have pace makers installed post vaccination. Many of the younger people I know are having vaccine regret now and they’re finally starting to wake up.

It turns out many people who said “the side effects are just the vaccine working” are still having said side effects indefinitely and now they’re starting to get “breakthrough” cases and they’re slowly starting to realize they’ve been had. Both in the sense that the vaccines don’t work, cause more harm than good, and that Covid is not as big as a deal as they said it was.

More and more people are coming to terms with the fact that Biden has dementia, and probably didn’t win the election. Everyone universally seems to agree that Kamala Harris is awful.

There’s basically a Cold War brewing with China and Russia, and possibly even a civil war.

I agree I just want to get it over with, but on the other hand I’m enjoying the calm before the storm because shit is about to get real.",h4fl6ij,2021-07-08 12:05:08,68

LQ_Weevil,"Am I understanding this correctly?
  
- buy our fake money with real money
- create a fake synthetic asset with that fake money at the value of the real asset in the real world.
- speculate with the fake asset.
- get any gains back in fake money
- where did the real money go? I CAN'T HEAR YOU OVER THE ENGINES OF MY NEW LEARJET!

There is literally no reason given to not buy, say, the real $AAPL with real money, and realise gains (or losses) in real money.

I based the above on the following from the article.

""Using Synthetix or Mirror to trade stocks like $AAPL $TSLA $TWTR $AMZN is easier than you might imagine. The way it works is simple.

Users mint (create) synthetic assets by depositing collateral (SNX for Synthetix, UST for Mirror). The collateral is used to back the minted synthetic asset with real value.

Oracles feed the target asset’s price to the platform in real-time, enabling the synthetic to track value accurately.

Traders use Synthetix or Mirror to trade assets like mBTC (mirrored Bitcoin), sUSD (synthetic USD), or popular equities like mGME (mirrored Gamestop).

Minters retain a reward for minting and creating liquidity for exchange-traded assets paid in the protocol's native asset (SNX or MIR).""",h4gqh4x,2021-07-08 21:05:38,73

There has been a massive effort recently to plant the seeds in the public's mind about cyber attacks causing issues with supply chains and the power grid also having issues. This has been ramping up. Someone wants the public to know about cyber attacks so that they remain calm when everything goes down and assume oh its just another cyber attack like the others so everything will be back online in a few days so no need to riot. Cyber Polygon is tomorrow. There were similar training exercises right before several other black swan events, covid included.

The everything bubble is at bursting point but they need something to blame that crash on, such as a cyber attack taking out power/internet for just long enough to blame. If it happens to make bitcoin look bad then that helps too because if people invest in bitcoin then that takes away power from the dollar. Expect these fake cyber attacks to involve a demand in bitcoin, which is something that no hacker would ever demand because most hackers typically mine crypto currency on the side and know it is traceable.

dzScritches,"You're lucky you get such a harsh comedown. I never got anything; when I'd run out, I just slowly got less stimulated until I passed out, then I slept for 18 hours. Next day was fine.

When I started using meth I'd heard that the comedowns were hell and I was counting on that to keep me from getting stuck on it. That didn't happen, so I'd buy two grams from the darknet, use it for two weeks, then crash; wake up a couple days later, buy more on impulse, wait for it to arrive, and repeat.

I did this for 9 months until, on the tail end of an 8 day binge, I took an unknown quantity of LSD - which showed me, rather violently, what I was doing to my life. I woke up from the worse trip nightmare I'd ever had and immediately flushed the meth, broke my pipes, ran water through the baggies, destroyed it all. The next day I closed my market accounts, deleted my bitcoin wallets, and burned my bitcoin exchange accounts.

Haven't touched it since. It's been 6 years I think? I've lost track.

Zyreal,"Honestly the joke tweet I put in my other comment isn't far off

&gt; Imagine if keeping your car idling 24/7 produced solved Sudokus you could trade for heroin

To truly ""Get it"" requires a lot more than I can explain in a reddit comment, so all of this is simplifying to some degree, but I'll give the next step up from that comment.

Effectively you use your computer, usually the Graphics Processing Unit(because it is more optimized for the type of calculations/throughput needed with this) to verify sections of the Bitcoin blockchain. 

The Bitcoin blockchain is basically a massive linked collection of all records of Bitcoin transactions, which have a hash(unique fingerprint kinda) of the previous record.

In return for running this verification, you are given a tiny tiny tiny fraction of 1 BTC. Which is what people mean by ""mining""

There is complicated math behind the fact that as more Bitcoin is ""mined"" you get less and less for each verification.

And once you get Bitcoin, there is a whole grey/black market for exchanging BTC for other currencies, storing, etc.

This is a huge oversimplification of Bitcoin, and almost everything I just said can be ""Well actually'd"". So...

TL;DR-

So she got mad and essentially called them thieves and said they were just leeching off of her work. FitGirl and a bunch of repackers didn’t appreciate that, so they made a statement saying they will never repack another game of hers again. And they said that they aren’t stealing anything from her especially money because they leave her requests for donations message in tact (EMPRESS has a message in her cracks where she asks for donations and gives you a Bitcoin address so you can donate money to her the first time you launch the game)

It actually started so much drama that even crackwatch intervened and had a vote as to whether she was crossing the line (because on top of all that EMPRESS was also doing philosophy posts on crackwatch that people didn’t like and apparently she offended some people because of one of those posts). Anyways they voted that she could only post her nfo’s from now on.

EMPRESS apologized to everyone in a post, especially FitGirl, and acknowledged that crackwatch wasn’t the right place for her philosophy posts (thus her own subreddit was created).

Your premise is flawed. You treat this like a get rich scheme. I've been in crypto for over a decade. This is what these do. They have these remarkable Bulls and Bubbles then they pop and settle down. They normally settle down to higher when they started their Bull Run. Couple years later, they boom and increase in price again. It is what has been the cycle, bitcoin has done it 4-5 times already. You just came late this round. Pay your dues and wait it out like everybody else. Right now, the getting is good right now on RVN. Look at how much you can mine.Eventually you will not be able to mine like this. Fill your bag up during the Bear and when the Bull comes back make a profit if you want.   


I remember mining bitcoin in 2014/2015 and it had a huge spike and then came crashing down. I was making 1 bitcoin every couple of days. My house was hot, my electric bill was about $600-$800 a month. I was paying for electricity out of pocket. I admit, I had to stop, I even tried to sell my miners. But it was a bear market and nobody wanted to buy my miners. So I delisted them and waited for awhile. I eventually decided I could pay an extra $200 a month in electric. Then I mined and I mined, and I eventually was able to bring the other miners back on line. I would forget about my miners. Became just another thing I would have to check on every once in awhile to bring it back online or whatever. Days became weeks, became months, became years. Then 2018 hit, and Bitcoin went up to $20,000 each. I was handsomely reward for staying the course. I retired and I just study science and Physics now. I do what I want.

Give it some time, things will happen on RVN coin. Specially because Ethereum is effectively slicing GPU miners out of the network. That will push miners to look for the most profitable coin, and that will more than likely be RVN. EIP-1559 will make Ethereum and RVN pretty equal in monthly profits with bitcoin at 5 cents. If it ticks up even one penny it will be more profitable than Ethereum to mine. This will increase interest and use, will create a loud buzz and then the halving comes in January.   


Stop Mining or Keep Mining, either way I'll be here mining and getting a Kawzillion RVN. Right now it is 0.05 cents each. If it goes to 10 cents a coin, then right now, I am making more mining RAVEN today than ethereum. I'm very long on RVN Coin. I just make it and forget about it. Time will age it like a fine wine. That has been my experience. Not financial advice or whatever, I'm a moron, I only know math and physics. Don't listen to me about money. I eat paste.",h4pt2zv,2021-07-11 01:35:01,61

Most people just use their credit cards to pay for everything. And when they swipe their card and see “transaction approved” within a few seconds, they think that means the transaction is settled.

Most people don’t realize how complicated major payment settlement networks are, how many layers are involved going from credit card company to the central bank, and how long it actually takes to settle payments using the legacy system.

Given that, most people don’t realize how valuable a payment network like Bitcoin really is. They don’t realize how valuable it is to be able to send money to anyone in the world, and have that transaction completely settle within hours if not minutes, regardless of the size of the transaction, and without exorbitant and largely unnecessary fees.

MDCCCLV,"""	Conventional wisdom has it that the lower a central bank sets interest rates, the faster the economy grows. But the longer rates stay ultra-low, it’s not the economy that grows — it’s inequality. 
	There are signs of worsening inequality across the U.S. economy. But recent surges trace back to a major change after 2008, which transformed how America fights economic recessions. 

Source: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

	The Fed, which controls America’s monetary policy, is mired in conventional thinking, even though its policy since 2008 has been unconventional in scale, scope and omnipotence. Adhering to its “lower rates are better” axiom, the Fed has kept “real” U.S. short-term interest rates at — or even below — zero, after taking inflation into account. The Fed now plans to keep rates ultra, ultra low until about 2023, even if inflation ticks up. 
	This results in even wider wealth inequalities as the gap between rich and everyone else grows. 
	Is the stunning growth in U.S. inequality all the Fed’s fault? Of course not. Tax policy has favored the wealthy and corporations for decades, to name one other cause. But income and wealth inequality result from who gets the money. And the Fed has unrivaled power over who gets the money across markets, communities and even families. 

	The Fed controls the flow of money, and it flows to the wealthy 

	The Fed’s main tools for fighting recessions are twofold: those ultra-low interest rates and a policy known as quantitative easing, or Q.E. Q.E is what happens when the Fed buys up assets, like bonds, which keeps money flowing and gives banks lots of liquidity that is supposed to make lending easier. 
	To get an idea of the magnitude of the Fed’s role, take a look at its portfolio. Assets the Fed has taken out of the economy as part of Q.E. now stand at $8.1 trillion, or about one-third of gross domestic product. 

A growing portfolio

To stimulate the economy after 2008, the Federal Reserve increased its balance sheet and slashed interest rates. The current coronavirus pandemic sent that strategy into overdrive, creating the largest balance sheet on record and the lowest interest rates in modern U.S. history.

Source: FRED 

	No one else could own that much, meaning no one but the Fed has so much power over the economy’s winners and losers. 
	The Fed’s approach is premised on trickle-down expectations, adopted in the early 2000s. U.S. central bankers believe the higher that markets fly and the more that the wealthy spend, the better that everyone else will be. 
	In truth, this policy works only for the wealthy. 
	Although the Fed’s huge Q.E.-based portfolio initially prevented still worse economic mayhem when the 2008 and 2020 financial crises struck, its benefits over time were 10 times greater for stock-market prices than for overall economic prosperity. 

Who’s helped by stimulus?

Using a model, researchers estimated the impact of an increase in quantitative easing on the economy. They found stocks saw 10 times the growth of G.D.P.

Source: Bank for International Settlements 

	Ultra-low interest rates are meant to spur growth. But they stop having a beneficial effect when they dip so low that they distort savings incentives and instead drive speculative investing, like in Bitcoin or GameStop, to cite two current examples. 

	Savings, home values and stocks are up — but these also favor the rich 

	Many Americans own stock, but most stocks – 54 percent – are owned by the 1 percent and much of the rest by the next 9 percent. 
	The same can be said of real estate. Low interest rates set by the Fed spur lending, creating more demand to purchase homes and forcing prices higher. Rising equity is great for existing homeowners, but richer Americans who own property are the ones who benefit most. 

Source: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (wealth and equities); Zillow (home value index); Capital I.Q. (stock price). 

	What about Americans who are trying to get ahead not through assets, but through saving? Even low-income households are doing their best to save a surprising amount of money. But the Fed’s interest-rate policy robs savers of any interest they might see. 
	The inequality impact of the invest-you-gain, save-you-lose conundrum is clear. To understand why, imagine two people trying to grow $10,000 through investing or saving. 

Low rates hurt savers

The Fed’s low interest rate environment causes stocks to surge, but everyday savers struggle to keep up with inflation.

	The calculations above show that even if average Americans could save $10,000, they would be falling far behind investors. After inflation, their thrift would net only $9,529 – a flat-out loss. 

	What is the Fed for? 

	The Fed’s role is spelled out under its statutory charter, which establishes the road map for unraveling the inequality it helped create. 
	The charter’s first goal is “full employment,” meaning pretty much everyone who wants a job has one. This would get a meaningful, immediate boost if the Fed reversed its cheap-debt policies that lead companies to take out debt to fund investor profits, instead of funding new plants or products. 
	Another goal is “price stability,” best measured by what it costs for a middle-class household to make ends meet. The measure the Fed uses misses the cost increases obscuring a household-to-debt build-up for all but the wealthiest. The Fed thus misses the long-term risks this debt poses to financial security, home ownership, and a secure retirement. 
	The law has a third Fed goal: “moderate” interest rates. Rates below zero after taking inflation into account are anything but moderate, so they must be gradually raised, starting now. 
	The current recovery is being driven not by the Fed but by the stimulus bills passed by Congress. After that spending fades, we will be a nation in which at least a quarter of middle-class households still can’t even afford the medical treatment they require, lower-income millennials have student debt equal to at least 372 percent of income, and still more won’t be able to handle even a $400 unexpected expense. 
	This is wealth without prosperity, a violation of every tenet in the Fed’s statutory mandate. Instead of regretting inequality even as it makes inequality worse, the Fed can and must quickly rewrite policy with a new goal in mind: shared prosperity, measured by how most of us do, not by how high the market flies.

Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord. In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim’s account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer’s wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer’s wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.

sahildeONE,"you're absolutely right. There's a lot of new blockchains, protocols, dapps and it's yet to be seen which ones succeed on the basis of clear utility or adoption. I think this is an outcome of where we are in the technology cycle for blockchain. In 2018, when Harmony started, the most difficult and crucial problem to solve was scalability. Over the next two years, we saw several scalability solutions coming live.  But going live doesn't mean much if we don't attract developers, applications and users.  


Harmony has a scalable architecture due to sharding. So we're not concerned about scalability anymore, or as much. Rather, we're heavily focussed on a)bringing existing blockchain developers (from Ethereum) to deploy applications without any friction. b) Connecting with other important and growing blockchains through Bridges. c) Ensuring secure and on-chain wallets with seamless UX to bring the next 100M users.  


We've been working hard on each of the above initiatives. We have full Ethereum compatibility, it takes a few minutes to deploy Ethereum apps on Harmony, eg: Sushiswap was deployed 7 days ago and already has great traction. We have bridged with Ethereum, BSC, Terra and coming up with Bitcoin, Polkadot bridges. We're believe in a multi-chain world and therefore we're building the pipes and tunnels to make the future Dapps frictionless for end-users. Finally, you'll see some more developments on the keyless, on-chain wallet primitives.

We are working towards open-development and open-governance, which will be the backbone of our growing ecosystem. 

Each blockchain has their own strengths and approaches, but the above is what we believe in and are confident that this will be our long-term differentiator.",h52jg31,2021-07-14 04:18:52,64

&gt;**TYLER NIKNAM WAS** getting out of Texas. Niknam, 30, is a top streamer on Twitch, where he’s better known as Trainwrecks to his 1.5 million followers. For hours on end, Niknam was hitting the slots on Stake.com, an online cryptocurrency casino and his most prominent Twitch sponsor, to live audiences of 25,000. He’d been winning big, sometimes as much as $400,000 in crypto in one fell swoop, and he never seemed to go broke. The problem? It wasn’t allowed.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you visit Stake on a US-based browser, a message will quickly pop up on the site: “Due to our gaming license, we cannot accept players from the United States.” Though Stake doesn't possess a gambling license in any state, Nikam and other US gamblers easily circumvent this by using VPNs. Promoting gambling sites that cannot operate in the US and making money by referring US residents to them may constitute promoting illegal gambling, legal experts told WIRED.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Canada needs to happen asap,” Niknam wrote in a private Discord DM to Felix “xQc” Lengyel, 25, Twitch’s number-two streamer. Lengyel briefly streamed slots but stopped in June. “You cannot show you’re on Stake at all.” A few days later, Niknam arrived in Canada, where he settled into a routine gambling in a mostly empty apartment, sometimes for over a dozen hours a day. (Niknam did not respond to WIRED’s requests for comment.)  
&gt;  
&gt;Twitch is in the middle of a gambling boom, fueled by the rise of so-called “crypto casinos”: websites where gamblers can purchase cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum for use in digital games of chance like slots, blackjack, and baccarat. Sites like Stake and Roobet are paying popular streamers to play the casino games on their channels, sometimes offering tens of thousands of dollars an hour according to streamers and experts interviewed by WIRED. One gambling website, Duelbits, apparently offered top gambling streamer, Adin Ross, between $1.4 and $1.6 million a month to stream slots on Twitch, according to a Discord DM between himself and Duelbits. (Ross, who was recently suspended from Twitch for using his phone while driving, did not respond to WIRED’s requests for comment. Neither did Stake, Roobet, or Duelbits.)  
&gt;  
&gt;A WIRED review found that 64 of the top 1,000 most-trafficked Twitch streamers have streamed crypto slots or advertised sponsorship deals from crypto gambling websites, although the trend gained real traction in April and May of 2021. Some streams attract over 100,000 live viewers. Many of these streamers are members of Twitch’s Partner Program, which gives top creators access to additional support and features like increased revenue sharing. It’s Twitch’s highest tier of streamers, and the company says it looks for people “who can act as role models to the community”—a community where 21 percent of users are between 13 and 17 years old.  
&gt;  
&gt;One thing it might not be good to take these role models’ advice on? The perils of losing money gambling. Some streamers may be playing with house money. Keeping up the appearance of painless fun, crypto casinos sponsoring these streamers refresh their digital wallets with money, according to videos, leaked chats, and interviews with individuals knowledgeable about crypto gambling on Twitch.  
&gt;  
&gt;“It wasn’t my money,” Matthew “Mizkif” Rinaudo said on his Twitch channel in June. Rinaudo, 26, says he was getting offers to do gambling streams for $35,000 an hour—double the price tag of his typical sponsorships—for 10 hour-long streams over the course of a month. (One individual who works with multiple Twitch streamers says that tens of thousands of dollars per hour is normal for these streams.) He had streamed gambling earlier this year, just five times in April, and says sponsors were fleshing out his crypto casino account, once with $5,000. Plus, he’d advertise affiliate links with attractive discounts. Despite the lucrative business opportunity, Rinaudo decided to stop working with online crypto casinos in June.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Morality came into play. It did. I felt shitty doing any type of gambling sponsorship,” he later said on stream. “And I know people are like, Mizkif, but you do sponsors all fucking day. If you download Dungeons and Dragons, what’s the worst that happens? You lose $40 and a couple of hours of your life. Gambling is different.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Online gambling is regulated by a combination of federal and state laws in the US. Gambling websites need a license to operate in individual states—doesn’t matter whether they’re operating with hard USD or digital currency. Many crypto casinos, like Stake and Duelbits, are based offshore in countries like Curaçao, and do not have those licenses. Yet they are easy to access from the US through a VPN. (More reputable online gambling sites ask users for more data points to confirm their location.) “While \[these sites\] block the US, they do not prevent access from people within the US,” says Jeff Ifrah, an attorney who specializes in online gambling law. Ifrah says he recently has been fielding lots of questions from US-based Twitch streamers and their representatives. While legal experts say it can be tough to prosecute these websites, their US-based promoters may be open to scrutiny.  
&gt;  
&gt;Taking sponsorships from and encouraging illegal gambling can land streamers in sticky legal territory, Ifrah says. He warns streamers against advertising these crypto gambling sites while streaming from the US. “My advice to them is that, basically, the underlying activity is illegal.” It still happens, though. “There’s a lot of money in it,” he says. “Streamers have told me, ‘Hey, I don't want to just give this up. This is a big opportunity for me because these sites pay a lot of money.’”  
&gt;  
&gt;There may be big opportunities, but they can come with big risks. “A lot of the gambling promoted on Twitch is illegal or unregulated and poses definite risks for consumers, vulnerable adults and adolescents or underage children,” says Keith Whyte, the executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling, an organization that promotes comprehensive policies to support healthy, legal gambling. Because these sites often aren’t as vetted as sites that are legal in the US, experts question whether their odds are fair and what their backends look like, says Whyte. “It’s a fairly common tactic in the unregulated gambling industry to inflate win rates.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Gambling experts interviewed by WIRED say that right now, it’s on Twitch to act. “The health of their users is something to be concerned about,” says Whyte. “They have enormous incentive to police content that is either illegal, unregulated or potentially harmful.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Twitch’s terms of service prohibit illegal activity on its website and ask users to comply with the Federal Trade Commission’s guidelines around advertising. With that said, it does not specifically ban gambling streams. Crypto gambling is flourishing on Twitch, frankly, because it is allowed to. By contrast, livestreaming competitors YouTube and Facebook Gaming prohibit streaming online gambling sites that have not been previously reviewed. Twitch also has gambling-related categories, such as slots, which have no age limit to prevent younger viewers from watching (some stream titles say “18+”).  
&gt;  
&gt;Twitch tells WIRED, “We strictly prohibit illegal content and activity on the service, and take action in all verified incidents of illegal gambling that are reported to us. Our Community Guidelines make clear that ‘\[Streamers\] must respect all applicable local, national, and international laws while using our services. Any content or activity featuring, encouraging, offering, or soliciting illegal activity is prohibited.’” The company adds that its goal is to foster “a safe, positive experience for all users of our service” and that it is “closely monitoring gambling content.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Twitch has had to deal with gambling-related controversies on its platform before. Years ago, top streamers gambled with cosmetics from the first-person shooter Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Skins gambling was an unregulated frontier that soon became massively popular—and filled with allegations of foul play. The first Twitch streamer to reach one million, and later two million, followers was Tom “Syndicate” Cassell. Cassell drew in huge audiences gambling and winning big on the site CSGOLotto.com, but he also reached a settlement with the FTC in late 2017 for failing to disclose his status as vice president of CSGOLotto.com while promoting it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Streamer Moe ""m0E"" Assad, who was sponsored by skin gambling site CSGO Diamonds, played with house money without disclosing it to viewers. CSGODiamonds also later admitted that it told Assad the outcome of games in advance so he could fix the results. Gaming celebrity Richard “FaZe Banks” Bengston, co-owner of esports team FaZe Clan, recently said he made $200,000 a day running his own skin-gambling site, which was incorporated on the Caribbean island of Antigua. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive publisher Valve cracked down on skin gambling sites, in 2016 sending cease-and-desist notices to 20 websites.

&gt;Prominent figures from the skins gambling scene are now getting involved in crypto casinos. Assad has been gambling on Twitch since last year; now that gambling has blown up on Twitch, he is making bank with his Roobet sponsorship between games of the first-person shooter Valorant. Bengston, 29, is also sponsored by Roobet. A native on YouTube, Bengston made his Twitch debut early last month alongside crypto gambling streamer Adin Ross. He played slots on Roobet, and spoke highly of his sponsor: “They treat us so well, fly us out to Mexico for these things. Full compliance, by the fucking books baby.” (Speaking on Bengston’s behalf, FaZe Clan declined to comment.)On his stream, from Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, Bengston’s account starts with $15,000 in Bitcoin. He’s playing “Mines” (think Minesweeper, but with cryptocurrency stakes). 40,000 people are watching. His first bet is $2,000. He blows through the $15,000 in 40 seconds. “I need to ask them for more bread,” says Bengston. “We’re gonna pretend that just didn’t happen.” In his next round, $7,000 becomes $0 immediately. Dismissing Mines, Bengston switches to Slots. There’s $15,000 in his account. The Roobet window is not on screen between when he loses all his money and money enters the account. At the end of the stream, he is up $203,000. He gives thousands in Roobet funds to his viewers.

SwagtimusPrime,"Despite the price action, I can't help but feel more bullish than ever.

Uni v3 just went live on Optimism. Which means the full Optimism launch isn't far off - with countless more dapps available. If BSC is any indication, we'll get a shit load of speculative new dapps. Most of them trash, but it's the activity and liquidity that counts - and in the end, it all settles on L1 and pays gas to Ethereum.

Then we have Arbitrum which will release in the same time frame, with its own share of dapps. Looking forward to Bancor on Arbitrum.

These two will be in fierce competition as they will be the only two general purpose rollups in town. Competition is perfect as they'll be looking to incentivize people to use their rollup.

Next, we have EIP-1559 launching on Aug 4th, forever burning a big part of the gas fees and thus forever accruing value to ETH. Yes, gas fees are low right now, but I expect them to take off again as soon as rollups take over the entire DeFi and NFT markets. Once everyone is on L2, nobody cares about high L1 fees anymore - the high fees narrative will die and it will instead be encouraged as it accrues value to ETH holders.

Beyond all this, it looks like a Bitcoin ETF is in the cards for later this year, which of course implies that an ETH ETF will not be far off, likely in 2022.

And of course, we get the merge either late 2021 or early 2022, which has incredible impact on the supply side of Ethereum - the Cliffening. 

I'm a firm believer that, if we take all of this into account, the bear will be a small one, as the supply of ETH is getting scarce as hell in early 2022. Two to three times the impact of a Bitcoin halving.

There's a real possibility that ETH will rise from the ashes of the bear in Q2 2022 and flips Bitcoin in the process. In the end, it's just logical. If ETH has been outperforming BTC for extended periods of time despite having much higher inflation, and we reduce that inflation to be significantly below Bitcoin's,

then ETH becomes a higher risk higher return asset that basically eliminates the ""higher risk"" part and just becomes the better returns asset.

Call this hopium, but I sincerely belive this is how it's gonna play out.

Just take a look at crypto twitter, projects releasing new versions of their protocols left and right, building DAOs, governance systems, collaborations, NFTs imbuing the entire space, teams for the first time deploying on rollups and experiencing instant settlement and low fees.

To anyone glued to the charts in worry and fear, I say: it doesn't matter. At all. ETH is in a period of rapid transformation and change. Come back 1-2 years from now and I think it will surpass all of our expectations.

Time in the market beats timing the market. While we wait for the markets to grok what we grok, use your ETH and other assets to generate passive income, or stake your ETH if your tax jurisdiction isn't shit, and stack gwei.

The reality is that Bitcoin mining does require a shit ton of power. Most of it is not from renewables, and when it is from renewables, we must also consider whether that energy is diverting renewable energy from a community and forcing that community to use more fossil fuels.

Pyroyoma,"Can we all take a second to APPRECIATE that we are witnessing a very rare and special talent that is bursting onto the scene right now. The golden-baked, crispy nuggets we have heard from STUCA in the past 3 months have been on a level FAR and BEYOND the normal confines of our trap reality. The fact that this man only has 3.5K SC followers is honestly CRIMINAL, and the trapheads of the world should not STAND for this utter lack of awareness. Like a lot of us, I've only become woke to this gift to the world in the last 3 weeks thanks to Santa ""Awakening"" Ekali-aus. AAAND AAALLLREADY I want this man STUCA touring in my state, my city, and in my bed. Promoters everywhere should realize this man is set for launch off of a hype rocket that can only be paralleled by 2017 BITCOIN.
Nghtmre....you're the one with the big tour right now. Please do the people a favor, and bless their ears with his sound waves. When you come through the U.S. soon, just fill the rest of your set that is not your's and Slander's music with STUCA songs. The only thing that can go wrong is that you wish you produced less songs so that you could have filled more of your set with STUCA songs.

MoBitcoinMoProblems,"I can give you my personal experience on this. I cashed out about $5 million a few months ago. I didn't use OTC, just a regular reputable exchange, where I made a bunch of limit orders and waiting for them to be hit, a checking account at a large bank where I wired the proceeds, and a brokerage account where the proceeds ended up.

I could have figured out if my costs basis was $0.40 or $1.50 for each bitcoin sold, but I just didn't bother. I've reported and will continue to report all ancient bitcoin as having a cost basis of zero. The IRS doesn't seem to mind.

I did contact my bank a few years prior to get a read on whether they would give me a hard time for shuffling a few million dollars through them, and whether funds coming from bitcoin proceeds would be an issue with them. While they stopped well short from giving me any guarantees, they indicated they had no fundamental issue with any of it, and as it turned out, they didn't mind when I actually did it.

It's probably a good idea track all the addresses you've used on a spreadsheet, walk back each of your transactions on the blockchain, figure out which addresses were yours, which weren't, and what each transaction from the latter to the former meant exactly. It's useful when an exchange asks you questions, it's useful when you prepare your taxes, and it would be useful if the IRS ever decided to audit you. My CPA has seen my little spreadsheet with those details, but so far nobody else has needed to. 

A couple of months after selling, my exchange contacted me to ask me for paper documentation on the origin of my coins. Alas Slush's pool wasn't really into paperwork back then, and even if they were, they would have had no idea who I was. So I handwaved that as best as I could, using a few details from my little spreadsheet, and somehow it has been enough to satisfy the exchange. YMMV.

This is a simple, and perhaps naive approach. There are other ways to go about this. For example, /u/nullc wrote about [a more sophisticated approach to cashing out](/r/fatFIRE/comments/lz2kzs/how_to_sell_bitcoin_in_the_usa/gq1zrfj/?context=3), which involves options.

The last piece I'd mention is that you're going to be on the hook for 25% of your profits as federal taxes, plus whatever your state wants on top of it. If you're interested in charitable giving, it could be a good time to look into Donor Advised Funds, and the ability to deposit appreciated assets into them as a way to both get a large tax deduction upfront and maximize your donated value. The DAF will typically sell the bitcoins you deposit right away, after which you'll be able to (direct the DAF to) invest them into conventional instruments as you see fit. Oh, and start thinking about quarterly estimated taxes, they might start becoming suddenly relevant to you. Do you have a CPA? You probably should have a CPA.",h581mqo,2021-07-15 10:24:49,67

MentalUsurpation,"**1. Ethereum ETFs are here.**

Exchange-Traded Funds for Ethereum are finally here and will gain popularity really quickly. First Canada, and now Brazil, have approved ETH ETFs. At the same time, multiple ETH ETF applications are waiting in line at the SEC in the USA which, once approved, will result in major money pouring into Ethereum.

**2. Ethereum takes the throne for innovation.**

There is no doubt. When it comes to innovating, Ethereum is king. It has the biggest developmental lead, and its recent releases of multiple layer two features really stresses this. Uniswap, which is the biggest DEX on ETH, has just announced its integration of Optimism for scaling.

**3. The triple halving is on its way.**

As of now, ETH annual inflation is around 4.5%. When ETH upgrades to 2.0, it will drop to around 0.5% only. This equals 3 Bitcoin halvings! This is surely a bullish sign.

**4. EIP 1559 to be implemented next month.**

The London Hard Fork EIP 1559 will burn the fees paid for some transactions. This will eventually turn ETH into a deflationary currency.

**5. Proof-of-Stake coming VERY SOON.**

The most-awaited update might just make its way here this year. The shift to PoS will change the economics of ETH from a mine-and-dump economy to a stake-and-hodl economy.  One of its most important contributions will be removing the environmental impact critique.

**6. Demand for Ethereum is promising.**

For one, the amount of ETH locked in the 2.0 staking contract continues to grow. In fact, more than 6.2 million ETH is locked in 2.0. Along with this, on-exchange supplies keep hitting new lows.

**7. Ethereum is overtaking Bitcoin on most important metrics.**

For instance, Ethereum is settling 3X more than Bitcoin every day on-chain. Other than that, Ethereum is also recording higher fee earnings than Bitcoin. Moreso, while Bitcoin may be the future of money, Ethereum is seen as the future of technology. That sort of thinking globally, might lead to a shift in preference between the top two coins.",h5n3mkj,2021-07-19 00:41:11,93

Text moves too fast to read.  The changing of the font sizes is confusing and hard to read.

The flashing makes it uncomfortable - you want people to ENJOY watching an ad, not worry they're going to have a seizure.

Starting the ad with the text ""Bitcoin"", then ""Ethereum"", makes the first impression feel that it's a Bitcoin or Ethereum ad.  If this was \*really\* an ad, most people would have switched off before you got to anything about Nano - you would have promoted two competitors instead of Nano.

Also, by comparing it to two other cryptocurrencies, rather than something in it's own right, you're only really going to be understood by \*existing\* crypto-nerds.  Surely that's not what we want, right?  It'd be better for an ad to resonate with people who \*aren't\* currently crypto-fans.

You need to work out how to communicate / demonstrate what makes Nano special, without comparing it to other cryptos, and using language your mum would understand.

What do you actually want people to do after watching this?  There's no ""call to action""... a good ad should call on people to DO something.

You eventually start to expect everyone to treat you like that, from the classic teen girl or boy, to 40 year olds that you perceive as being your peers, or even lesser than you because they have no bitcoin. 

So yeah, ego and being rich is a great combo for being blindly self assured and entitled",h5txrkf,2021-07-20 11:49:38,89

DYTTIGAF,"Warren Buffet has been living off government largesse for about 40 years.

He used the purchase of GEICO (Government Employee Insurance Company) as a piggy bank for risk free cash to fund over 40 acquisitions.  He really doesn't like technology and his has admitted as much over the decades.

The only reason he purchased Apple stock over the last few years was not because he liked the company..it was the massive buybacks the board at Apple decided to embark on (with cheap money from the Federal Reserve).

Warren is a simple man. Read his past 30 Chairman's letters which he writes each year for his shareholders.  They are online. Just fucking brilliant.

You will get an education how to sandblast away all the hubris you hear everyday from all the financial news shows (and get a chance to see how the richest man in the investing world thinks). Just amazing.

sollichodernicht,"Nach fast einem Jahr habe ich mich dann doch nochmal dazu bequemt das CJ Wörterbuch zu updaten. RBTV ist so irrelevant geworden, dass es die Arbeit eigentlich gar nicht verdient, aber das CJ verdient es dann schon irgendwie. Außerdem müssen die ganzen Neujerker ja auch wissen, was hier abgeht. Dafür ist das CJ-Wörterbuch ja da.
In diesem Update habe ich 15 Memes hinzugefügt. Manche sind recht neu, andere sind schon fast uralt, aber halt noch nicht drin gewesen. Damit kommen wir nun vorerst auf 107 Memes im Wörterbuch. Weitere sollen bald folgen. 
Ihr könnt in diesem Thread wieder gerne neue Vorschläge machen. Alternativ (und ich würde es eigentlich bevorzugen) gibt es im CJ-Discord dafür den Channel #wörterbuch.

Liste der neuen Memes (Juli 2021):

* 1000-Jahre-Bann
* 150h
* Ansonsten: Verleumdung.
* Bitcoin-Kurs
* Du bist ein Nichts
* Fänds mega, wenn Du diesen Seitenhieb einfach löschen könntest.
* Gewerke
* Hier ist zum Glück nicht Reddit.
* Item
* Jeansjacke und Hut
* Krisselig
* lol. Das war keine Review.
* Roundabout
* Schöööön auf Malle
* Top (/Mega)

Und hier noch die, die in (naher) Zukunft folgen werden:

* (aus der Community)
* 8-Seiten-Regeln
* Budibot
* CJ Awards
* Circle Jörg
* Das Tragen einer Kopfbedeckung in geschlossenen Räumen entspricht nicht dem westlichen sozialen Standard.
* Lebkuchen
* Peinlicher Ex-Mitarbeiter
* USB-Stick

Actnaou,"Good post op. Im adding also some potentially educational info from one of my previous posts. 

1 Everyone’s a genius in a bull market. Real traders can survive and even thrive in bear markets or highly volatile markets.  
  
2 - Don’t be a blind bull. ALL markets are cyclical. Don’t be afraid of pullbacks or market crashes – that’s where you can make the most money.  
  
3 - There’s a big difference between a trade and an investment.  
  
4 - Fully plan your trade before you pull the trigger on the entry.  
  
5 - Entries are important, but risk &amp; money management is where you make or lose money.  
  
6 - Beware of get-rich-quick gurus hopping on the crypto bandwagon over the past year.  
  
7 - Decide which types of trade setups or investments you’ll take and ignore everything else.  
  
8 - Don’t assume just because you’ve made a lot of money in crypto that you can just as easily make money in other financial markets. 95%+ of stock market traders LOSE money. The game is rigged. Stick to what you know works for you.  
  
9 - The best way to day trade cryptocurrencies is – DON’T!  
  
10 - The best way to profit in any market is to find something you think has big potential early (before the general public catches on), and invest assuming you’re going to lose 100% of your capital. It’s the “angel investor” approach.  
  
11 - You can’t control the market. The only thing you can control is your entries, trade size, and exits.  
  
12 - One market participant can completely destroy “good technical analysis”.  
  
13 - Don’t blindly follow trade alerts from ANYONE, especially random people on social media or chat rooms.  
  
14 - All financial networking marketing projects are ponzi schemes, period.  
  
15 - If you make a life-changing amount of money, do NOTHING for at least 30 days.  
  
16 - Trading isn’t about picking exact tops and bottoms in a market – it’s about catching the meat of a move.  
  
17 - Don’t turn a small losing trade into a massive losing investment.  
  
18 - Don’t set daily profit target goals – set long-term performance goals.  
  
19 - Learn to survive, then thrive.  
  
20 - The best charting indicators are price action and volume. You can use others, but it won’t necessarily make you a more profitable trader.  
  
21 - Trends can go way past what seems rational.  
  
22 - Don’t try to pick tops in a market. Wait for the market to tell you when the trend is over.  
  
23 - Don’t trade in front of big news events – it’s impossible to predict how markets will react.  
  
24 - The biggest challenge for most traders is their ego, or the need to be right.  
  
25 - You can lose 50% of your trades and still be profitable if you manage risk properly.  
  
26 - The best entrepreneurs and CEO’s typically make the worst traders and investors.  
  
27 - People with the best mindset for investing typically have a career in high-risk situations like firefighters, pilots, police.  
  
28 - Avoid pump and dump groups like the plague they are.  
  
29 - You WILL make every mistake in the book. Don’t beat yourself up when you make mistakes, just learn and try not to make the same mistake twice.  
  
30 - Don’t treat crypto exchanges like bank accounts. You don’t own the coins unless you control the private keys.  
  
31 - Crypto is a 24/7/365 market. You can’t catch every trade. If you miss one, don’t worry – there’s ALWAYS another trade.  
  
32 - Don’t invest in a coin unless you understand it inside out.  
  
33 - You can make money trading the momentum and hype in shitcoins, just don’t invest long-term.  
  
34 - Stay away from coins with low trading volume and low market caps. They are easily manipulated and you can get stuck in a position.  
  
35 - Don’t trade with money you need for living expenses. It’s called “risk capital” for a reason.  
  
36 - Think of yourself as a hunter – save your ammo for the big game.  
  
37 - Crypocurrency exchanges go down when there’s high volatility. If price hits a major target or buy zone, it might make sense to place some orders BEFORE everyone else.  
  
38 - Trading and investing brings all your emotions to the forefront – fear, greed, hesitation.  
  
39 - The hardest thing to do in trading is… NOTHING. This can also be the most profitable thing to do.  
  
40 - Just because a market is in a “bubble” doesn’t mean it’s going to die. Bitcoin has been through over half a dozen big bubbles and increased in price after each one.  
  
41 - Manage your trades in a way that would leave you with no regrets no matter what the market does.  
  
42 - Learn to think like a contrarian. If you’re someone who needs to have your opinion validated by everyone around you, then trading and investing isn’t for you.  
  
43 - The shorter the chart time frame, the less reliable the chart patterns are. The longer the time frame, the more variables affect price action and the harder it becomes to predict price. My sweet spot in the daily chart for trade setups and 60-minute chart for entries.  
  
44 - Some market conditions are great for pushing the gas on every trade setup you can find, where other market conditions call for you to slam on the brakes and step away from the markets altogether.  
  
45 - 90%+ of cryptocurrencies will eventually go to zero. Invest accordingly.  
  
46 - The mental side of trading is the hardest to master, the most under-appreciated skill, and will cause you to make or lose the biggest amounts of money.  
  
47 - The 3 biggest problems for traders are over-trading, hesitating on entries, and closing positions prior to profit targets when the trade is still intact.  
  
48 - You can make a career’s worth of profit in one year or one trade – don’t feel like every day has to be a home run. Play the long game. Be patient and wait for the best plays.  
  
49 - Don’t trust anyone else to trade for you. Manage your own high-risk investments (like crypto trading) or don’t participate at all.  
  
50 - Take the news for what it is – they’re trying to get views and clicks. They’re NOT looking out for your best interests or trying to help you make money.

simplelifestyle,"&gt; JPMorgan gave its financial advisors the green light to give all its wealth-management clients access to cryptocurrency funds, making it the first major US bank to do so, Insider has learned.
&gt; 
&gt; The bank, which has been making a significant push to grow its $630 billion wealth-management business, told advisors in a memo earlier this week that they can now take orders to buy and sell five cryptocurrency products, four from Grayscale Investments and one from Osprey Funds, effective July 19.
&gt; 
&gt; A person directly familiar with the move said it applies to all JPMorgan clients seeking investment advice, including its bank's self-directed clients using its commission-free Chase trading app, mass affluent clients whose assets are managed by financial advisors under JPMorgan Advisors, and ultrarich clients serviced by the private bank.
&gt; 
&gt; JPMorgan's advisors can execute only ""unsolicited"" crypto trades, meaning advisors cannot recommend the products but are allowed to buy or sell on the behalf of a client's request. The funds JPMorgan has approved include Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust, Bitcoin Cash Trust, Ethereum Trust, and Ethereum Classic vehicles, as well as Osprey Funds' Bitcoin Trust, the person said.
&gt; 
&gt; In April JPMorgan said it was preparing to offer an actively managed bitcoin fund to private wealth clients to be rolled out this summer, CoinDesk first reported.
&gt; 
&gt; The move marks a milestone in the bank's digital asset offerings, after its CEO, Jamie Dimon, threatened in 2017 to fire employees who traded bitcoin. While Dimon has since softened his sentiment toward crypto, he said in May that he was still not a supporter of the asset class despite growing client interest in it.
&gt; 
&gt; JPMorgan's asset and wealth-management chief, Mary Callahan Erdoes, told Bloomberg that many of the bank's clients view crypto as an asset class and want to invest in it.
&gt; 
&gt; Rival banks such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America have not given retail wealth clients direct access to crypto products. Morgan Stanley was the first big bank to begin offering wealthy clients — those with at least $2 million in invested assets — access to bitcoin funds, through a partnership with Galaxy Digital in April, CNBC reported.
&gt; 
&gt; Goldman Sachs started offering crypto futures trading to institutional clients and hedge funds last month. It told CNBC in March it was close to offering bitcoin and other digital assets to its wealthiest clients.",h64vqd2,2021-07-23 00:16:27,62

Ethereum enthusiasts are waiting for the delayed release of the London hard fork while trading with caution. The most notable Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) in the upgrade is EIP 1559. This, combined with the transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is considered equivalent to a “Triple Halving”. 

The upcoming London hard fork is a critical milestone in the Ethereum roadmap leading up to the release of ETH 2.0. It will change the protocol’s consensus algorithm from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake and restructure the monetary policy. 

Currently, transaction fees are calculated by the concept of the ""first-price auction.” Market participants bid a set price for miners to process their transactions and the highest bidder wins. However, this is set to change with EIP 1559. 

The network update will introduce a “base fee” for transactions to be included in a block. Users who wish to prioritize their transactions will have the option to add a “tip” or “priority fee” to incentivize miners for including their transactions in the next block. The higher the tip the bigger the chances for the transaction to be processed. 

EIP 1559 does not directly intend to make gas cheaper. The base fee will fluctuate by up to 12.5% after blocks are more than 50% full, which makes transaction fees predictable and transparent to prevent users from overpaying for gas. 

Among other changes that result from the EIP 1559 upgrade, the most notable one is that 70% of transaction fees on the Ethereum network will be burned, meaning that this supply will be deleted from circulation. The remaining 30% will be delivered to stakers as an additional staking reward, in addition to their regular issuance. 

The significant drop in Ether supply is key to drive Ethereum’s price since it makes it a deflationary asset. 

Popular Ethereum Researcher Nikhil Shamapant, mentioned in his research on EIP 1559  that

Given the significance of the upcoming protocol upgrade, the concept of “Ethereum Triple Halving” that started as an analogy on Crypto Twitter has evolved into an analysis of financial flows to predict what will happen to the price of Ethereum by January 2023. 

Ethereum’s Triple Halving has its roots in the reduction in supply, Following a successful upgrade to EIP 1559, a drop in sell pressure is expected. Analysts believe that  a 30% reduction of circulating Ether could take place, which is about half of the effect of a single Bitcoin halving. Meanwhile, the transition to PoS might result in a supply shock equivalent to two halvings. 

The much-awaited London hard fork was expected to go live this month, but after a delay, Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko proposed August 4 as the potential launch date. Other key developers will make a final decision on July 9. 

While the exact date of the network update remains to be decided, US multinational investment bank Goldman Sachs is bullish on Ethereum.

* An app store app with lots of viruses.
* Extreme delays getting the phones to customers, and no way of contacting someone about problems.
* No change in how carriers can track you.

The Freedom Phone is a new business venture started by Eric Finmen—the world's ""Youngest Bitcoin Millionaire.""

[*A boy wearing glasses and a button-up shirt, his hair combed to his right side. He has his arms folded and is staring wide-eyed into the camera. He is raising one eyebrow but not smiling, making him look awkwardly startled.*]

Wasn't he adorkable?

You see, his folks gave him $1000 to invest when he was 12.

He bought a bunch of Bitcoin.

Naturally.

And when he turned 18, it was worth over a million bucks.

By 21 he had 2.3 million dollars and was the pride of capitalism.

So obviously that makes him a $BUSINESS GENIUS$

And not \*INCREDIBLY LUCKY\*

And because he is a business genius, he has decided to start a new chapter of his life as an entrepreneur. Because we definitely don't have enough of those.

His first entrepreneurial BIG BOY IDEA is selling the FREEDOM PHONE.

Let's check out the on this bad from the [*Start link*] actual website. [*End link*]

[*Screenshot of product page*]

&gt;
&gt;Affordable, yet fast.

[*End screenshot*]

Large storage, you say?
6 inches of screen???
GREAT CAMERA!!!

Well, with specificity like that, I'm sold.

People get way caught up in the gigahertz and megapixels anyway. You don't need to know that stuff He says It is ""affordable, yet fast' and I choose to believe him.

I'm sure it is on par with every other $500 phone on the market—all while being made in the old U.S. of A.

Because you wouldn't call it a \*FREEDOM PHONE\* if it weren't American-made.

That would be dumb.

&gt;***""In fact, Freedom Phone appears to be a simple rebranding of a budget phone called the 'Umidigi A9 Pro, ' made by the Chinese tech company Umdigi. In an interview with The Daily Beast, Finman confirmed that the Freedom Phone was manufactured by Umdigi, but couldn’t say immediately which Umdigi phone it was based on.***
&gt;
&gt;***The Freedom Phone's $500 price tag would represent a substantial markup on the A9 Pro. The phone is available on Chinese retail giant AliExpress for $120—less than one-quarter of the price of a Freedom Phone.""***

###— The Daily Beast 

Oh.

Ummmmmmmmmm...

Is there anyone out there who can put a positive spin on this? Because I'm failing to think of anything at the moment.

[*Screenshot of Tweet*]

&gt;**Free 99**, @free99etx
&gt;
&gt;Replying to @Barnacules @erikfinman and @coffeebreak_YT You are not just paying for the phone. You are also paying for the OS. It is just like the IPhone. Part of the cost goes into the phone, but the same can be said for the OS. Also, while the phone is produced in China, FreedomOS is made in the USA. That is what I care about.

[*End screenshot*]

EXACTLY! The OS is chockfull of FREEDOM and that's what really matters.

Real AMERICAN developers toiled over the FreedomOS to make sure it was as free as humanly possible. I'm sure this OS is built from the ground up and that extra $400 expense is due to the extensive R&amp;D needed to create this marvel of digital liberty.

[*Screenshot of product page*]

&gt;[*FreedomOS logo: a gray outline of a rectangle with a light blue shield in it.*]
&gt;
&gt;Improved
&gt;
&gt;####A Free-Speech First Operating System
&gt;
&gt;We've developed the first mass-marketable mobile phone operating system based on free speech.

[*End screenshot*]

SEE! IT'S **BASED** ON FREE SPEECH!

Annnnd... it is **BASED** on something called GrapheneOS, apparently.

[*Screenshot of Wikipedia article titled “GrapheneOS”*]

&gt;GrapheneOS is an Android-based, security-hardened, privacy focused, free and open-source, mobile operating system for selected smartphones. It was known as Android Hardening until March 2019, and is focused on privacy and security. GrapheneOS is compatible with several Google Pixel smartphones.

[*End screenshot*]

Okay, so full disclosure.

The FreedomOS developers may have used an already Android fork and skinned it to mk more... Freedom-y. You saw the flag wallpaper, right?

[*Close-up of phone stock photo from the sales listing. Its wallpaper has nine airplanes flying in formation over the US flag, waving in the breeze on a clear sky.*]

Truthfully, licensing that wallpaper was the bulk of the development cost. They may not have done much beyond aesthetic tweaks.

That is... except for the **UNCENSORABLE APP STORE!!**

[*Screenshot of product page*]

&gt;Ban Free
&gt;
&gt;####Uncensorable App Store
&gt;
&gt;Our own app store. Read what you like. Watch what you like. Think what you like. Nothing is censored.

[*End screenshot*]

**\*patriotic fanfare***

**\*eagle caws in the distance***

**\*someone is shot in a hunting accident***

This is where that extra $400 of value comes in. No apps will censored. EVER. You can get your Gab and your Parler and your Gettr. And you never have to worry those apps being unavailable because Zuckerdumb sad NO

Okay, full disclosure again.

99% of the apps banned in the iPhone and Play stores are due to things like malware, viruses, and illegal activity. So for every Parler that goes uncensored—so does the app that looks just like Parler but is titled ""Parler Totally the Real One"" and IS full of viruses ready to steal your banking information. And an app store without restrictions could also end up being a haven for child pornography and illegal drug sales.

But hey... PARLER, AMIRITE?

Soooo... what if you don't like this incredible $500 phone worth $120?

Good news! There is a \*stellar\* return policy.

[*Screenshot of FAQ page*]

&gt;Q: What is the return policy if you don't like it?
&gt;
&gt;A: Customers may return their Freedom Phone **unopened** within 30 days of purchase. If the device is already opened, we do not offer returns at this time.

[*End screenshot*]

You get the box.

You stare at the box.

You DO NOT open the box.

And if that experience is unsatisfying, you can return that box within 30 days.

If you get the box.

Cut a hole in that box.

Stick your freedom in that box.

Well... hopefully you like it.

In conclusion, it's hard to put a price on freedom.

Sure, this is probably a giant grift.

And this conservative Bitcoin douche doesn't seem to mind grifting his own political brethren.

Because capitalism is his mistress and loyalty is fleeting in the ~~whitest~~ rightest of wings.

greenmachine822,"Long story, but I’ll break it down. I’ve never really done so, so will be a good moment of reflection for myself! Posting anonymously as I don’t want my main account to have this attached to it. Happy to answer any questions, though.

Age 12/13: Started to learn to code, Visual Basic to start with (I know…!). Was lucky, fell in love with it and slowly progressed through various languages before sticking with C++ and becoming an expert by around age 18, I’d say.

Age 14-16: Started to earn some income from writing game hacks/cheats, around $1-1.5k/month. Kinda knew that I didn’t need school anymore and grew an attitude. I was blowing all of the money on paying for game servers, my own lunch, clothes and stuff - childhood was rough and my parents weren’t around, so got away with it all.

Age 16-18: Left school with no education, was a naughty kid and was kicked out of a couple of schools - it was never for me. Stuck with the game cheats, kinda hit a bottleneck, various anti-cheat software started to hit the ‘business’ on and off. Started to get into things like botnets and so forth, but I never felt great about it, became concerned about legal issues too.

Age 18-22: Joined the military, felt like I needed to do something different with life. Eating cookies, drinking coke and fucking around with various code-related projects wasn’t doing it for me at the time. I wanted to move away for a while too, perhaps to escape. Completed two tours of Afghanistan, saw another side to people and the world, but decided this wasn’t for me and the money sucked.

Age 22-27: These were the crazy years and the most intense years of my life, I’d say. I co-created a game cheats business again, was making bank from that. Co-created a file host website, was making bank from that. Both businesses were with people I had met online playing games over the years.

Then started buying/selling domain names, made a lot of money from that venture.

Started to buy into Bitcoin around $2, just loved the whole scene. I had 30,000 BTC at one point (Yes, 30k!). Traded a lot, ended up about breakeven from that - was super stressful. Overall with BTC, made a hell load of money from holding, but wish I had kept hold of the BTC for way longer, hindsight is always 20/20 though, hey?

Started to invest in property, which now provides me with a passive income every month, probably like $5-6k/month profit.

Age 28-30: Travelled the world like crazy, first-class everywhere. Had the time of my life in Vegas and went back countless times, that’s a story for another day. Drunk far too much and did plenty of other stuff.

Age 30+: (Where I’m at now). I have multiple businesses, an Amazon FBA/eCommerce business, a SaaS statistics website, various Facebook affiliate marketing successes and the properties. Take home around $40k-50k/month now, net. Net worth is circa $5mil. 

My income does have its ups and downs. I’ve had plenty of bad runs in business too, but I’m up by far, overall. I don't really have to do anything with the businesses now as I have staff that can handle it all, but I love being involved, so I do.

Takeaways from it all?

Don’t write off anyone at first, you’ll be shocked what you can learn from people. Having said that, surround yourself with the right people and don’t stick around with those who you know aren’t going to help your situation.

Keep an open mind, don’t close doors too quickly on things, there’s money in nearly everything.

Nothing gets my blood rushing more than starting a new business, especially with the right people.

stargunner,"Good afternon, shibes! Yesterday was a wild ride. We learned that a rumor about Amazon accepting BTC by end of year helped fuel yesterday's rise, yet was later squashed by Amazon themselves, erasing a decent chunk of the rally.

Still, BTC remains solidly above 37K, a critical resistance point for months, now turning in to support. 

Dogecoin is happily sitting above 20 cents at the moment, with support beneaath it at 18 and resistance at 22.

Overall sentiment is still slowly dialing in to positive sentiment, though there are many more obstacles for a true bull run. Namely that Bitcoin must break low 40's resistance in order to truly break away from this accumulation phase. 

Bitcoin could just as easily end up back to the low 30's as it could testing 41K again. Shorts haven't given up just yet and fear still plagues the market. The set-up for the continuation of a bull market is there, but it may not be ready to run just yet. I hope i'm wrong, but for now I'm continuing to believe that we won't see any huge movements until the fall.

funtastrophe,"I'm not sure if it wholly applies here, but often the participatory effort is the action that creates the coins.  This is often the cryptocurrency alternative to relying on vast amounts of venture capital, as it doesn't cost the company out of pocket to dole out a token.  If it were ETH, they'd have to buy hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of ETH every day to pay participants off, which drastically increases the potential of the project folding.

From the participant's perspective, payment in a coin or token intrinsically linked to the project means that the initial value of the payments will be very low but very plentiful, but if the project flourishes, their value retroactively may become many, many times what it was when you started.  So if you were an early adopter of a project, then your loyalty in the days when the token was worth a penny and you were receiving ten bucks' worth a day would be rewarded greatly if the project succeeded in the end and the token moved to a value of a dollar, retroactively making those initial daily payments worth a thousand dollars each.  If they used an established coin like ETH, then there's no incentive to do the project in particular from a speculative standpoint, as ETH will do whatever it does whether or not the people running the project are skilled enough to ensure its success.  And even if Ethereum one day toppled Bitcoin as the dominant cryptocurrency, you're looking at a much lower potential return.",h6u5k5s,2021-07-29 00:00:28,3

Redpill_Crypto,"Yes sustainability is the most important aspect for any play to earn game.  


\- They need to introduce more utility in form of features that cost skill (long and shortterm investments)  
\- They need to increase character cost. For the amount you can earn ,the character cost is too low.  
\- They need to implement some type of character destruction to get rid of the ever increasing supply of characters  
\- They need to increase the value of reforging or present it differently in order to get people to reforge.  
\- They need to get rid of ingame skill or lower it significantly (why should I spent real skill if I can just use my ingame skill)  


Since Skill is more like gold/bitcoin in the scarcitiy aspect and won't increase, they can't do fractional reserve banking like the real world. They have to make sure more money flows into the economy and less gets out.  


There was a good reason why the US got rid of the gold standard.  You can't issue more gold backed fiat, than you have gold. And in this case its like if the US was selling their gold reserves to other countries and needed to figure out a way for foreign investors to invest back into the US (with gold)   


One thing they could do is to offer land, shares of companies, rights to produce or anything else that is valuable and feeds back huge amounts of (gold/skill) back into the economy.

Tricky_Troll,"Well I have still been handing out hopium that suggests it is just a mid-cycle pull back. My best selling hopium lately has been:

&gt;The ETH 2.0 merge is on its way. Even if it doesn’t launch as expected in Q1 2022, at some point before the end of next year, it is extremely likely that Ethereum will experience a 90% drop in its inflation and a 100% drop in ETH going to miners. Now for those of you who don’t know, miners create constant selling pressure because they have to sell their crypto to pay for their electricity bills. It’s a business with surprisingly slim profit margins for most. So what happens when Ethereum goes from $20-$50 million dollars of daily selling pressure from miners to $0? (the 0.5% inflation going to stakers will still be locked up until a later ETH 2 upgrade). Well based on Bitcoin’s history, ETH price will rise like crazy. I mean, it’s literally a triple fucking halving! 3x the effect of that thing which has started a Bitcoin bull run every time without fail.",h6xgxaj,2021-07-29 16:02:51,2

MobTwo,"Long story short is that Bitcoin Cash is the highly improved version of BTC. Anyone can verify for themselves. Just send $10 worth of BTC and $10 worth of Bitcoin Cash from your own wallet A (not an exchange) to your own wallet B (not an exchange) and see for yourself the difference. But Bitcoin Cash is more than just fast cheap and reliable, it has many unique advantages over the old tech BTC (forever stuck on 1mb). Here are the improvements from Bitcoin Cash.

&amp;nbsp;

**Better Security** – BTC has a vulnerability called RBF which increases the risk of double spending. Bitcoin Cash developers aim to make 0-confirmation transactions safe again so that anyone accepting Bitcoin Cash is much safer accepting payments without having to wait for multiple confirmations. This RBF security vulnerability exists only in BTC and not Bitcoin Cash. That's why Bitcoin Cash is more secure as a payment method.

Here is an example of hackers stolen $150000 worth of BTC using the RBF security vulnerability. https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/03/14/double-spenders-scam-150000-bitcoin/

It is super easy to double spend on Bitcoin using the RBF vulnerability. Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/video-shows-how-easy-it-is-to-double-spend-btc-using-rbf/

&amp;nbsp;

**Rapidly Growing Transactions Volume** - Bitcoin Cash has more transactions than BTC+Lightning Network combined recently. On some days, Bitcoin Cash has more than double the transactions volume of BTC. Bitcoin Cash is growing rapidly while BTC is on the decline.

&amp;nbsp;

**Defi Smart Contracts** - Bitcoin Cash has defi smart contracts functionalities (eg. AnyHedge, Detoken, SmartBCH). SmartBCH allows Ethereum smart contracts to be deployed as a sidechain to the Bitcoin Cash network. This means as an Ethereum developer, you no longer has any friction jumping over to join the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem. All of them can come over to the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem to enjoy the low transaction fees of Bitcoin Cash.

&amp;nbsp;

**Low Fees** – One of the advantages of using cryptocurrencies over traditional payment methods is the low fees. Due to the limited block size of BTC, fees have exceeded over $70/transaction during peak period. On the other hand, I have never paid more than 1 penny/transaction during my entire time in using Bitcoin Cash. This makes using Bitcoin Cash ideal for merchants, businesses, companies and everyday usage. The industries that may be disrupted such as Remittances, Derivatives, Payment Gateways, etc are worth trillions of dollars and Bitcoin Cash is well positioned for use cases in these industries.

&amp;nbsp;

**Improved Scalability** – BTC is limited to 1MB blocksize and even with Segwit activated, the capacity increase is only around 1.7x whereas the upgraded Bitcoin Cash blocks capacity is currently at 32x with no limitations. This means Bitcoin Cash can handle PayPal transactions volume today and be global money after a few more upgrades.

&amp;nbsp;

**Supply Scarcity** – During the fork from Bitcoin, some Bitcoin Cash supply were removed from active circulation due to users unable to claim their Bitcoin Cash from unsupported exchanges and wallets among other reasons. This means each Bitcoin Cash is actually more scarce than BTC.

&amp;nbsp;

**Improved Confirmation Times** – Due to the limited block size of BTC, some users were made to wait days for their transactions to be confirmed. Contrast this to Bitcoin Cash where transactions may be accepted immediately with less risk and you can see why it makes sense to use Bitcoin Cash. In other words, if you are a shop owner and you just sold a cup of coffee and some sandwiches, and you accept the old BTC, you may have to wait hours for the transaction to be confirmed because the customer may use RBF to void the original payment. With Bitcoin Cash, your risk is minimized.

&amp;nbsp;

**Higher Merchants Adoption** - Bitcoin Cash is global money with more than 2,651,820 merchants accepting it. You can pay for your hotels, air tickets, food/drinks, groceries, nightlife, and more with Bitcoin Cash today. Source: https://1bch.com/?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame

While Bitcoin Cash adoption is growing very quickly every single day, Bitcoin is having declining adoption and if this trend continues then Bitcoin is on a dead end. Source: https://np.reddit.com/r/NotAcceptingBitcoin/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all

&amp;nbsp;

**Lightning Network Problems And Vulnerabilities And Loss Funds** - Some people may claim Lightning Network will solve Bitcoin problems but it has failed to gain traction due to many problems and vulnerabilities, such as loss of funds, unreliable transactions (constantly failing), and many other vulnerabilities.

&amp;nbsp;

**Disadvantages of Bitcoin Cash** - Unfortunately, for the past 5 years, Bitcoin Cash has been constantly undermined by lies, propaganda, censorships and other malicious activities...

**1e) Plus a bunch of other unethical stuff** if you care to read more at https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/hgpjph/the_pitiful_state_of_bitcoin_cash_transactions/fw5qczk/

Anyone who dares to promote increasing the blocksize or favorably on Bitcoin Cash, they got banned and their voices silenced in the Bitcoin or Cryptocurrency subreddit. They also get harassed and attacked by online paid trolls. All these started back in 2015 even before Bitcoin Cash existed.

&amp;nbsp;

**""Digital Gold"" Or ""Store Of Value"" Propaganda** - BTC is good with propaganda but this is simple economics. Something cannot be a store of value without it first be a means of exchange. Bitcoin Cash is both a store of value AND means of exchange thanks to its low fees. Bitcoin is not feasible as a means of exchange due to its high fees of around $10 (or more) per transaction.

&gt; Store of Value: To act as a store of value, money must be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved. It must be predictably usable as a medium of exchange when it is retrieved. Additionally, the value of money must remain stable over time.

&gt; Source: https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-economics/chapter/introducing-money/

&amp;nbsp;

**Tokens** - Today, anyone can issue their own loyalty tokens or digital money on Bitcoin Cash from as low as 1 cent. It's incredibly easy and anyone can do it at https://mint.bitcoin.com/.

**Increased Privacy** - Bitcoin Cash has better privacy than BTC thanks to CashShuffle/CashFusion. You can enable it through the setting in the Electron Cash wallet and it's completely optional. If you don't want others to know how you spent your money, it is better to use Bitcoin Cash over BTC.

&amp;nbsp;

**Continuous Innovations** - For example, Cash Accounts allow people to send BCH to an easy to remember non-custodial alias such as MobTwo#12345. You may register your Cash Account at https://www.cashaccount.info/

Together with Reusable Payment Addresses (RPA), Cash Accounts will allow people to send BCH to your easy to remember alias with increased privacy. You can read more about RPA at https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/o1z8a1/help_me_test_the_prototype_of_electron_cash_rpa/

Many more innovations on BCH not covered in this comment to avoid turning this into an encyclopedia.

&amp;nbsp;

**Better Risk/Reward** - If BTC gains another 1 trillion marketcap, it only 2x in price. But that same 1 trillion will give you around 68x your Bitcoin Cash investments. It is such a smarter option given the risk/rewards probabilities. As an investor, it make sense to know the difference between price and value. Bitcoin Cash has a high value low price while BTC has low value high price.

&amp;nbsp;

At the moment, the old BTC has first mover advantage (eg. Friendster or MySpace or Kodak or Nokia) but that can only last them to a point. Eventually, I believe that Bitcoin Cash will overtake BTC's marketcap. Bitcoin Cash is the second opportunity to buy Bitcoin at a low price if you missed that opportunity back in 2013.",h706dsk,2021-07-30 06:12:16,4
nocendi,"&gt;Firmaet skatter på inntekt og div avgifter (om man tenker på en avgift som en skatt)

De hadde et overskudd på 2,2 milliarder i 2020, og betalte 0 i skatt. Faktisk fikk de tilbake 57 000,- på skatten. 

Til deres forsvar så betalte de 560 millioner i skatt på konsernbasis, så det er i alle fall *noe*, selv om det kom ut av operasjonelt selskap og ikke holdingselskapet. 

&gt;Aksjonærene skatter på utbytte.

Det er ikke sant. Nesten alle aksjonærene (inkludert familien Witzøe) er selskaper. De betaler ikke skatt på utbytte. Det er det bare ~~nissene~~ personlige aksjonærer som gjør. Og de har SalMar ganske få av. 

&gt;Både han og sønnen skatter når de tar penger ut av selskapet, eller selger aksjer.

Helt klart. Men med en slik formue så er det ikke så ofte du har bruk for det. Privatøkonomien kan fint finansieres via en ELOC. 

&gt;De ansatte skatter av inntekten.

De har 38 ansatte. Resten er innleid fra Polen. Jeg mener det er prinsipielt idiotisk å gi et firma ""æren"" for skatten deres ansatte betaler, men i SalMar sitt tilfele er det irrelevant, siden de nesten ikke har ansatte. 

&gt;Det finnes bedre og mer samfunnsnyttige løsninger enn formue skatt. 

Det kan vi være enige om, men vi vet nok begge to at familien Witzøe kommer til å skrike like høyt uansett *hvordan* de blir skattelagt.

Det er mange selskap i Norge som har oppriktige problemer på grunn av formueskatten. SalMar er ikke en av de. Dette er et selskap som bokstavelig talt driter penger. 

&gt;Man kan f.eks øke beskatning på uttak på aksje kapital.

Siden ingen av de tar ut særlig mye i personlig utbytte tror jeg ikke det ville ha noen betydning.

Den åpenbare løsningen er et avgiftssystem i likhet med oljebransjen. Men dette ville fort blitt 30-40% av overskuddet, og jeg kan love deg at Witzøe hadde blitt lynende forbannet om noen foreslo *det*. 

&gt;Jeg sier ikke at de ikke har råd til å betale formueskatten, men jeg forstår også godt at det er økonomisk gunstig å flytte driften ut av landet når du ender med å betale skatt for å ta ut penger til å betale skatt med

Selvsagt. Det er økonomisk ugunstig for alle som tjener penger å bo i en velferdsstat. Har du god inntekt, er det ingen steder i verden som er bedre å bo enn Monaco, Andorra, Bahamas eller UAE. Men dette er altså en familie som har blitt griserike på å utnytte felles naturressurser.

De burde stå absolutt nederst på sympatilisten. 

&gt;Eller for å si det på en annen måte, om du kjøpte 1000 bitcoin for 15 år siden, hadde du nå hatt en formidabel formue, som du måtte betalt skatt av om du har en inntekt på 500k i året og får en formueskatt på 900k så må du selge BTC, betale skatt på salget, og deretter betale formueskatten

Ja, selvsagt, og det er helt greit. Her er det ingen arbeidskapital som tappes, og det er derfor heller ingen problemer med formueskatt.",h706dvp,2021-07-30 06:12:17,4

throwaway55667701,"This is fair criticism, but regulatory risk is something that every industry deals with. The problem is, crypto is especially weak in its ability to counter this threat. This is what I mean:

Large banks have large consortiums of lobbyists, lawyers, and public relations teams that ensure that, even when their failings are on full display, their interests are advocated for at the highest levels of government power.

In contrast, in the crypto space, its decentralized nature means there's no corporate board hiring PR firms, there's no CEO that can be a lightening rod on CNBC and advocate for the benefits that his organization brings to the economy (Buterin and Hoskinson =/= Solomon and Dimon). There's no head of the organization that can hire a bevy of lobbyists to grease the palms of congressmen and senators.

Why this matters: the first time crypto shines it ass (and it will - every unregulated market gets frothy from time to time and The Great Bitcoin Recession of 2031 is going to wipe out trillions in global wealth), the government is going to reg the shit out of the tech. But unlike 2007-2009, there's going to be no centralized system to push back on reactionary and ill-informed government overreach.

All to say, expect uneducated/ill-informed overreaching regulations of crypto in a way that wasn't analogously reflected with large banks. We have to move smart folks who have trained themselves to think about pure tech problems only, and start having them think about how the industry is going to react to inevitable regulation.

tonybarnaby,"Interoperability

Interoperability across blockchains is an often-discussed topic, and many projects have been proposed specifically to address this challenge. With reliable transactions across blockchains, true network effects can be realized in the decentralized economy.

The first example of blockchain interoperability was atomic swaps between Bitcoin and Litecoin. The trustless exchange of Bitcoin for Litecoin and vice-versa is made possible not through in-protocol mechanisms, but through a shared cryptographic standard (specifically usage of the SHA2-256 hash function).

Similarly, the design of Ethereum 2.0 allows for interconnection of many shard chains, all running the same protocol and utilizing the same cryptographic primitives. This uniformity will be valuable when customizing the protocol for inter-shard communication, however Ethereum 2.0 will not be interoperable with other blockchains that do not utilize the same cryptographic primitives.

Networks of blockchains such as Polkadot or Cosmos go one-step further, allowing blockchains built with the same framework (Cosmos SDK for Cosmos and Substrate for Polkadot) to communicate and interact with one another. These frameworks provide developers some flexibility in building their own protocols, and ensure the availability of identical cryptographic primitives, allowing each chain to parse one another's blocks and cross-validate transactions. However, both protocols rely on bridges or ""pegging zones"" to connect to blockchains that are not constructed with their own frameworks, introducing an additional layer of trust. To demonstrate: though Cosmos and Polkadot enable ""networks of blockchains"", the Cosmos and Polkadot networks are not designed to be interoperable with each other.

The crypto-economics of cross-chain networks may need further study as well. For both Cosmos and Polkadot, native tokens are used for staking, governance and transaction fees. Putting aside the crypto-economic dynamics introduced by staking, which can't alone give a native token intrinsic value (discussed in 4.2.4), reliance on cross-chain transactions to capture ecosystem value can be a weak model. In particular, cross-chain transactions are a weakness, not a strength of multi-chain networks, just as cross-shard transactions are a weakness of sharded databases. They introduce latency, as well as the loss of atomicity and composability. There is a natural tendency for applications that need to interact with each other to eventually move to reside on the same blockchain to reduce cross-chain overhead, reducing the demand for cross-chain transactions and therefore demand for the native token.

Cross-chain networks benefit from network effects - the more interconnected chains there are in a network, the more valuable the network is, and the more attractive it is to potential new participants in the network. Ideally, such value would be captured by the native token and used to further encourage the growth of the network. However, in a pooled security network such as Polkadot, higher cost of network participation becomes a deterrent for the network to accrue further value. In a loosely connected network like Cosmos, if we assume same cross-chain transaction demand and fees, higher cost of staking participation lowers the expected return for validators, discouraging further staking participation.

With its layered approach, the Nervos Network is also a multi-chain network. Architecturally, Nervos uses the cell model and a low-level virtual machine to support true customization and user-created cryptographic primitives, enabling interoperability across heterogeneous blockchains (covered in 4.4.1). Crypto-economically, the Nervos Network concentrates value (instead of message passing) to its root chain. This mechanism raises the network's security budget as the aggregate value secured by the network rises.",h744um2,2021-07-31 03:45:20,4

Currently safemoon does appear to have less use cases than 2009 Bitcoin which was used quite a bit. Hopefully safemoon v2 changes things then again it may never happen with the current track record. But I don’t see how it’s beneficial to hold the coin right now when it is clear whales are selling. Wouldn’t it be better to pick it up after the $30t in combined seller bags are done selling?

And the idea that it'll be more robust in it's ability to play pc games i think is more than enough for a gaggle of people to rush out and buy it. Again. I'm very very sure it won't kill the switch. But it will without doubt (if it works anywhere near like they say it will) seriously eat into the switch's profits.

Right now there's a shortage in graphics cards on account of both covid-19 and the materials to make them. With bitcoin also accounting for the very small amount of graphics cards on the market. Pc gamers are usually some of the most annoying, fucked up gamers you'll ever meet. Like playing a fps with your speakers on is a massive lesson in having the patience of a god. Doing that on pc though? You'll be pressing the mute button more than the shoot button. lol

jamesnine,"I signed up for Mt. Gox back in 2010 or 2011 (my earliest email is from 2011, but I could've sworn I signed up earlier).  I held mistakenly left Bitcoins on there after they shut down too, so I'm a member of the insolvency--lesson learned.

As far as I remember, there was no limit to how many Bitcoins you can buy.  The site had a very good amount of liquidity at the time.  Kraken and Coinbase were just starting at the time, so nobody felt they were as trustworthy as Mt. Gox at the time.

An issue I had w/ Mt. Gox at first, were the smaller deposit and withdrawal limits per day, but I don't remember what those limits were.  I do remember how restrictive it was though, until I finally gave in and did KYC, and those limits were brought up (according to an old email from them, it says 10x the existing daily limits).

Another issue was that all exchanges (Mt. Gox especially; but BTC-e, Coinbase, and Kraken were just as bad) frequently went down due to high volume or violent price spikes--this made trading Bitcoin very frustrating, esp. when prices started to plummet and everyone wanted to sell, or vice versa; when prices shot up fast and everyone was rushing to buy.  It seems none of the exchanges were prepared for high volume or knew how to scale properly (at the time).

mimetist,"There are not that many ways to put currency into circulation.

1. Government mandate.
2. Employer - Employee contracts.
3. Black markets.

&amp;#x200B;

1. The most obvious is the first one. The politic powers can change laws in order to make mandatory the usage of any currency. Europe countries did make mandatory the usage of the EUR and stopped using their own ""local"" currencies in the 90s (Pesetas from Spain, Francs from France, Marks from Germany, etc).

2. The second is by contracts. Assuming that outside of the legal minimum wage that might be mandatory to pay with fiat money, anyone can negotiate with his employer or employees any kind of payment that they agree on.

For example, many members of the directive boards get their houses, cars and many other services paid by the company instead of having higher (fiat) salaries. That way they don't lose as much in taxes.

Other example is from a NFL player, Russell Okung, who asked for his salary to be paid in BitCoins.

3. The last option is ""black markets"", where you can literally pay with anything that the other part is willing to accept.

In many countries that have their fiat currency very undervalued because of hyperinflation, people stop using the official currency as a mean to exchange. Argentinians tried to buy US dollars as soon as they had any local currency in their hands.

BitCoin can be considered a form of black market, since it is not regulated yet. But this discussion deserves more technical and philosophical attention.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, what you were thinking about ""going back to the gold standard"" can only be approached safely following the first point. The second point can accelerate the process if the government sees that there is no way of stopping it. The third point is only useful if the country is at the brink of collapse and you want to abandon it.",h7ctu7a,2021-08-02 06:10:28,2

My name is Jessica, and I'm your genuine, down to earth, girl next door. You’ll soon find that beneath my sweet, natural appearance lies a kinky side and a ravenous sexual appetite. I can range from bubbly and sweet to strict and mean when the time is right.

I'm a tall 5'-7"" with an ass that will make your jaw drop to the floor and hypnotizing hazel eyes that will have you coming back for more. One of the biggest compliments I get other than my rocking ass is how genuine I can be compared to their other previous experiences. I'm all natural and rarely if ever wear makeup and have a delicious trimmed pussy.

When I'm not pleasing you I'm spinning fire, playing in my garden, cooking amazing meals and playing retro video games.

Immediately after that was when the first Bitcoin rush went into overdrive and you could not find a GPU *anywhere*. I was stuck on integrated video for over a year. It was a living nightmare. Finally, I was able to pick up a new RX580 at MRSP and life was good.

Then, a while back, I was considering upgrading, but Covid was really starting to heat up. Within about ten minutes of hearing the rumor that they were going to quarantine Shenzhen I panic ordered a new 5700XT and an extra 1TB SSD for more game storage. I absolutely did *not* want to be stuck with the same GPU for another year or more again.

Right after it arrived, Covid and another crypto surge spiked GPU prices, so I bought it at the perfect time. Now we have the coof, crypto going apeshit, and a chip shortage, so if things keep going they way they are I'm going to run this beautiful card until the fans fall off.

[https://centerpointsecurities.com/short-squeezes/](https://centerpointsecurities.com/short-squeezes/)

A little guide and what happens to price after one.

What do these 2 combined accomplish? Simple...Create massive liquidity to provide an exit in a low volume/low liquidity market. It is a bait to trap new entrants. Our 29k crab market was the perfect primer. Market makers can now exit properly with high profits as momentum was ignited triggering a short squeeze and a slew of new market entrants.

Return of the bull ? Not if these 2 metrics are accurate. So where do we go from here?  

Part 3 is a Bump and run.

[https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=chart\_analysis:chart\_patterns:bump\_and\_run\_reversal\_reversal](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=chart_analysis:chart_patterns:bump_and_run_reversal_reversal)

The Lead in line is prior to the bump and run (short squeeze) aided by the ignition bot.

[https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/h/h9rCbeIa.png](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/h/h9rCbeIa.png)

As you can see, we have fallen out of the lead in line and bleeding down to prior lead in pricing. Without the ignition bot, the market has no spot buying power to prop prices up...so why use it now? Market conditions were perfect for a short squeeze enabling them maximum efficiency. When all 3 are combined you begin understanding why the price is behaving they way it has and how to trade it. I tried explaining it to people in a few prior posts but the jubilation of a price rise from investors and not traders drowns out any meaningful discussion.

Finally the last nail. MACRO

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/HG2Un3O7/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/HG2Un3O7/)

Bonds have fallen, the US market is showing weakness. If you check the graph, Bonds dropping proceeds a greater market shift downward. We are due for a pullback on the SP500, bonds will give us a heads up. 

Ill end this with...this is just what im seeing and sharing with you guys. Do with the information what you will. Im moving forward with the assumption the first 3 parts are factual and trading accordingly.

ConohaConcordia,"For stocks, it really depends on “which one”. Some stocks, for example Tesla, are notoriously overpriced. Others, while certainly being traded at a premium, are still being traded with a substance other than the confidence in mind. Whether this substance is far lower than the trading prices of the stock is irrelevant; the fact that stocks has some substance to begin with means Bitcoin will always be more volatile, since it has little substance to back it up.

In my opinion whether — or how hard — Bitcoin crashes ultimately comes down to the events surrounding the asset, not the prices itself.

Elon sold the cryptocurrency when the confidence is high and ironically, by selling he boosted the confidence in it. 

In a different setting, Chinese ban on Bitcoin triggered an immediate crash long before any hash rate reductions came into effect. If $200m was dump *then*, I’d say it will be possible to drive the prices all the way down to $20k which would be about 50% before the news about the ban.

The intention also matters. Elon sold $100m but he had no vested interest in driving the prices down — rather he would like it to be as high as possible, so he probably traded accordingly. If the same $100m was used explicitly to drive down prices, then the effects will be very different.",h7k4tgf,2021-08-03 23:56:34,1

- **No premine** (Satoshi didn’t grant himself any coins)
- **Gave a 2 month heads up before launching the network** (no sudden release and no mining before release)
- **Coins had no value for 1.5 years so they circulated freely** (this cannot even be replicated)
- **Satoshi never cashed out** (unlike every other founder in history and I bet it stays that way for eternity)

“Putting everything else about bitcoin aside, there will never be another cryptocurrency that is launched as fairly as bitcoin, for all of eternity, because bitcoin's fair launch cannot ever be replicated. Now that the genies out of the bottle and bitcoin is here, it's 100% impossible to ever have a cryptocurrency where the coins are circulating in the wild freely for 18 months before having any value. I also don't think that we'll ever see another cryptocurrency created where the founder never cashes out.”

SquidBolado,"OP, I mean this in the most respectful way possible, but I don't see how you intend to turn 5-7k into 20k in 4 years. I understand that the whole point of your post here is to kind of ask ~how~ you can do that, but as you may have gathered, there isn't a magic investment you can make. The easiest way to accumulate wealth when you don't have a lot to start with is by literally not spending money.

You've mentioned you're living paycheck to paycheck. This heavily implies you're saving next to nothing each month. In which case, how will you be able to top-up those 5-7k each month, so that you reach 20? In the absolute best case scenario where you start with 7k, you will need to save around £270 a month to make back £20k in 4 years. If your starting from £5k, that number turns to £312. Can you do that? 

This subreddit is about responsible money management, and as such there is no magic way you can make the journey to your goal easier by investing in something. If you're truly dedicated to making £20k in 4 years without actually saving money, you could attempt to YOLO it on something like bitcoin or whatever - but be ready to also lose all your cash. From your post history someone mentioned you may have a gambling problem and therefore I wouldn't recommend this. 

Final word of advice. If you want to get out of the hole, you need to manage your spendings or do your best to find a better source of income. As I mentioned, the *only* way to accumulate wealth when you have nothing to begin with is to save your money, and be resposible. Good luck!",h7nq5aq,2021-08-04 18:30:55,43

VictorCobra,"Hey everyone, content update! I just made a new [analysis](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TOTAL/JdqCzeC9-Crypto-Set-to-Eclipse-Gold-The-Long-Term-Bullish-Trend/) about the TOTAL crypto market cap. It actually seems like the Gold market cap is within reach (even this cycle, believe it or not). More downside here would probably invalidate this idea, but it's fun to speculate :)

The last drop below $30k DID actually end up being a bear trap. One of the main reasons I was skeptical was the extreme negative funding on Binance futures. [Here's](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/Fo2bVgO4-Setting-Up-For-A-Bear-Trap-Taking-The-Uncomfortable-Trade/) a more in-depth analysis about why I thought this was possible. I always find periods of low sentiment and high uncertainty to be the most interesting.

Bitcoin has now broken all the possible downtrends I was looking at back in June, though it took a while. This includes most iterations of the curved downtrend (yellow). [This](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/ZupUxHeT-Bitcoin-Roadmap-For-The-Months-Ahead-Looking-For-Liquidity/) analysis showed why I expected a test of this level, even prior to more potential downside.

I also made a [video](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/Cz9dOYvS-Victor-Cobra-s-Crypto-Market-Update-7-27-21-The-Short-Squeeze/) about what I'm speculating about for Bitcoin if the cycle is not over yet. $46-48k seems like the strongest resistance zone. Breaking above $42k and consolidating there for some time would be very bullish. Support is now at $38k.

Bitcoin bounced against [SPX right on the money,](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/1lrZESlQ-The-Bitcoin-SPX-Ratio-Presents-A-Possible-Buy-Signal/) which is interesting.  Would have been embarrassing if it broke down to new lows, since that was the first post I've ever made to be featured on the front page of TradingView. Hope I'm not jinxing it. There's still a lot of regulatory uncertainty, but the cat's out of the bag, I suppose.

I chose the business, eventually — and for a multitude of reasons, that went bust and $500,000 is now gone. Poof.

I’ve never gone back to look at what $500K in Apple would be today. And don’t care, because I didn’t invest it in that then. And there’s nothing to say I wouldn’t have sold all of it as soon as it was up 20%, overjoyed.

astrokey,"Looking at the Pluto return solely from the basis of finances is too limiting. Assuming natal Pluto is in the US chart’s second house, we are referring to finances but only from the perspective of what we own and what’s considered to be in *our* (as a country) possession. That means this transit has more to do with the country’s sense of security (material wealth, power, self-esteem, a sense of identity) than just bitcoin. Likely we are looking at the US as the global superpower coming to an end. It’s right there if you look - a country of people who can’t collectively agree on anything, tear each other down, do what they can to make money off of others, living only for selfish means and not for community, and who continue to elect ill-intentioned politicians at every level (from local to federal). We have an identity crisis on our hands, and it’s going to lead to a lot of disappointment when people realize the US is losing its place in current global affairs. I find myself identifying (and desiring) more and more to have cultural shifts and customs found in other countries (whether it be a change in healthcare, education, housing, etc.) and I’m not alone. The US is a narcissistic shitshow, and Pluto is here to put an end to toxicity and bullshit. I’m fine with that. I’m tired of living in a country where healthcare, housing, public education, childcare, and parental leave are abysmal yet all people care about it what’s trending on FB or tik tok. Neptune opp Neptune shows the US is in a state of delusion, and it will be a long difficult road to rediscovering our new, sustainable identity as a country. It will not be easy, but as with all Pluto transits, it is absolutely necessary.",h7riuxd,2021-08-05 12:46:15,94

MerHeNomadic,"TLDR: De auteur van het essay combineert wat mij betreft twee totaal verschillende onderwerpen in één essay zonder ze correct te verbinden. Ik schrijf een wat lange reactie op het wat lange essay als schrijver van het in het essay genoemde boek.

Tsja het is inderdaad wel wat lang, maar ook interessant om te zien hoe de Groene Amsterdammer auteur Marja Pruis aankijkt tegen inmiddels schijnbaar populaire persoonlijke financiën keukentafel-onderwerpen.  
Ik vind het leuk dat de auteur mensen als Sander Schimmelpenninck en Ernst-Jan Pfauth en de titel van mijn boek Van F\*ck You Money tot FIRE noemt. Ik vind het jammer dat ze het boek wel noemt maar overduidelijk niet heeft gelezen. 

Het verbaast me dat dit in combinatie gaat met het noemen van Sywert van Lienden en de focus op graaicultuur, bitcoin-oplichters en zestienjarige sneakerverkopers. De auteur van het essay combineert wat mij betreft twee totaal verschillende onderwerpen in één essay zonder ze correct te verbinden.  
Het eerste deel (en de titel van het artikel) lijkt te gaan over jonge ondernemers met een drang naar rijk worden; een beetje als reactie op hebberigheid en graaimentaliteit a la Sywert van Lienden, Miljonair clubs en Bitcoin- of Vastgoed-coaches. Het tweede onderwerp lijkt meer te gaan over geldbewustzijn en FIRE.  
Op het moment dat gesproken wordt over ""Zoek de impliciete aannames in deze redenering: ambtenaren werken voor een laag salaris; slimme mensen zijn te koop; als je slim bent, ben je rijk; als je niet voor een mega-salaris werkt ben je dom"" vind ik dat de auteur een belangrijk punt mist, namelijk dat FIRE juist helemaal niet is voor 'slimme', hebberige, op rijkdom gefocuste ondernemende types. FIRE gaat niet over snel rijk worden. FIRE gaat dit soort types volgens mij veel te langzaam.  
Wat ik ook vind ontbreken is het plaatsen van FIRE in de huidige tijdsgeest, juist in Groene Amsterdammer termen en kringen, waar ook het zelf verantwoordelijker worden voor inkomen nu en later, en niet per se rijk worden, steeds belangrijker wordt.  
Op het moment dat de auteur stelt ""De 'politiek’, de overheid, zal de economie van het genoeg moeten bewerkstelligen; weer meer naar zich toetrekken in plaats van zijn burgers uitleveren aan de wetten van de markt. Het moge inderdaad duidelijk zijn dat op die markt alleen de toch-al-welgestelden uit de voeten kunnen"" gaat ze er vanuit dat niet de burger maar de overheid wel gaat zorgen voor een vangnet en voorzieningen. Ikzelf ben juist bang dat dit in de toekomst onbetaalbaar wordt voor de overheid, dat dit betekent een hogere pensioenleeftijd en lagere bedragen, wellicht zelfs zeer magere basis AOW en dat we juist daarom veel eerder moeten beginnen met voor ons eigen financiële vangnet zorgen.  
Ik ben inderdaad zoals de auteur het noemt een missionaris. Ik pleit inderdaad voor F\*ck You Money voor iedereen. Maar dit is juist het vangnet, dit is juist om zelfstandiger te worden, je eigen beslissingen te kunnen nemen zonder te hoeven leunen op de overheid, ook als het een keer tegenzit. Het gaat niet om ""Wat zou ik doen met negen miljoen euro, en dan doel ik dus op dingen die ik nu niet denk te kunnen doen?"" Dit is echt ver van de werkelijkheid. Dit past misschien wel bij het het stuk over ""Waarom kan ik dan toch het gevoel krijgen een sukkel te zijn als ik lees over de kennelijk ‘snelle’ manier waarmee anderen ‘binnenlopen’?"" maar het past wat mij betreft totaal niet bij FIRE.  
En als het gaat om goed doen, of dat nou koffiebonen plukken in Nicaragua is of iets heel anders, denk ik dat juist als je voor financiële zekerheid, financiële vrijheid en financiële onafhankelijkheid hebt gezorgd je kunt richten op je inzetten voor iets terugdoen en meer zinvolle dingen ondernemen dan alleen maar geld verdienen.",h7roxl7,2021-08-05 13:45:25,40

insanemetal187,"Eventually people who can't print USD will get sick of having to produce real value to get USD while the US just prints away.  Any country pegged to the dollar is having their currency debased without any ability to stop it.  This is why Russia is trying to move away from USD for gas purchasing.  China is working on a digital currency to try and compete.  Also if Bitcoin has any success in El Salvador expect other small countries that depend on USD to follow suit.  

At some point people who are far away from the money printer but who have control over their money supply will get upset and seek alternatives.  The only thing really stopping that right now is the US military and as we have spent 20 years and have not been able to declare an absolute victory over a bunch of farmers basically.

DeMemeTree_OMG,"Welcome to Monero!

What happens after you take the coins off the exchange you're correct in assuming no one can trace the transaction to the Bible study group. You may want to study up on some of the key features that make this possible. I'm not 100% of the privacy with MyMonero mobile wallet but I'm guessing that it uses a remote node. Technically you should use a remote node you control or a full node for the utmost privacy.

However, keep in mind that the exchange now knows you have X amount of Monero. Someday when your gov or some regulatory body finally catches up (BTW these mofos are years behind in terms of understanding tech so might not be for a while) will potentially want to have some tx proof or have us submit something to show what we did with that money.

This is where the boating accident meme comes from. I lost my seed words and that money the exchange thinks I had is no longer under my control. Since this isn't bitcoin no one can see any addresses so as long as you don't take X back to the exchange that you claimed to lost it at you should be good to go.

This will decrease Bitcoin's volatility by increasing buy limit support which is critical to both investor confidence and Bitcoin maturing into a stable currency and a less volatile unit of account. The side benefit is you can auto pickup any dips and save money.

12) Help answer new user questions on r/BitcoinBeginners

13) Invest in more Bitcoin , but focus on spending and replacing as well to support local businesses that accept Bitcoin. 

14) Help local Merchants accept Bitcoin

14) Donate to open source bitcoin projects and other bitcoin-related volunteer efforts.

15) Provide liquidity in joinmarket

16) Provide liquidity on Bisq

17) Buy Bitcoin and securely store it

Where are the new offices, all the new coders? It’s starting to look sketchy.

ExtremePrivilege,"&gt;The proposed legislation, if passed, would have a significant impact on both investors and exchanges. Exchanges will need to undertake significant efforts to comply with the reporting regime. Investors, on the other hand, won’t have to “do” anything. But under the new law, all of the information that the IRS would normally receive when an investor sells a share of Amazon stock will now be sent to the IRS when an investor sells one Bitcoin, one Ethereum, or the like. There’s a lot to be sorted out: what will happen with crypto stored in cold storage, wallets not on exchanges, so-called “self custody.” The proposed legislation does not address this “self-custody” cryptocurrency, because it is analogous to cash under a mattress. It is difficult to trace and even more difficult to devise an information reporting scheme that would encompass such an asset. Individual cryptocurrency owners and investors must still pay attention, however, because it is even more likely that the IRS will be made aware of their transactions and expect them to be reported on a tax return.

The crux of the issue is that the new amendment requires ""brokers"" to report transactions to the IRS, the same way your TD Ameritrade account let's the IRS know you sold $42,000 worth of Weight Watchers stock. This seems like an inevitability to me. They defined ""broker"" pretty loosely, though;

&gt;Language in the bill would require crypto brokers to report customer information to the Internal Revenue Service. More importantly, over the weekend it broadened the definition of what’s considered a “broker” to anyone “responsible for regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another person” which doesn’t exclude miners, software developers, stakers and other individuals in the crypto economy who don’t have customers.

It seems like, due to an outcry from Crypto lobbying groups, they intend to tighten up the definition of ""broker"" but that doesn't change the main goal here which is for Crypto transactions to be reported directly to the IRS.

They did not even invest 1k in ANYTHING.

Amber_Sam,"We all disregarded Bitcoin for some time, don't stress about it too much because we all are still way too early in this game, called adoption. Some additional info, in case you need it - a few answers to questions I had at the beginning. 

Congrats on the move, it's never too late. ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.

Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, nor next week. Statistically, it's less than four years from now. Anyone who bought Bitcoin at any point in the past and held it for 4+ years is in profit. 

**Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least first year**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to.

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for SATs. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://amber.app/calculate-your-investment/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference.

Now, don't buy a fake Bitcoin at etoro, RH, PayPal or similar, get the real thing. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin) 

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.

A few good wallet choices:

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for very small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix works on Android

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - Android or iOS

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[https://trezor.io/](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're.

[https://coldcardwallet.com/](https://coldcardwallet.com/) \- ColdCaard is currently the safest and most recommended here.

There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend as not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, etc. Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful.

Tricky_Troll,"I wasn't fucking joking when I told you all multiple times that the effect of EIP-1559 will be significant on ETH price. Most miners operate as a business and sell most or all of their ETH immediately to pay their operating expenses which thanks to a competitive market with razor thin margins, is most of their earnings. We just reduced their income by a double digit percentage. This means that we have effectively removed millions of dollars of daily selling pressure on ETH overnight. While I will concede that it is still early for me to claim with absolute certainty that my theory was correct since there are many forces at play in these markets, but just look at Bitcoin and what it does after its halvings. Every time without fail it goes on a huge parabolic run due to the dramatically reduced selling pressure from miners. ETH is no different.

In the coming months, we'll see just how much of an effect EIP-1559 will have had. Then, after that you can extrapolate what happened to ETH price post EIP-1559 which reduced miner income by ~20-30% and apply it to a 90% decrease. Seriously, people are still sleeping on the significance of the merge and ETH becoming ultra sound money. I don't care how knowledgeable you are my EthFinancier friends, you are sleeping on the significance of such a supply shock. I don't care how much I never shut up about this, but I too am sleeping on the effect of this. We are going from tens of millions of dollars per day in constant selling pressure to *net negative* ETH issuance. Even crazier, the first few months post-merge  will be effectively no issuance because stakers who receive the remaining 10% of current ETH issuance won't be able to sell it as withdrawals from the beacon chain will be activated at a later date. So with this, within a year from now we will be burning ETH to interact with DeFi and mint NFTs but nobody will be selling newly minted ETH. But someone has to sell you some ETH for you to buy back what you burned minting your superfluous cat JPEG. Well I can guarantee you you'll have to pay a pretty penny for such a scarce asset.

Obviously I don't have the resources to help all of them but I listen to their stories and many kids of parents who are actively being scammed write to me.

The largest sum of money lost was 500k worth of bitcoin (investment scam). And soooooo many love scams that have received 60k upwards from their victims.

The victims of the love scams are often older women who put their financial welbeeing as well as their (often in-tact) marriage on the line for the people they fell for.

Chance_Interaction35,"As the market pumps, I see I lot of sad people here saying that they should've bought more during the accumulation phase. However, how could we know that it would pump like this by August? Why if Bitcoin kept crabbing for the next three years? What if it went down even further? Of course, the answer seems easy now, but about one month ago it was not. The first mistake people make in crypto is, by far, investing a lot of money out of excitement, getting slapped in the face by a bear market, and selling at a much lower price in order to pay rent.  
  
Therefore, no, you should have not bought more. You should buy as much as you can, but always preserving your financial stability. If you did this, you are going the right way. Crypto is not about investing a lot, it's (and has always been) about investing wisely.

I just noticed this trend where ETH and BTC both roughly inflates by the equivalent of $40M/day but now ETH dropped to $26M/day. In the short term this is a fun little objective stat to give to maxis who insist burning doesn't matter because there's still no hard cap and inflation is bad.

SpontaneousDream,"About a year ago Yearn Finance ($YFI) went from ~$1,000 per coin to a high of over $40,000, at the time making one YFI worth more than one BTC. This left many investors puzzled at how it could suddenly and seemingly randomly fly up in price so fast. YFI would eventually hit an ATH of over $80,000 per coin during May 2021. 

How is this possible and how does it relate to Bitcoin? 

1. Scarcity. 

2. The effects of supply and demand on price. 

What people didn’t understand at the time, and in my opinion the primary reason for YFI’s massive price spike, was just how *scarce* it’s supply was (and still is). YFI’s supply is only **36,666** (originally it was 30,000 but they voted to increase it). That is ridiculously, insanely scarce. When you take into account basic laws of economics, it leads to an exponential price increase when there is enough demand. In this case, even just a small amount of demand (compared to BTC) was able to hugely increase the price. 

These exponential price increases (and exponential growth in general) are *difficult for human minds to comprehend. 

This is one reason why if you told someone years ago that one Bitcoin would eventually be worth ~$50,000 they would think you’re absolutely insane. They would not be able to understand how that’s possible. 

Bitcoin’s supply is of course many times greater than YFI’s, but compared to the supply of other traditional assets, Bitcoin’s supply is still *extremely* scarce. For this reason, I believe we are going to see 1 BTC reach future long term price levels that will seem utterly preposterous to us right now. Of course, demand still needs to grow, but all macro indicators continue to point to increased demand over time. I’m not going to list them all here, but I think most of you know at least a few. 

The point of this comment is to hopefully convince some here to step back and look at the big, long term bull case for Bitcoin. Of course it’s hard to take into account the sort of exponential growth that I mentioned above, but it’s still something to try to be aware of. Any smart investor knows that *time in the market beats timing the market*. 

I think anyone who is *patient* and determined to hold onto their Bitcoin for 5, 10, 20 years or more is going to see some pretty incredible price growth that will make traditional equities pale in comparison. I know this is a trading sub, and I trade a small amount of my stack, but I think you’d be pretty foolish to not have a long-term nest egg.

JosephWalrus,"Hal Finney's last post on the bitcoin talk forum, posted for context and continuation of legacy:

&amp;#x200B;

""I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.  
For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.  
Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.  
When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.  
I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.  
When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.  
Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.  
After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.  
The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.  
Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.  
My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.  
ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.  
Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.  
It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.  
And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.  
That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.""",h8ab3mt,2021-08-09 22:52:28,57

echoesreach,"Article Text:

The pro-Trump internet went wild on Wednesday for the Freedom Phone, a $500 smartphone that comes stocked with conservative apps and promises to liberate anyone else who buys it from Silicon Valley censorship. The American flag-branded phone was immediately promoted by a wide range of right-wing figures, including former Trump adviser Roger Stone, Jan. 6 rally organizer Ali Alexander, and pundit Dinesh D’Souza.

“I’m holding a freaking phone that is not controlled by Apple or Google,” conservative personality Candace Owens told her fans in an Instagram video. “We made the switch immediately.”

Despite being lauded by some of the right-wing media’s leading figures, though, the Freedom Phone’s buyers could be getting less than they expect for its $500 price tag. That’s because the Freedom Phone appears to be merely a more expensive rebranding of a budget Chinese phone available elsewhere for a fraction of the Freedom Phone’s price.

The Freedom Phone was created by Erik Finman, the self-proclaimed “youngest bitcoin millionaire” and one of Time Magazine’s “Most Influential Teens of 2014.” In a video announcing the phone, Finman said he was inspired to create the phone after the tech giants’ crackdown on both Donald Trump and conservative social media app Parler in the wake of the Jan. 6 riot.

“Imagine if Mark Zuckerberg censored MLK or Abraham Lincoln,” Finman said in the video.

Freedom Phone’s website is nearly totally devoid of technical information about the device. Finman declares in the promotional video that the Freedom Phone is “comparable to the best smartphones on the market” and “truly is the best phone in the world.”

In fact, Freedom Phone appears to be a simple rebranding of a budget phone called the “Umidigi A9 Pro,” made by the Chinese tech company Umidigi. In an interview with The Daily Beast, Finman confirmed that the Freedom Phone was manufactured by Umidigi, but couldn’t say immediately which Umidigi phone it was based on.

The Freedom Phone’s $500 price tag would represent a substantial markup on the Umidigi A9 Pro. That phone is available on Chinese retail giant AliExpress for $120 — less than one quarter of the price of a Freedom Phone.

Asked to justify the Freedom Phone’s notable price increase over the Umidigi model, Finman claimed vaguely that the Freedom Phone features customized hardware and improved memory. He committed Wednesday to publishing the phone’s technical specifications — basic details any company selling a phone should be able to provide. As of Thursday afternoon, however, no technical specifications had been provided to The Daily Beast or added to the Freedom Phone’s website.

In an interview, Finman claimed that the Freedom Phone is manufactured in Hong Kong.

“Nothing’s manufactured itself in mainland China,” Finman said.

According to Umidigi’s website, the tech manufacturer’s headquarters is located in Shenzhen, a mainland Chinese city near Hong Kong. Umidigi didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The Freedom Phone also comes preloaded with an array of free apps for social media networks Parler and MeWe, would-be YouTube competitor Rumble, and media networks One America News and Newsmax. Popular battle royale shooter Fortnite is also preinstalled on the Freedom Phone — a fact that confused more than one conservative influencer who promoted the product.

It’s not clear why a handful of free apps, all of which are currently available in the Google Play app store for other Android devices, would justify the price increase over the Umidigi. Even if the apps were ultimately banned from Google’s store in the future, users could still install them on non-Freedom Phone Android phones through a process called “sideloading.”

The vagaries of Freedom Phone’s actual specifications has produced some awkwardness among the Freedom Phone’s legions of conservative influencers. For example, the Freedom Phone’s “Freedom OS” operating system is based on Google’s Android operating system, according to Finman. But during a livestream video promoting the phone, right-wing activist Anna Khait was confused by her fans’ basic questions about the phone.

“Is it an Android?” Khait said. “I’m not really sure. No, it’s a Freedom Phone.”

While Freedom Phone’s founder has failed to include basic details about its device, he did line up a massive ad campaign among conservative influencers. Along with Owens, Stone, D’Souza, and Alexander, the Freedom Phone has also been backed by a number of other figures popular on the right, including Pizzagate conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec, journalist John Solomon, and Students for Trump cofounder Ryan Fournier.

Many of the Freedom Phone’s prominent endorsers urged their followers to use a promo code to buy the phone, suggesting that the influencers will receive a cut when their fans buy the phone.

Freedom Phone’s promotional campaign generated attention across Twitter, as conservatives promoted it and critics pointed out its potential technical shortfalls. Finman spoke to The Daily Beast from the Freedom Phone’s launch party, right as he realized the phone’s name had become a “trending topic” on Twitter.

“Oh shit, this is trending,” Finman said. “Wow.”",h8bob6h,2021-08-10 04:47:06,76

bitusher,"&gt;Satoshi Nakamoto was once in favor of creating a hard fork 

He never said this. Someone asked how we could possibly increase the blocksize later on and he simply gave an example of how this could be accomplished.

Satoshi didn't say if we should or when we should increase the blocksize or whether to do so with a soft fork or hard fork. 

Regardless , the bitcoin community changed the block limit Satoshi set to from 1MB blocks to 4 million units of weight in 2017 with a fork allowing blocks as large as 3.7MB in size for Bitcoin

&gt;If it had happened and the new currency was so popular and it replaced BTC wouldn't that have made Satoshi's allegedly mined 1M BTCs be worthless?

If you control your private keys you get both sides of the split with hard forks, so no. 

Also ...Satoshi having 1 million BTC is a myth created by sergio which was quickly shown to be flawed and contradictory.

and followup

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=178629.0

Where Greg and others point out flaws in his research and how some of it is self contradictory 

Here is Bitmex's follow up research on the matter - 

https://blog.bitmex.com/satoshis-1-million-bitcoin/

&gt;In conclusion, although there is strong evidence of a dominant miner in 2009, we think **the evidence is far less robust than many have assumed.** Although a picture is worth a thousand words, sometimes pictures can be a little misleading. Even if one is convinced, the evidence only supports the claim that the **dominant miner may have generated significantly less than a million bitcoin in our view. Perhaps 600,000 to 700,000 bitcoin** is a better estimate.

&gt;**None of the above says much about whether the dominant miner was Satoshi**, although we know Satoshi mined block 9, which we have allocated to the dominant miner in our analysis. **However this is in a slope of just 11 blocks, so it’s certainly not conclusive**. Whoever the dominant miner was, it is of course **possible the keys have been lost or discarded by now**.

Thus block 9 and genesis block was created by Satoshi 100%, and the evidence reflects he might have mined 11 blocks at least in addition to the genesis under these assumptions .

This means the evidence suggests we definitely know satoshi mined 2 blocks , and likely mined 11 blocks, and that **perhaps** there was a dominant miner who mined between 600-700k bitcoin(not blocks). **There are other explanations for the extranonce pattern that do not point to a dominant miner. Simply a similar software setup can cause this.**

Since there was over 3 days between the genesis block being mined and block 1 and difficulty was 1 it would be safer to assume satoshi waited for other miners to start mining before joining in .",h8crowo,2021-08-10 09:46:02,164

pmcolt,"The quiet woke him.  
  
Not the noise of tires and engines and honking traffic below his apartment window. Not the clamor of pedestrians. Not the brain-rattling report of jackhammers from the construction zone up the street.  
  
He sat up in bed, confused. The City that Never Sleeps was never silent.  
  
Confusion turned to panic when he checked the time. Mid-morning! Yet there was no city noise. No signs of life outside his window. Not even an angry text from his boss asking why he was two hours late for work.  
  
Outside his window he saw a line of cars, all motionless, as though this city street had been converted overnight into a parking lot. And slumped over each steering wheel, a peacefully slumbering driver.  
  
Was everyone in the neighborhood asleep?  
  
Grabbing his binoculars, and feeling a little sheepish, he peered into the windows of the apartments across the street.

Mr. Night Owl on the second floor had his windowblinds closed.

Nothing stirred inside the cluttered apartment of Angry Old Man on the third floor.

And on the fourth floor, Loud Blonde Sex was wrapped up peacefully in her satin sheets.  
  
He opened the Reddit app on his phone. Search. ""Is everyone asleep?"" Sort by newest. Somehow he found himself in /r/nosleep.  
  
There was one recent post, titled ""anyone else awake?"" Four comments.  
  
With a relieved chuckle, he tapped the post.  
  
""Is anyone else awake?!?! Post your location.......""  
  
It was posted by a new user, u/NotSleepingChick, one post. He scrolled down.  
  
First comment. u/NoSleepAutoBot ""It looks like there may be more to this comment. Click here to get a reminder to--""  
  
Second comment. ""Do you want too make $1.000s of dollars a week in BitCoin? Its easy with Cryptex Inc.'s proprietary fluctuation-prediction algorithm--""  
  
Bad bot. He clicked the link to report the post.  
  
Third comment. Bot.  
  
Fourth comment. Bot.  
  
He realized that the moderators must also be asleep.  
  
In desperation he posted ""I'm awake!"" with his city, street address, and apartment number.  
  
Then he started checking location-specific sites farther from his home city. East Coast. West Coast. Norway. South Africa. Southeast Asia. Northwest Territory. No news, no Reddit posts, no Youtube comments had been posted for hours. Traffic cameras showed city after city with no moving traffic, drivers blissfully asleep.  
  
His phone chimed: new notification! A tap, and Reddit opened.  
  
""PrivacyBot has detected what looks like a street address. As a reminder, for privacy reasons, you should never post personal--""  
  
So that was it. There was no sign of wakeful human activity anywhere in the city, the country, or the world. For all he knew, he was the last conscious man on the entire planet. Alone, alone, all all alone in a sea of slumberers.

Except... a human must have posted the original ""anyone else awake"" Reddit post. Right?  
  
The last man on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door.

It was genuinely fair (no pre mine) and the protocol functioned for years before it was ever traded for any fiat currency so effectively it had no price or even tie to the monetary system. 

This is the edge that dictates nothing can ever be like bitcoin.  Even if another coin did a fair launch (no premise for founders and VCs) anyone who entered would be doing so with the expectation of It’s appreciation in fiat price. You also have to consider the fact that hash power that is directed towards this new coin would be doing this at the expense of hashing on the bitcoin network. Thus it’s implied that those miners would be expecting significant return for their hashing. The bitcoin birth is genuinely impossible to replicate.

Merlin560,"PnF Update

[https://imgur.com/a/IphHIsX](https://imgur.com/a/IphHIsX)

Obviously the price turned overnight and we are currently building a downward column of Os.  If this surprised anyone, shame on you.

I want to point out what makes this “turn” significant—at least in my eye.

This column rose 30 boxes in seven days.  We have had 30 box columns before.  While that is good, it is not significant.  What is significant is that it took so long to move up 30 boxes.

It shows that while there remains volatility, it has not nearly as volatile as previous months during this past year.

It is not an official “metric” of point and figure charting but I keep track of how many columns we have in any given month.  Subsequently, I also keep a tally of how many days it takes to create a column (up or down.)  This gives me a sense of the “manic” nature of the market.

If you were to look at PnF charts for things like a boring bank stock, they are not that manic.  Take a look at TD Bank in this chart.  Its moved 3 columns this year.  Thats 80 days per column.

By comparison, bitcoin moves—(2021) a column every two days.

In the first 12 days of August, this is our third column.  Thats four (4)days, on average, for every column.  Since the first of the year the average is 2 days per column.   There has not been such a “slow moving” period this year.

So…are bitcoin traders on vacation?  Is it taking a well deserved breather?  Is it about to go bat-shit crazy?  Does it mean I should spend more time in my garden?   I have no idea.

When you are staring price movements over time and you get used to the “rhythm”, when that changes you notice.  You might not see what causes a change….but you know something is not “like it was.”

So here are today’s numbers:

1. Moved to a column of Os.
2. The formation is 2 columns wide.  A break back up might not be too explosive.
3. The current High Pole Warning target is at $42,136.
4. The price would rejoin the widest part of the previous formation down under $40,100.
5. Support is back at #38,145.  So, a little up and down around our current price would build some higher support.  **Right now this 30 box column looks as much like a cliff as it does the trail of a rocket.  Be careful when there is little support.**
6. A break down would at $37,393.
7. The price would need to rise up tomorrow to $47,010 to break out.  And resistance, starting tomorrow would be $46,086.

Keep an eye on stuff until this settles out a little.  I could see being a light short down to the $42,136 mark.  But I think this is probably a healthy pullback.",h8ooues,2021-08-13 03:28:29,62

Depending on the size of your portfolio, the mix of assets you own, your risk appetite, your age, your monthly cashflows relative to your portfolio size, your responsibilities and emotional maturity, it make total sense to allocate the said 0.5-20% towards crypto assets. This is not financial advice, this is just my personal opinion. What I want to mention in specific is that you do not need to buy a whole bitcoin but can buy fractions of it. Frequently it also makes sense to start a new investment with a small allocation and get a feel for it. Once you have skin in the game you usually dig much deeper for information than you usually do.

CalligrapherOneTwo3,"I have been involved in this alternative asset class for a few years now and I would highly recommend staying away from Wealthsimple because it is expensive and you will not own any crypto-assets with them as I will detail below. Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:  
  
1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montréal which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy.     
  
2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them ""offline"" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.  
  
3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy BTCX, ETHX or BTCC in your TFSA. With that said, you do not truly own crypto with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not the asset itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: ""not your keys, not your crypto"". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not insured. Big risk, but tax free/deferred in a TFSA/RRSP.  
  
4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold ""entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga"" while Quadriga held the ""keys"" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of ""not your keys, not your Bitcoin"" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.  
  
5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, ETHX, and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the ""keys"". They are the ones who own the real asset (crypto) and simply run the fund with the crypto backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).  
  
6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (crypto), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your ""adjusted cost base"" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your ""adjusted cost base"" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.  
  
7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency.   
  
Now, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:  
  
1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its ""blockchain"".  
  
2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a ""key"" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this ""key"" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word ""seed phrase"" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word ""seed phrase"" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word ""seed phrase"" is essentially your ""keys"" to your assets on the blockchain.  
  
3. Your 24-word ""seed phrase"" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word ""seed phrase"" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your ""keys"" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin.   
  
4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word ""seed phrase"" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word ""seed phrase"" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your ""keys"". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your ""keys"", never give it out. Period.

Unfortunately, there are hard limits to how far a single blockchain can scale. Currently, it already takes nearly a day to sync an Ethereum full node, and you need at least a 1 TB SSD. So, Ethereum is already pushing the limits of how far a blockchain can be pushed.

Now, you'll say that X, Y and Z blockchains have lower fees, and that is true. This is for two reasons a) they have much lower demand, or b) they have much higher system requirements. Over time, very few people will be able to afford to run these blockchains, and they'll become very centralized. Indeed, something like Solana is already de-facto centralized. Remember when I said it takes nearly a day to sync an Ethereum node? It's actually impossible to sync a Solana node, so the only way to do it is to get snapshots from centralized entities like Solana Labs. Now, there's nothing inherently wrong with this - it's just a completely different approach that shouldn't be compared to Ethereum.

Arbitrum One is a rollup chain, a separate chain built on top of Ethereum. Thanks to an array of clever innovations, it's possible for rollups to execute transactions off-chain, and then post back only the minimal data back to Ethereum in a compressed form. (See the Finematics link Papazio posted above for a brief explainer of how all of this is possible) This way, across all rollups we can squeeze 4,500 TPS out of Ethereum while at the same time keeping it decentralized and not increasing system requirements. More importantly, because all the data is on Ethereum itself, it's as secure as Ethereum. So, instead of severely compromising on security and decentralization as mentioned above, you get low fees and high security. In the future, Ethereum will release data sharding, which rollups can use to post their compressed data, and thus scale to 85,000 TPS, increasing to millions of TPS over the years. These are the type of scale that's simply impossible to achieve with traditional monolithic blockchains.

As for if Ethereum transactions cost $5,000, yes, Arbitrum transactions will then cost $50. But if that happens Ethereum will be burning $6 trillion in fees per year. After data shards release, this will be more like $120 trillion, which is literally more than the GDP of the entire world. I know some of us are bullish on Ethereum, but come on, there's no way we'll see this level of insane demand!",h90oedk,2021-08-15 20:07:33,41

Almost every Crypto out there is a store of value asset.  Even the ones that are designed to be a currency are not being used as a currency.  People hold these assets because they expect them to appreciate in value.  A medium of exchange coin is something that can easily be exchanged for fiat and is widely accepted by merchants.  Because Dogecoin is basically Bitcoin source code, it has a ton of development and acceptance basically built in.  They are basically saying Dogecoin isn't an investment its a currency.  Maybe there are objectively ""better"" currencies but I can't really think of anything that has anywhere near the adoption of Dogecoin.  XRP, NAno, sure they are great and have low fees but no one actually uses them as a currency.   Maybe instead of instantly hating Dogecoin we should be excited about any adoption of any Crypto?

Best I could do is maybe steal ideas and do them before anyone else does. but as a kid living in the middle of no where with zero connections, what can I really do.

I'd need at least a week of prep-work. I'd do the easiest thing by looking up big lottery pots with no winners that my mom could play. I'd look up at least 10 and study them. because we all know how parent are. They never listen to kids. Then i'd memorize the important bitcoin dates. At one point you could buy a whole bitcoin for like 10 cents or something. imagine doing that and just waiting until like 2017 or whatever one of the biggest peaks was.

Altruistic_Sound6730,"Alright, the price is down. I will give you a whale update, the REAL balance:

Two days ago I made an update. Back then the top 25 whales had 78,64 trillion. They had sold 0,5 trillion a day for 11 days.

Now two days later the whales are down to 74,72 trillion. Thats 2 trillion sold a day! Now they only hold 12,92 % of the circulating supply, down 0,67 % in just 2 days. Just think if Bitcoin whales sold 0,67% of all circulating coins in 2 days.

Now some things I have noticed these past two days:

- Mini whales (1000-200 billion) are also selling huge bags. That is not even counted in the above 2 trillion a day. Bonus info, I counted them and there are 81 mini whales.
- Yesterday I made a little update. Here I statet two things. My next update we would go under 25 whales, and behold now it is 24.
- Yesterday I also statet that our big old whale #1, would drop from #2, and behold he is now #3.

Lastly, look at chart. You see that we eat the dips but we mainly go down because of the whales (+mini) are selling.
The price hurts but if you believe in this coin and the team, then remember that whales selling now is better than later. Just contiue eating that dip. The big whales can't continue this fight and big dips forever.

Altruistic_Sound6730,"Extra edition, the REAL whale watch. This update is crazier than the last:


I was asked if I could do this daily or weekly. I replied that the whales do not sell to often for a daily (back then they sold 0.5 trillion a day). And here I am, making an update 11 hours since my last.

Right after my morning update the whales went on a rampage. That is the first dip you see on the picture, and they keept going. BUT look at us fighting back! I will come back to that but first some numbers:

- In just 11 hours the whales are down 4.75 trillion. And remember this is not counting mini whales. The whales ""only"" sold 4 trillion the 48 hours before that. Oh and the 11 days before that? 5.5 trillion. Now compare that with todays numbers..

- In these 11 hours the whales sold 0.82 % of the circulating supply. They ""only"" sold 0.67 % the 48 hours before that. I will repeat myself. How would Bitcoin or any other crypto look if whales sold near 1% off the supply in half a day? Or 1.5 % in 2.5 days?

- The cold hard facts: 24 whales with 1 trillion or more. They now hold 69.97 trillion. That is 12.10 % of the circulating supply. 


Now back to todays fight. Look at the picture again, see how many green jabs we hit away after the heavy red blows bye the whales. That  is beautiful. I saw Fudsters today writing that we are the only token that does not recover. Are we looking at the same picture? I sure think that looks like a fine recovery. As I statet in my last post, the whales can't keep doing this. 

To you dip eating, diamond handed Safemoon family. I salute you. 
Today will be a day we shall remember. We have shown our great devs that we believe in them and this token (soon to be coin). Now we keep fighting, because the whales still have some in them. But soon the devs will send us to the moon (if a dev should read this, please don't make me wrong).

My last remark. Don't hate the whales. Them selling now is better than later. They take profit and we can get some cheap Safemoon before the real takeoff. This is a chance for us little people. 
Maybe we some day will become a whale (not their size) and may sell. Or even better, live off the reflections. Not financial advice.

If so, how did he pay for it - Bitcoin (I have no idea how this works)? His personal CC (as he did with his AM account)? And why download it twice?  Once he downloaded it, he downloaded it. 

2. The articles that have come out in the past few days (discussing the additional un-related officers who were able to access Josh’s files) have discussed that Josh left his CSAM downloads on a file-sharing network/server.  Josh allowed his files to be shareable.   Why would he do this - stupidity, lack of understanding, desire to share? Are these networks specifically devoted to perverted/criminal material? 

3. If Josh purposely left CSAM on a file-sharing network which allowed multiple agents to independently download CSAM from Pest’s IP Address, then why is Pest not also being charged with Distribution or Intent to Distribute CSAM?

**Yes, Every single trade on an exchange is a taxable event!**

Now this has several implications. Day trading becomes tax nightmare because every transaction is a taxable event. So someone that daytrades or invests in altcoins may be forced to use specialized software or hire an accountant for thousands of dollars and someone that just makes an occasional purchase of Bitcoin and withdraws it has a much easier task of calculated any taxes especially if they don't make large purchases giving them an excuse to simply not report. Not the same if you are daytrading on exchanges , especially if you have made over 200 trades in a year.

Also there is a distinction between short term and long term capital gains taxes so its much wiser to not sell your BTC for at least 1 year so at worst you have to pay the much lower long term capital gains -

Look at this chart -

https://www.fool.com/investing/2021-capital-gains-tax-rates-and-how-to-minimize-t/
TL;DR - most people will need to pay 15% in the USA for selling BTC after a year.

**Buy Bitcoin , record the price you bought it for and the date in a spreadsheet and wait at least 1 year before selling it or taking profits so if you do decide to pay taxes on profits you are at least in the lower tax category of long term capital gains.**

Many people do not pay taxes when they spend BTC or sell it in person for cash but if you sell on any exchange like coinbase in the future , buy a car, boat, atv, house , land with Bitcoin , you better pay your taxes

Examples - 

**Example 1 legal**: Say you bought 10 BTC for 1k USD each and want to sell them over a year later. Those BTC are now worth 10k each so you have a realized profit of 90k USD, thus your taxable income is now 90k if you have no other income. This would means you are in the 15% tax bracket thus are subject to 13,500 USD in taxes on the profit - deductions and writeoffs. So lets say with your writeoffs and deductions you now have to pay 6.5k in taxes , leaving you with 83,500 USD to put a down payment on a home.

**Example 2 legal** - You have 10 BTC purchased or mined at 1k each when you received them. This is now worth 100k USD. You wait a year to sell them and never sell more than the amount where your total income exceeds 39,375 usd per year and than file your taxes where you pay none due to being in the first capital gains bracket **if you have no other sources of income as you state** . This will take several years or much longer(as btc continues to appreciate) to slowly sell off your bitcoin


**Example 3 technically illegal**  - You have 10 BTC purchased or mined at 1k each when you received them. This is now worth 100k USD. You decide to use your reported income from your occupation to buy a home and keep the BTC spending separate on other items. You slowly spend your BTC on amazon, plane trips, hotels, selling small amounts in person or in atms without ID , restaurants in a private manner(personal wallet that you control private keys and you have done the minimum to wash the BTC). Technically you need to report taxes on every tx , but since you are not day trading the exchange you bought the BTC from does not report you and it is unenforceable for the IRS to even know you are spending those BTC. Since you are not buying large items registered to your identity you are also not targeted as well.

Here are other ways people avoid taxes -

spend btc directly for non registered items –technically illegal if you don’t pay taxes but difficult to enforce

sell at 2 way atms without ID (coinatmradar.com) –technically illegal if you don’t pay taxes but difficult to enforce


sell p2p with others–technically illegal if you don’t pay taxes but difficult to enforce


sell on a DEX like BISQ–technically illegal if you don’t pay taxes but difficult to enforce


Sell the minimum in a country like the USA where you can get in the 0% long term cap gains rate - legal

Keep the btc as collateral and take on debt that is not taxable - legal

Gift bitcoin with a gift tax exemption - legal

Donate bitcoin to charities - legal


For countries like the USA you can use any accounting method as long as you are consistent

If you were to use FIFO(first in , first out) it would look like this

Buy 1- 0.12 BTC @ 1000 USD

Buy 2 - 0.5 BTC @ 3540 USD

Buy 3 - 0.025 @ 4512 USD

Buy 4 - 0.0054 @ 8004 USD

Say you decide to sell 0.5 BTC for fiat(USD) when Bitcoin is valued at 40k usd
This would mean you would take your first in 2 purchases

0.12x40k = 4,800 usd in value - 120 initial purchase price = 4680 in profit

0.38 btc x 40k = 15,200 - original purchase rate of 0.38 (1345.2) = 13,854.2 profit

Total taxable profit = 18,534.8 usd

If its over a year , you are looking at the lower long term cap gains ... most people this would be 15% so you pay 2,780.22 usd in taxes if you decide to pay them
If under a year you will have the much higher ordinary tax rate (22-40% for most people)",h9anmt8,2021-08-17 23:44:33,69
New_Dawn,"I would imagine the point they're making is that *in a  Bitcoin hegemonic world* the opportunity for war is less because governments won't be able to so easily print fiat to fund their wars in the first place.

Also in a world of decentralized cloud finance, you could more easily pick up where you left off versus centralized banks just collapsing with all of your savings gone in an instant.

ArticMine,"The really interesting development I see  here is the upcoming Taproot upgrade to Bitcoin. 

&gt; Without Taproot, anyone can detect transactions that use those complex functionalities, which require the creation of multiple transactions. However, the Taproot upgrade will make it possible to ""cloak"" all the moving parts of a Bitcoin transaction that includes these features. So even if the transactions adopt those features, they will look like a single transaction. This is a big win for Bitcoin privacy advocates.

&gt; In fact, Taproot makes it possible to hide the fact that a Bitcoin script ran at all. For example, spending Bitcoin using Taproot could make a transaction in a Lightning Network channel, a peer-to-peer transaction, or a sophisticated smart contract become indistinguishable. Anyone monitoring one of these transactions would see nothing but a peer-to-peer transaction. It's worth noting, though, that this doesn't change the fact that the wallets of the initial sender and final recipient will be exposed.

https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-taproot-and-how-it-will-benefit-bitcoin

The implication here is that it is not possible to tell on the Bitcoin side  that an atomic swap with Monero actually took place. So while Taproot by itself will not make Bitcoin private, Taproot when combined with Monero atomic swaps can throw a real monkey wrench into blockchain surveillance on the Bitcoin blockchain. 

If a significant number of Bitcoin transactions could potentially be an atomic swap with Monero, the days of Bitcoin as a ""surveillance coin"" could very well be numbered. As chess players understand 

&gt; The threat is stronger than its execution",h9bncsh,2021-08-18 04:23:31,45
GlockAndLoad,"Today I decided to spend some time driving around to some of the businesses listed on the Spedn application.

I first stopped at Lowe’s. I picked out a nice little succulent plant that was $10. Approached the cashier and explained to her that I was testing the Spedn application to pay with Bitcoin. She had no idea that Lowe’s was even accepting Flexa/cryptocurrency and she thought it was a cool concept. She was a good sport and scanned my phone a few times as the register denied the request. She  manually inputted the code on the bottom of the screen and no dice. I showed her the message on the app that said “advise the cashier to use ePay”. We both could not figure out how to access that function on the point of sale and I just used my debit card. Could be that their location is not equipped or enrolled in the program so I got back on the road.

Next I end up at Baskin Robbins. I tell the cashier I intend to pay with Flexa/crypto and she is also very excited. I pull up the QR code and she scans it. Transaction goes through instantly and we both smile. She was very interested to learn more and I elaborated a bit about Amp and Flexa. Overall a positive and tasty experience.

Finally, I decide to make my way to Office Depot. I could use some extra pens, so I make my way to the register with some Pilot G2s and my QR code at the ready. This time I’m dealing with a 30ish year old guy and he seems to be just as interested in the Flexa concept as I am. We scan the code and the register says “this code/request cannot be completed”. We try a manual input of the code under the QR image and different types of payment/gift card methods. No dice. So I pay with my debit card instead.

Overall, I had a good experience when it worked at Baskin Robbins. None of the employees had ever heard of Flexa/Amp or even knew that it was possible with their brands. I plan on driving to other locations in the future to see if their registers are more up to date. I want to do my part to grow this network/community/concept so I’ll keep you all updated with my experiences. 

Would love to hear from you all about your part own experiences and real world testing.

Doppelgangergang,"**What is it?**



Bitcoin Lottery Mining is when you take hopelessly outdated miners and then have them mine ""solo"" against the network. Every miner has the random chance to create a ""winning block"" and be awarded Bitcoins. However, the slower and outdated a miner is, the less likely they will be able to find the right combination to ""win"" a block before someone else does.



**What's in the photo?**




- A Raspberry Pi Zero W running Raspbian and CGMiner
- A 7-Port USB Hub (Modified)
- Six USB Block Eruptors (333MH/s)
- A 12V to 5V DC-DC converter.

A webcam was added later.



**Modified USB Hub?**



The power rails were reinforced with added capacitors and I stuck thick wire on the rails to allow them to carry more amperage. I found the miners drop out sometimes without it.



**Cool, how much is it pulling in?**



It has been running for over 40 days, and has mined zero coins. It is a hopeless endeavour and mathematically likely will not be able to mine a single coin as long as I live. I think. Of course there's still the sub-atomically small chance...



**Can you mine other coins?**

Nope. Only SHA-256 based coins can be mined by this. I do have another Lottery Miner mining Litecoin+Dogecoin however.



**Can I see it in action?**

Okay, I stuck a webcam on it. [Here it is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPaJ37ZaYgQ)",h9d9cq2,2021-08-18 11:59:33,313

This community's ruthless search for decentralization and solutions is what will empower people all over the world.  
  
In bitcoin land you simply aren't allowed to criticize anything about lightning, Satoshi or anything related to the chain. You will be downvoted and muted because you don't understand the ""multilayer future"" or whatever.  
  
As an example [I openly critized Optimism](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/otqvqc/daily_general_discussion_july_29_2021/h6y1ckx?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and got upvoted for it. Optimism is a much loved Ethereum-aligned project with praise from several core devs. Looking back that rant was probably a bit heavy handed, but nevertheless people were not afraid to voice their opinion that problems were not being solved at the rate we wanted. Even if that means criticizing something we also love. That sentiment is so important and ensures we continue to improve Ethereum and empower people.

Liberosist,"Astute observation. Ethereum will have competition when something totally new and innovative comes along that supersedes Ethereum's long-term vision. Of course, Ethereum will have several years to respond, as network effects take years to unravel. Ethereum found success because it differentiated itself from and superseded ""Bitcoin killers"". Bitcoin had the opportunity to respond, but they botched it, and years down the line they will be flipped by Ethereum. 

The problem with ""Ethereum killers"" is they are perpetually behind, and looking to kill yesterday's Ethereum. Cardano, Solana and EOS are going for 2015-era single-ledger Ethereum bolstered by state channels and centralized relayers. By the way, it's interesting that over time these single-ledger protocols have become increasingly desperate and relying purely on ever greater brute force. Cardano's 2 MB block goals seemed reckless, EOS' 21 validators were highly centralized, Solana requiring you to run high power servers, and now we have ICP who require such exotic hardware that you can only purchase it from them! What this should tell you that Ethereum won the decentralized blockchain market a long time ago, and as time goes on newer players are increasingly distancing them from Ethereum. 

Cosmos and Avalanche are going for 2017-era Ethereum bolstered by sidechains and plasma. Polkadot and NEAR are going for 2019-era Ethereum with sharding. We're in 2021, and Ethereum has moved on to a rollup-centric vision. Can you name a single L1 other than Ethereum that rollups are deploying on? Or a single L1 other than Ethereum that is focused on expanding data availability for rollups? 

You'll note the big difference here is that all of those earlier visions have failed. Rollups are the only one that's working because they are being deployed in production.   
So, what I'm looking for in an actual Ethereum competitor is something that supersedes rollups and data shards, just like rollups made sharding obsolete, and sharding made sidechains obsolete, and sidechains/plasma made state channels obsolete. Given prior history, though, it's most likely that only Ethereum can come up with a model that supersedes rollups + data shards, though I'd argue that rollups + data shards are finally ""good enough"".",h9en8y8,2021-08-18 22:24:49,52

well, you're lucky, because I have evidence that the ETH supply is basically as well distributed as the BTC supply: https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb

&gt;Maximalists love to say ETH is more centralized than BTC and that the ICO is a “70% premine”
But, what does Bitcoin’s distribution look like when we compare it to ETH directly?

&gt;Bitcoin’s Top 10k Holders: 10.54M BTC (57.44%)

&gt;Ethereum’s Top 10k Holders: 57.2M ETH (56.70%)

&gt;Based on individual holders, Ethereum is as equally distributed as Bitcoin.",h9h4v2n,2021-08-19 09:48:13,61
troyboltonislife,"Sure. 

“Over 70% of Eth was premined”: Okay at the time that was 5 million dollars. Since then the Eth foundation has sold a large majority of it to pay for development. Also how much Bitcoin do the early adopters of Bitcoin have compared to the Eth foundation? Satoshi still holds 5% of bitcoin and we don’t even know who he is. He almost certainly owns more as well considering he hasn’t even touched the Bitcoin we do know about. 

“Nobody knows how much Eth exists”: This isn’t true. Anyone can run scripts to calculate the amount of total Eth. It’s possible to do. Is it harder than bitcoin? Yes. Because Bitcoin has a simple command anyone can run to check total bitcoin while Ethereum doesn’t. That still doesn’t mean it’s impossible to do. It’s just harder. 

“Scaling issues…”: Unlike bitcoin, Eth founders have acknowledged scaling issues and have been working on the problem since inception. This is basically a solved problem. Layer 2s make it much much cheaper and Eth 2 will make it even more cheap. Has it been a slow process? Sure but in a year from now anyone complaining about fees because they’re not on a layer 2 will look like an idiot. Fees will be a moot point. 

“Transaction failures”: This has been fixed with EIP-1559 which went through in the London fork. 

“Dex’s are broken”: This is a valid critique of Dex’s but compare total amount you pay on a Cex to total amount you pay on a Dex and you will quickly see that because of fees Cex’s are still much more expensive even with Dex front running. Dex’s can be much more capitally efficient and your usually paying market makers about the same you pay to front runners + LPs. 

“Ethereum is bloated”: This is a problem that’s being worked on. State expiry is the next on the list after the merge to POS. Also saying “amazing infrastructure built out for Eth is a bad thing” is incredibly naive. It isn’t impossible to not use 3rd party block explorers but why bother? As long as you can do it yourself as a backup and can confirm that a centralized third party is giving you correct info then I don’t see a problem. 

“Ethereum is so broken they are abandoning”: I shouldn’t even have to address this. Upgrading ethereum is being spun as a bad thing? The craziest thing is that all currently planned upgrades have all been planned *since Ethereums creation*. If it was in the plans from the start I wouldn’t consider this abandoning.

GoTheFckBack,"&gt; 70% premine

only 10% or so was ""given"" to the Ethereum foundation, the rest was distributed to retail investors who bought the ICO. that is literally no different to people buying bitcoin early and complaining its centralized because they have more than you

&gt; how much ethereum exists

literal nonsense, its a public blockchain you can see for yourself

&gt; cant scale

no blockchain can scale at L1 and maintain decentralization at this time. this isn't an Ethereum problem its the technology as a whole. L2s are launching this month and sharding will be here after the merge which will drop gas fees significantly

&gt; lost the fee on failed transactions

trying to make it sound like if you want to send ETH and you dont put a high enough fee you lose your ETH. Anyone who has actually used ethereum knows this is false. only time a fee is lost if the gas limit isnt high enough on a smart contract which is a user problem. the computation takes place you cant just refund someones fee on a failed smart contract because that would allow anyone to spam and ddos the network for no cost. this also has nothing to do with the actual cost of gas (setting that too low wont cause you to lose transactions). 

&gt; miners reordering

MEV is a problem with all blockchains

&gt; bloated

a full node is under 400GB the last time I checked. most situations can rely on the thousands of full nodes available. archive nodes are needed for specific dapps that require full state history and with Geth those have high storage requirements. erigon is trying to resolve this problem, currently an archive node on erigon is 1.4TB and can be easily run on your own device... definitely not centralized

It is processed as a purchase by your bank as opposed to an actual cash advance or withrawal, so the limit is only up to your daily purchase maximum. Also, get the casino's player card beforehand and present it before making your POS cash advance, because this way in addition to receiving a your cash, the casino will grant you a certain amount of points per ""dollar spent"", and since the transaction is technically a purchase, you will receive a metric fucking ton of player points, resulting in things like free comp nights in penthouses, free dining, free play, etc., and you can just give whoever you want your account information to book rooms with if you're not interested in enjoying them personally if the hotel is the type that has ""Mobile Check-In'. 

Once cash is aquired, pay off your balance \*over the phone\* with stolen account and routing numbers (obtained from account statements or checks found anywhere there are mailboxes). But, in the interest of  karmic debt, only use very rich people's accounts or large businesses, ideally a corporation. There is no point in fucking over some poor old lady who will struggle from the setback, and this average joe type will notice the charges immediately and fuck up the plan.

After the payment has posted and your balance has been replenished, rinse and repeat.

It's because all the other more serious crypto projects have heavily invested whales that got there before Elon. If he invests in any of those projects, he's effectively been front-run by someone that got in earlier and is better positioned to cash out. Elon is not going to risk his money on someone who can and probably will dump on him. 

So he found Doge which, once upon a time, was just a sort of funny joke and which, is not really funny any more.  He bought a whole bunch before the run up and basically cornered the market. He is in early enough that those cashing out really can't dump on him. 

The worst part is the other billionaires basically trying to help him pump. There are plenty of other more worthy projects that could use and deserve their help and attention.

Is there an annual dividend currently and if so what day do we receive dividend and what's the dividend yield exactly? What percentage of earnings are retained? I can't find anything about this so I'm guessing there's not a dividend yet but it doesn't hurt to check.

Mining seems like a pretty cool idea but I try to understand and I can't get a clear answer, what's the product that all the miners are producing? Who is buying this product and what is our profit margin on this product exactly? Or are these datacenters like Facebook, where the end-product is free and we just earn money through advertisements? Honestly I should have done more research, but how does the company earn money exactly? How much money are we spending on this mining thing exactly? Does management have a plan to reduce our expenses there, or are they going up?

Is the Bitcoin company currently making a profit or are we still in negative earnings territory right now? Is revenue growing? What's the price to sales ratio? What's the EV/EBITDA compared to the competitors? Do we have a lower EV/EBITDA than these Ethereum guys? What's our debt to equity ratio?

Has anyone figured out yet what the insiders are doing? Is management buying or selling? Who is the CEO of Bitcoin exactly? Is it this guy Paolo I saw on the news or is the Tether company separate from the Bitcoin company? How is the relationship exactly anyway, is Tether a subsidiary of Bitcoin?

So if you are trying to offload ~$1000 worth of Pendle, well there's only $220 worth of buyers close to the market price.   You'll have to dive down through the order book selling for $0.92, then $0.88, then $0.85 until you finally find enough buyers to sell all 1000 Pendle.

And **that's** on the actual Exchange where Buyers are matched with Sellers.  You are trying to go through the App.    With the App you are making an agreement with CDC which then later CDC will need to settle themselves.   That's why Crypto.com will only offer you e.g. $0.75 for each Pendle, because now THEY are the ones that need to go onto an exchange to offload it.   Something with high liquidity like Bitcoin isn't a problem, there will surely be buyers waiting so they'd only charge like a 1% spread, but for something like Pendle it's even more of a risk, so more of a spread.  (In addition to the thin order book so the $0.964 price might be the price for 1 Pendle, but not for 1000 Pendle.)",h9ryvuc,2021-08-21 20:08:44,161

BTCMachineElf,"Bitcoin is the only true decentralized coin without any governing authority. Any alts that claim to be ""better tech"" are sacrificing decentralization, no matter what they claim.

Satoshi was able to solve the ""Byzantine Generals' Problem"" which made Bitcoin the first true cryptocurrency. He created this not for selfish reasons, but as a gift to the world. He ensured that the rollout was as fair as possible and did not cash out on his invention.

Bitcoin is and has always been open source. It is truly a grassroots movement and a symbol of humanity rising up against oppression. Since inception, bitcoin has been developed by a huge network of brilliant coders. It doesn't have extraneous features of alts because the focus is on creating the most secure, hardest money known to man without sacrificing any decentralization. It exactly what it needs to be, and still is being upgraded.

Because of it's immaculate conception and cutting edge technology, bitcoin has general consensus as being the most desirable cryptocurrency. Because the social contract is vital to the function of money, that consensus is an feedback loop that if were somehow broken, would damage the credibility of *all* crypto as potential long term stores of value.

Bitcoin was the first, but bitcoin is also the best. Bitcoin is fair. Bitcoin is decentralized. Bitcoin is a technical marvel. Bitcoin has general consensus as *the* store of value.

Well, let me burst some bubbles of people in here. The reality is that the infrastructure isn't there at all. We only have 3 bitcoin ATMs installed in the whole country (as far as I'm concerned) and businesses don't have clear regulations on how Btc needs to be accepted and handled,and we are only 3 weeks away from this to take place! 

Our Central Bank published this week a ""regulation"" document in which basically said to all banks operating that they are on their own on how to accept it. 

The government has failed in teaching our people about crypto and btc, there hasn't been an effort in marketing or educating people about it and it can be felt that people are confused and the majority don't want to accept Btc because of this. You can search for polls and you will see that over 70% of people have a negative view on the whole bitcoin law. 

The whole thing has been a PR stunt that yeah, functioned to impress the crypto community, but has the potential to cause more harm than good because of the incompetence the government has shown.

r13k,"Hi, I'm not saying this is just another rant or just another ""Cardano is overhyped post"" ... But yes.. It sounds more like a well studied rant. Let me explain why I think that -

Every community have Maxis, that doesn't make Charles fraud or something..
Charles never said go buy Ada, he never said we'll quickly provide solution to all the problems, he said it would take time, that doesn't mean a project is a scam. I mean come on! Ethereum is a scam in the eyes of Bitcoin Maxis.
Why do you think no one will use Cardano? At one point eth used to be the same, in development, without smart contact, or ""famous"" smart contracts, your argument sound more like a Bitcoin maxi rant from few years back arguing about ""Why eth is scam"".
Many other projects are doing great yes! And still eth is preferred even with all that blotted network, do we call eth hyped? No... A $50 transfer asks for $30 in fees, and when this is mentioned, eth lovers will says ""this is what you py for future technology in early stage"" but the issue is there right, saying this is like having faith.. That eth2.0 is ""Going to solve all the problems"".. But it is not here yet, but you still believe it, based on your understanding of the project, the same way people believe that when Smart Contracts are there on Cardano, it can be amazing, is it bad to think that? 
When buying Coins n tokens people can choose sides.. But when it comes to paying for transactions, people want cheapest option available, if Cardano or any other project provide that along with security, scalability don't you think people wants to use it?
Charles never said he wants to kill eth or something. We all are hoping for a interoperability future.

Btw eth also fell bad in 2017 even with all the smart contracts etc, and it fell from high in may to $1600 this june.. That doesn't mean people have discarded eth. Same way $1 to $0.03 for a project that yet to deliver smart contract is fair... You also needs to understand the way Stock market works too. Many companies with promising future but yet to deliver are also bought for high, takes time to mature, capture market, bearing losses and then they rise. And when that happens, all the investment is paid off. It's a long game.
Nokia was once a leader in Mobiles, that doesn't mean people didn't migrated to Android from Symbian.

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful.

Malumeze86,"Article text:

When China Guangfa Bank Co successfully applied to freeze $20 million in bank deposits and assets associated with China Evergrande, it was big news in the boardrooms, offices and around the water coolers at major financial institutions globally.

At face value this may seem strange – $20 million is just a drop in the ocean for one of the world’s biggest property developers. However, for months concern had been mounting about Evergrande’s spiralling debts.

That decision made by a court in China’s Jiangsu province was handed down in July 2021 and the matter (involving money owed by an Evergrande subsidiary) was resolved just days later. But since, Evergrande’s astronomical debt burden has continued to unravel and many fear the ripple effects could spread globally. Some have even suggest it could be the catalyst for another subprime-style crisis.

**Who is China Evergrande?**

China Evergrande cranes dominate the skylines of many Chinese cities. The company develops and manages real estate across China, primarily focussing on residential apartment complexes. According to the company website, Evergrande Real Estate owns more than 1300 projects in over 280 Chinese cities.

It is the second-largest property developer in China and ranks amongst the top 150 companies in the world based on revenue. According to Fortune 500, the company has over 123,000 employees, and posted total revenues of $73.5 billion in 2020.

Alongside its enormous property development and management operations, Evergrande has also made investments into other sectors such as electric vehicles, internet and healthcare businesses.

The company was founded by billionaire businessman Xu Jiayin in 1996. He is ranked by Forbes as the third-richest person in China and the 31st richest man in the world.

Xu Jiayin, 62, announced his resignation as Chairman of Evergrande Real Estate Group on Tuesday, August 17 2021.



**Sinking ship?**

 Xu Jiayin, the founder of China Evergrande, resigned from his role as Chairman of Evergrande’s Real Estate Group.
Evergrande is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange (HKG: 3333). Since July 2020, its share price has plunged around 80%.

China Evergrande’s debt crisis
There’s speculation of more than $356 billion of global debt exposure to China Evergrande.

The company is the largest issuer of US dollar denominated Chinese junk bonds – bonds that very few investors now want to touch.

As Hilliard MacBeth, author of When the Bubble Bursts, puts it on the Richardson Wealth blog:

“Evergrande bonds which had been trading at par, and maturing in 2025, are now trading below 40 cents.

“This implies a return of more than 2.5 times in just 4 years, plus a 10.5 percent coupon, which means that the market believes there is little chance that Evergrande can pay this debt.”

Asia Markets notes the yield to maturity on Evergrande bonds maturing in 2023 is now hovering at around 35% – an huge yield, implying a risk level unacceptable by most investors.

Rapid debt-fuelled expansion is widely attributed as the main reason China Evergrande finds itself is a such a perilous position today.

“They did it (growth) in such crazy mass, with lots and lots of debt,” explained macro strategist Tyler Neville on the On The Margin podcast.

Since the China Guangfa Bank Co court proceedings were made public in July, there has been a series of further concerning developments.

Just days later, an avalanche of law suits were initiated by Evergrande suppliers for alleged unpaid bills. Those include Huaibei Mining Holdings Co, which took court action over an alleged unpaid bill of $84 million, an unnamed investment company that won a court order to freeze Evergrande’s 20% stake in Shanghai-listed Langfang Development Co, and advertising company, Leo Group, which claimed it was owed around $61.5 million.

Further, Lanzhou City overnment officials have publicly revealed the city is owed money for land.

The extend of the debt problems has, not surprising, prompted ratings agencies to take action.

On Thursday, August 5, S&amp;P downgraded the company’s credit rating from B- to CCC (two levels), while also lowering the long-term rating on U.S. dollar notes issued by Evergrande from CCC+ to CC-.

“Evergrande’s liquidity position is eroding more quickly and by more than we previously expected,” said S&amp;P.

“The company’s non-payment risk is escalating, not only for the substantial public bond maturities in 2022, but also for its bank and trust loans and other debt liabilities over the next 12 months.”

Other major ratings agencies, including Moodys and Fitch, have also posted similar credit rating downgrades.

**Survival**

While investors have long debated the presence of a Chinese property bubble, bubble speculators may be vindicated should Evergrande completely collapse… And global market bears too.

While it’s in Beijing’s best interest to try mitigate a catastrophe, the administration has stopped well short of indicating a bail-out may be on the table – this a continuation of a more cautious policy approach to debt that’s been a trademark of the China Government in recent years.

On Thursday August 19, The People’s Bank of China and China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission took the unusual step of publicly urging Evergrande to take action to reduce its debt risk. It followed a meeting with company executives.

“Evergrande, as a top real estate company, must earnestly implement strategic arrangements made by the central government to ensure the stable and healthy development of the real estate market, and strive to keep operations stable,” the public statement read.

The statement went on to urge Evergrande to “actively diffuse debt risk and maintain real estate and financial markets stability.”

24 hours later, Evergrande management responded saying it would “fully implement” Beijing’s requirements, including reducing its debt risks and maintaining market stability.

There has been some progress on that front in recent days.

China Evergrande has confirmed reports that it’s in talks with smart phone manufacturer Xiaomi to sell a stake in its EV business, while negotiations with major creditors to extend loans have been successful. But the scale of the debt runs deep and much more will need to be done to avoid what many fear is the greatest threat to global markets.

**China’s Lehman Brothers?**

The collapse of world’s most indebted property developer could have an enormous impact on global investment markets.

David Llewellyn-Smith, co-author of The Great Crash of 2008 (currently a strategist at renowned Australian Investment Manager, Nucleus Wealth), is watching the devolvements closely and believes the significance of what’s occurring should not be lost on investors.

“Evergrande was once China’s greatest property developer. It is now an unbelievably over-leveraged tottering edifice with fewer and fewer friends and a near-impossible equity value below 10% of its debt load,” he wrote in Australian publication, Livewire.

Llewellyn-Smith also highlights something many industry insiders have long suspected – that the stable coin Tether is exposed to Evergrande’s commercial paper.

“This $300 billion debt monster is potentially China’s Lehmann Brothers, trading in subterranean junk debt to Chinese (and global) counterparties (which may include Bitcoin via Tether) at spreads that imply insolvency. There is no realistic scenario for restructuring Evergrande in which market dislocation is avoided. It is only about how much pain the Chinese government can bear.

“And there is a conga-line of Evergrandes queuing up in the property sector.”

Tyler Neville made a similar comparison noting: “If they’re borrowing money from the commercial paper market and doing all these funky things then this is sub-prime on steroids.”

“There’s probably a lot of other exposure… you could be looking upwards of a trillion or a couple trillion dollars.

Hilliard MacBeth further points out the baking sector “contagion” that could emerge.

“So far, Evergrande’s financial problems have not impacted other large developers or the Chinese banks. The largest Chinese developer, Country Gardens, is still trading near its all-time high,” he says.

“But aggressive price cuts on home pre-sales by Evergrande pushed home prices back to 2016 levels. Land costs have risen substantially, so profit margins are eroding. This could impact all developers, as buyers wait for price reductions before buying.

“The largest banks in the world are Chinese, with six of the top 11… The exposure of Chinese banks to Chinese real estate developers is enormous. About half of the assets (loans) held by the top ten banks are in China, about $15 trillion.”

Diatery,"If you dont intend to sell it right away, and I recommend you dont for at least 5 years as a boom is coming, and he didnt leave you a hardware wallet, here's what you do:

1. Watch a video on youtube explaining how hardware wallets work. I like a brand called Nano S Ledger. Another popular is Trezor.  If what you see in the video seems like something you can do on your own, purchase one *directly* from the official store. Never buy a used one.  Also recommend buying a disaster proof bag, as in water and fire proof. These are cheap on Amazon.

2. When you get it, install it on a PC that has current antivirus software or a trial version of Malware Bytes. Run all your updates.

3. Run the setup and write down the password phrases on the papers that come with your device.

4. Follow the instructions you saw on youtube to send a very small amount of bitcoin to your wallet only, as a test.

5. Shut down the pc and start over, except this time, try to recover your wallet. This is an important step to confirm your seed phrase is written correctly and the money is there.

6. Repeat this until the full amount is in there, and then take steps to weather and tamper protect this wallet. The seed phrase is more important than the device. Some people buy metal plates to etch them, as weatherproofing is very important.

If this is too much to do, alternatively you can:

1. Keep Bitcoin where it is, on an exchange or usb key etc.  If the security is tied to a phone number, this is dangerous. Change that to Google Autheticator or Authy (app) and write down your 2fa backup code in a safe place.  This is less secure but most people use this method as its the best for beginners.

The rise last night moved us to a High Pole Warning position.  This happens when the price moves four boxes above the break out point.

The high pole warning reversal target starts out at $47,010.  A drop that that point would not be horrific, and it would be healthy.

A reversal, and then a swing back up to another break out would complete the formation of a “bullish catapult.”   (I don’t make the names, I just report them.). This formation is the most bullish formation in PNF Charting.

Here are the numbers:

1.  The formation is 7 columns wide.  This is not a “big” formation for Bitcoin.  But…we are in a world that has moved mining from China to other places so the entire market space may be evolving.

2. We are in a triple Tip break out (which is very positive) and last night we triggered a high pole warning.  A reversal can be expected—back down to the 47,010 price target.

3. The price target for this move is based on the width of the formation.  That price hits $51,414 over the next 10-20 days.  The second price target, based on the size of the last breakout has already been met.

4. The current Trend Line is at $33,517.  We are 41 boxes above the trend line.  

This is a good move and it predicts some decent gains over the coming weeks.  But expect a pull back.  Be prepared to see it go down under $47,000—although that would probably be a brief visit.",ha18wsz,2021-08-23 23:12:53,88

`I used to do the same thing, look on https://www.teen-chat.org . That place is a complete cesspool for pedos, and I'll tell you exactly how I used to do it securely.`  
  
`Get good security: Set up a proxy, connect to a VPN that doesn't keep logs (IPVanish, Tunnelbear, NOT NORDPVN)`  
`Set up a new skype account that isn't connected to you at all, this means new email as well. Do all of this with your security on.`  
`Download a pack of images/videos, I use https://nulled.to , I'm a member on there, as soon as you register to go leaks, and then thothub. They have a lot of pics to use for profile pictures, selfies, etc.`  
`On the teen chatroom, say something like ""hey, any older guys on?"". You will get flooded with PMs. on the website, with one message in the chatroom you can easily get 20 people messaging you privately. Chat with them for a bit, and get their age, and say you're 15 or 16. Those ages are the most effective.`  
`Make sure to seem legit to them, they know police are looking for people like them, and they will want proof you're a real girl in some way, use your social engineering skills for this.`  
`Once you know they are pedos, you tell them to add you on skype and say this: ""hey how about we talk on skype and maybe trade?"" something like that.`  
`Try to talk to just one person at a time on skype, because if you take too long to reply they'll suspect you.`  
`Once you've got them on skype, say ""ok want to trade pics?"". If they do say yes which they likely will, use the pics you got from the pack in step 3.`  
`Once you have their dick pics and you've traded a few pics, say exactly this when you're about to trade again: ""Hey skype is giving me an error when I try to send you the pic, can you send me your email and I'll send you the pic there? We can still chat here, its just the pic.""`  
`If they do send you their email, you've got them unless they have a throwaway, which we'll get to in step 14.`  
`Google their email, they will probably have facebook. Make a fake facebook account to see their profile, note down the names of their family and employer, as well as their city. As much personal info as possible.`  
`Here is where you make your money. You can say this however you want, but I usually say something like this: ""Alright (name), is this you? (facebook link). I'm going to send the chat logs we just had to all of your facebook friends if you don't send me $100 in bitcoin or gift cards within the next 30 minutes. Do you want (family member name) to know about what you say to 16 year old girls online? I didn't think so. If you need help getting bitcoin, tell me and I'll help you buy some. Be quick.""`  
`Ok that's it really, they'll pay you most of the time. If not you can report them or whatever you want to do, I like sending letters to their employer mentioning their name to scare them into paying you. Make sure not to leave fingerprints if you do that.`  
`Now, if they do have a throwaway, you can try to threaten them with police instead, or send a ip grabber to their email that leads to nudes and say you keep your pics on there because your laptop has low storage. You'll have to think about this part, be creative, just scare them however you want. If you do get their IP, you'll have their city which might be scary enough, you can find what the police force is called in their area and say you'll contact them`  
`Enjoy your money! If they paid with crypto, pretty easy to cash out, I'd prefer buying digital stuff with it instead of cashing it out, its a bit safer but you should be ok either way, a pedo will most likely not report you for taking $100 when you have proof of him preying on children.`  
`If they paid with gift cards, sell them on websites like paxful for bitcoin.`  
`Don't report them after unless you have very good security. If you report them and they're going to court for this, they have NOTHING to lose by reporting you for blackmail, and the police can investigate you and try to trace you.`  
`If you guys could leave your free awards for me I'd really appreciate it because I wrote this myself, didn't think it'd be this long lol. Enjoy.`",hajani4,2021-08-27 18:22:06,67

The best part? He wasn't even interested in bitcoin or a bitcoin critic. He was just curious to see if that ballsy model was legit. For bitcoiners it was the most impactful thing to happen during that conference but for him, it was tuesday.",hajrn0c,2021-08-27 21:35:01,54

Asset owners benefit from inflationary out of thin air scam coin that is fiat. They can perpetually take loans against their assets and not pay taxes. They also are not paying any other taxes in general, they pay a fraction of a cost to lawyers and accountants to evade taxes legally.

Asset owners don't pay taxes and have the license to print money. They own assets that are highly valuable and only appreciate in value against the out of thin air scam coin that is fiat.

Their wealth is growing exponentially and they use that power to write the laws that benefit them and fuck the rest of us over. This type of corruption called lobbying.

They are united under the same interest, to fuck over the working people as much as possible and treat them as nothing but cattle exploited in a taxation farm. The whole fucking system is a scam.

Bitcoin is fuck you money. It is your chance to say fuck you to all of them. It is your freedom.

bitusher,"Some educated guesses why satoshi chose 21 million and the supply schedule-

1) One theory is that at the time of Satoshi’s decision to use 21 million as the finite number of Bitcoin, the global M1 money supply stood at approximately $21 trillion. In economics, this is the global money supply that includes physical currency and coins, demand deposits, traveler's checks, other checkable deposits

2) “I wanted to pick something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but without knowing the future, that’s very hard. I ended up picking something in the middle,” Nakamoto said. “If Bitcoin remains a small niche,” he added, “it’ll be worth less per unit than existing currencies. If you imagine it being used for some fraction of world commerce, then there’s only going to be 21 million coins for the whole world, so it would be worth much more per unit.”

3) Some believe that Bitcoin‘s 21 million limit was arbitrarily set by Nakamoto when he made two key decisions. That Bitcoin should add new blocks to its blockchain every 10 minutes (on average) and that the reward paid to miners halves every 210,000 blocks – roughly every 4 years.

4) ""A total of 174,100 tonnes of gold have been mined in human history, according to GFMS as of 2012.2 This is roughly equivalent to 5.6 billion troy ounces or, in terms of volume, about 9261 m3, or a cube 21.0 m on a side.""

5) 50x210,000(1+1/2+1/4+1/8+1/16....) or

50*210,000(2) = 21,000,000 is a nice clean equation to code and mathematically concise

6) It helps avoid errors on most computer systems, and, is likely sufficient for all possible transactions everywhere.

GetYourAssToPluto,"I'm *very* biased, but it's never been more clear to me that ETH is probably the most visibly undervalued asset in the entire crypto space. 

**Some big picture points:** Ethereum is a global, decentralized network that has just [41% of the market cap of Bitcoin](https://www.coingecko.com/en) but is settling [196% as much value each day](https://money-movers.info/), has users willing to pay [4,654% more in fees](https://cryptofees.info/) to purchase block space each day and has just made an upgrade (EIP-1559) at the protocol layer resulting in a [net-issuance reduction of 39%](https://watchtheburn.com) (this number is variable but has always been over ~28% and is currently trending upwards). Ethereum has achieve all this (and much more) while still - *today* - being searched for globally [roughly 75% less than bitcoin](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=ethereum,bitcoin) and having [45% fewer daily active addresses](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/on-chain-metrics/comparison-bitcoin-ethereum/number-of-active-addresses-7dma). 

And all of this is pre-merge aka The Triple Halvening/[The Cliffening](https://ethmerge.com/). This is why I think one day seeing $100k ETH is no hopium, no meme - if you're a long-term investor with a high amount of conviction in Ethereum. Crucially, you can't buy conviction, you can't fake conviction, and no person (or reddit comment) can truly sell you conviction. From my experiences, long-term conviction takes time, interest, and effort and has to be earned on a continual basis. Personally, Ethereum and ETH earned my conviction as a long-term investor back in 2017 and that conviction has only gotten stronger over the last 4 years.  

For the past several months, L1 blockchains like Solana and Cardano have been making incredible returns against ETH. That's great for them and for the holders of those coins, but I don't think it will last forever - most importantly, I don't think it will last *long term*. When ETH eventually rips to $4k and $6k and $10k and $20k+ (with *dozens* of corrections throughout), very few L1s, if any, will be able to outperform or even keep up. We can see evidence of this from the last major bull cycle and also from very recent history. For example, Avalanche (AVAX) increased 1,000% against ETH over the course of 37 days in January-February 2021. Today, even with recent 200% gains, AVAX is still [down 58% from its ATH against ETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/avalanche). 

A few recents tweets from Adriano Feria, with a chart of some of the 2017-2018 ETH killers (NEO, EOS, XRP, LSK), demonstrates this point perfectly:


&gt; This is a cautionary tale for those who are new to the crypto market and may be hungry for massive gains taunted by #Ethereum Killers.

&gt; These are [some of the top $ETH Killer contenders](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E97KZWgXsAAv5tZ?format=jpg&amp;name=orig) from the prior crypto cycle. All of which provided cheap fees (even cheaper now)

&gt; Every single one of these projects had a community of enthusiastic supporters who were sure the flipping was just around the corner because the tech was better and Ethereum was broken. [[Source](https://twitter.com/AdrianoFeria/status/1431806185863319555)]

&gt; There is one crypto asset that has been CONSISTENTLY [trending downward for the past 8 years.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E97El_NWEAEe1U7?format=jpg&amp;name=orig)

&gt; They say it's because there are thousands of shitcoins diluting the market, but somehow there is another asset that is trending up.

&gt; They say also say ""#Ethereum is like Myspace"". 🤔 [[Source](https://twitter.com/AdrianoFeria/status/1431800263011028994)]



I'm no trader, nor flipper - directly because of the experiences I've had trying (and sometimes succeeding and sometimes failing) to trade and flip assets that I had no actual conviction in. None of this is to say that a different person can't have the same level of conviction in a project like Solana or Cardano, many certainly do and that's fine. 

At the end of the day, it's the millions (and eventually billions) of users and developers and businesses and governments who will decide what's actually valuable and what's not.",haumua3,2021-08-30 06:13:20,94

Show84,"Banks such as JP Morgan have been investing in Bitcoin since 2017 all the while saying Bitcoin is bad.  Because they don't want a new technology to put them out of business and they don't want the general public to become wealthy.

Banks, politicians, corporations, government, they all spread FUD (Fear, Uncertainty Doubt) through the media.

The following is FUD:

Speaking at a conference in New York, the boss of America’s biggest bank said he would fire “in a second” anyone at the investment bank found to be trading in bitcoin. “For two reasons: it’s against our rules, and they’re stupid. And both are dangerous.”

The following is called hypocrisy:

He added: “The currency isn’t going to work. You can’t have a business where people can invent a currency out of thin air and think that people who are buying it are really smart.

Fiat money, is printed out of thin air.

3rd World countries with hyperinflation, also spreading FUD:

“If you were in Venezuela or Ecuador or North Korea or a bunch of parts like that, or if you were a drug dealer, a murderer, stuff like that, you are better off doing it in bitcoin than US dollars,” he said. “So there may be a market for that, but it would be a limited market.”

We are literally living in a historical time, as El Salvador is making Bitcoin legal tender.  More countries will soon follow.

More FUD... He's also shocked that people are intelligent and can see the benefits of a new technology:

It is worse than tulip bulbs,” Dimon said, referring to a famous market bubble from the 1600s. He predicted big losses for those investing in bitcoin. “Don’t ask me to short it. It could be at $20,000 before this happens, but it will eventually blow up,” he said. “Honestly, I am just shocked that anyone can’t see it for what it is.”

Fast forward to 2021 (After spreading FUD for 4 years). 

Banks now publicly saying they're offering Bitcoin to their RICH WEALTHY clients only.  (You see how they want the general public to stay poor?)

Car_Hibou,"Well, it is about risk tolerance. The best way to get rich is to go all-in in one asset... it's also the quickest way to get poor. I wouldn't go all-in on one cryptocurrency, but if you look at bitcoin, it did survive (and one could say, thrive) since 2009. It survived many adverse events, and one interesting metric is that it's 200 weekly EMA was never negative - meaning that someone buying BTC never lost money if they held for 4 years.

But could it crash, and crash hard? Yeah it could. Could it go to zero? Yes it could. As the old investor adage says, ""Don't invest in things you don't understand"". If you read on BTC and feel confortable in the technology and that it's going to stick around, put whatever amount you feel comfortable, and if past returns are indicative of future returns (which any financial advisor is obligated to tell you, isn't always the case), if you are ready to hold for four years you could have some profit in your pocket.

LogrisTheBard,"This is going to be a rant about the unfortunate end state of Defi if we continue along our current trajectory. The fundamental issue is that we’re using money for Sybil resistance. Simply using governance tokens as a vote count makes money correlate super-linearly to influence. Vitalk [recently wrote](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html) about this problem and it has been bubbling on my mind for some time. So let’s start with the basics, how we got here, where we will end up if we don’t course correct, where we want to be instead, and things we need to build to get there. 

Going back to basics, we need to reach consensus. We do this by voting amongst a set of peers whom are unwilling or unable to collude with one another to dishonest ends. Why are they unable to collude? Well, if they collude in public others will rally against them. As a memetic schelling point, fucking over dishonest actors that are attacking the system is tried and true classic (see ETC). So, to conspire effectively, they have to do so in secret. However, as the number of peers in a conspiracy grows it becomes exponentially more likely that a leak will occur. This creates a game theory scenario that makes it profitable and safe to be honest and risky to be dishonest. The more peers you have the better this system functions.

In a blockchain, you inherit the problem of Sybil resistance. Addresses are free. So how do you ensure that all voters are unique peers? Bitcoin uses proof of work to answer this. With proof of work you get voting proportional to the cost invested in your vote. Once you vote, that investment is gone. To offset these costs your vote comes with a lottery ticket and occasionally you win the lottery so the expected value of participating is positive. The actual source of Sybil resistance is money. Proof of resources invested in a vote that can’t be faked.

Proof of stake reuses this capital based notion of Sybil resistance. Rather than your investment being lost with every vote though your investment is reused from vote to vote which makes the system more capital efficient. However, it’s still money proportional to influence.

Governance tokens basically just extend the ideas of proof of stake. Starting with the food token craze, every project today seems to need to launch a governance token. Without it, there isn’t enough marketing power. Outside of some notable L2’s people just don’t have enough reason to care about your new thing amongst the thousand other things happening in Ethereum unless there is money to be made. A governance token distribution gets people to market their bags. This is all fine and well until it comes time to actually use those tokens for voting. Then several problems arise.

The first problem is voter apathy. When only 20-30% of the tokens are voting it gives outsized influence to whales. Most projects today don’t directly reward voting. Even if voting doesn’t take gas it still takes time and Defi is already past the limit of human attention if you want to be informed and vote on every project. There’s just too much going on. Clearly if active voters are a required component of an ecosystem they need to be incentivized directly. This goes against pure buyback + make/burn philosophy of Maker and argues in favor of systems like Kyber that explicitly direct profits to voters.

The second problem has to do with coordination amongst a large number of peers. It’s an age-old problem that technology has helped with but not perfectly solved. You can’t feasibly have thousands of people in a meeting with an open mic. Active voices have to be throttled or every meeting will just turn into twitch chat and the system can’t function at all. So how, do we throttle it? Often by voting weight. You get a handful of the most influential players in a room and talk about the most important issues of the day. This creates tiers of users though; those with a mic and those without. If these tiers are defined using money, even indirectly, then those with money have a categorically different amount of power than those without. Not just proportionally more influence, not just on another scale, but entirely new types of influence. If I donate $10 to a senator I get an automated thank you email; if I donate $10M to a senator I get direct personal access. Using governance tokens as we do leads to using money as a filter for tiers of power.

Getting political for a moment, I’m not suggesting a world where everyone has an equal say in everything. We live in a world today where we can’t agree on basic facts even when ignorance is literally a matter of life and death and people are dying by the millions. We need a system that directs influence to those with knowledge and good intention and money is at least partially effective at this. However, each necessary participant in an ecosystem should have and retain influence. An incentive system should not allow the influence of any necessary actor to entropy to zero over time.

This comes down to wealth inequality and wealth accumulation. These are at historically dangerous levels and accelerating every year. In historic times this was about when French heads started to roll. I doubt that kind of reset is viable today. The wealthy, at least the type I’m talking about, are no longer country locked, reachable in any material sense by a mob, or really accountable in just about any way for the evils they do.

Outside of just the top sub point-something percent the real wealth of the world is controlled by institutions. This capital is granted the rights of people while being effectively international, immortal, unjailable, and legally beholden to short term shareholder profits above all else. It is a dangerous recipe. They write the laws in their favor. They can manipulate and endanger global economies and and are not accountable for the harm they cause. Even when they get caught and convicted in court they pay a few days worth of their profit in a fine and continue on with business as usual. The wealth gap is **staggering**. I really can’t bold that enough. The gap is staggering, and growing every day.

If you are thinking that Defi is going to change that, think again. While Defi has democratized access to the financial system, the opportunities it provides still require capital. Once the regulatory clarity for institutional custody and voting procedures have been established these players will own crypto. Many already do and are aggressively hiring crypto capable talent. Wealth inequality is here to stay and it’s only getting worse. If we tie influence to capital, we set ourselves up for a rather dystopian future. Whatever cypher-punk anarchist utopian visions crypto founders had, we aren’t heading there unless we correct our course. So what can be done? Vitalik has several answers to this in his post. I’d like to build on a few of them and offer something of a vision for a possible future.

The first has to do with a different solution to Sybil resistance than money. While I’m aware of projects like proof of humanity and BrightID I don’t think a social solution can’t be eventually gamed. This problem exists today on reddit with bot networks that create a new account, post some repeatable meme, and then upvote themselves to bootstrap their account past the Turing test level. It’s an endless cat and mouse game like spam filtering. In the long term I think we’ll see a bunch of Legos taking the form of things like POAPs, some on chain history oracles, social attestation systems, and implicit KYC systems such as being whitelisted by Nexus Mutual and others. While no Lego is perfect the combination of them will be sufficient to enable systems like quadratic funding to function. This can reduce the influence of capital to alone to something resembling a logarithmic function rather than a super-linear one. I’m working on one such Lego personally.

Next, we need a standard delegation mechanism across Defi like xToken provides but tied to celebrity rather than “economic mandate” which is just too abstract to answer every governance vote. Delegation systems allow informed, public participants to rise in influence above their personal capital. I want to be able to shop for my representative to each project, delegate to them, and split the voting profits with them. Obviously this requires that more projects begin directly tying rewards to voter participation but I think this is inevitable. xToken is currently the frontrunner on a standard delegation platform but they can’t support a representative system at the moment because they can’t fragment the liquidity of each xToken. Either they’ll need to crack that underlying problem or another platform will come along eventually and replace them. As a bagholder I hope it’s the former.

Lastly, we need a good pattern for reputation systems that interplay with voting influence. If governance tokens represent monetary influence then reputation is inalienable (perhaps decaying) influence. Reputation would be earned against some combination of objective functions that each project could define. Maybe someone can build some type of pluggable oracle that maintains reputation scores for each project on an L2 which could integrate into snapshot. The details on this need a lot more thought. How are those objective functions defined? Is your monetary influence capped somehow by your reputation? Is there any way of discouraging people from “selling” their reputation by incentivized delegation? How do you solve the nothing at stake problem for those voting with reputation? It’s a complicated topic that needs a lot more work but I agree with Vitalik that we need to move past straight token voting and this is one of the most straightforward ways to do so.

zebrasv01,"Well, another thread regarding the launch of Btc in my country. At this point my mission on this sub is to provide a dose of reality on what is happening here. Sorry that it will burst the bubble of a lot of people, but things like this need to be heard.

The order of the day is confusion. Until now, 7 days until the law kicks in, the government is starting to place all the bitcoin ATMs in public spaces, a move that is considered a bit controversial since we don't know if the whole thing is being done by a public or private entity. The whole licitation process is lacking of transparency and nobody knows if it is the government handling everything or a private company the one in charge.

There has been very little effort in educating people about Btc and crypto in general. A massive campaign should have started since day 1,but this effort is missing. Because of this people are confused and feel that the whole Btc thing is being shoved down our throats (something I do agree tbh). You can check the polls and see that an overwhelming majority of salvadorans, over 70%,have a negative feeling towards the bitcoin law.

Regulations for businesses are still missing, nobody knows how Btc will be accounted and handled other than through the ""chivo app"". Only regulations that have been issued are for banks and financial institutions in which they need to inform their customers about certain information related to btc, for example the nature of blockchain transactions and that they are irreversible and give a sort of average of price fluctuation.

The whole thing just proves how incompetent the government has been in handling the issue and that more debate was needed, not just approving the law just because the president wanted it.

I'm afraid that the whole thing will be a fiasco and it will bring more harm than good. I just hope that other places that want to adopt crypto will follow better models.

The downside of Bitcoin is the same thing as the upside. No one can edit it. If you accidently send money to the wrong address, no one can reverse the transaction. 

Now that it has become obvious that Bitcoin is not very useful as a bank in the real world, the promoters of Bitcoin are suggesting that it could be used as a store of value like Gold.

There's always an excuse to bomb someone, if some of you think we are going to invade China over a virus, then you are mistaken, I don't want to go out in a fallout type universe where I'm fending for my life against looters or pillager.  As to Bitcoin?  It's not taking over, neither is any other currency for the time being, but there is something hypernormalized about the American economy, which I feel like is a lot less talked about, which is:  how many people are one paycheck away from the final push over the edge?  How many of them are willing to take what they get?  That's the part that gets hypernormalized to me.  Other countries might have worse economies but better social programs and even work conditions, the US had none of that.  So while other countries are in bad shape, I think that what's to come in the US is getting much worse, which is why you have so much talk and stories of people who have chose to leave while they can or already left.  Do you think the major corporations keep their profits here to get taxed?  Nope, it just doesn't show up on paperwork anywhere in the accounting department because it gets offshore somewhere else in a tax havens like Panama, which the US has not gone after, yet some countries have.  The US will collapse in a party, with people going to bars, going out to eat, going to baseball games, clubs, shows, and all the while the writing will be on the wall and we will still try to decipher what it means, but instead of having a prophet somewhere to interpret it for us (and there are many who are predicting economic and American collapse of some kind, they just have no writing on the wall to point to) we will blissfully go out not noticing as the collapse happens, and that will be normalized to.",hb2x7ze,2021-09-01 02:21:53,78

People aren't actually buying the clip. They don't have any ownership of the underlying intellectual property. If somebody buys an NFT for anything (Twitch clip or not), they are buying a hash/code that arbitrarily is assigned to said clip or item/concept.  


Example: You own a blue shirt, and I really like it. I offer to pay for an NFT for that shirt for $1,000. You can accept, and if you did, I would own a hash or code (not sure if it's always in this format) which in reality is shown on paper as ""NY7001PYU"". I own this NFT - NOT the shirt. I have no expectation of ever possessing, touching, seeing, or owning the shirt. I just own the hash/code that is ""associated"" with it.

JupiterXX,"You have it backwards. Market cap comes from price. Not the other way around. Here’s a comment I’ve left a few times that seems to help people:

Market cap is calculated based on the current price and that price is predicated on supply and demand. 

Here is the theory: Let’s say that everyone was holding and there was only a single xrp available. And let’s also say that someone wanted to use the ledger system to move $1000. They would then have to agree with the seller to buy it at a minimum of $1000 and assuming they could come to an agreement that then becomes the marginal rate. That then adjusts the market cap to be $44 trillion (or whatever). That does not mean all the coin is collectively worth that much, only that the coin is currently selling for that as an indication of strength of value based upon available supply and current demand. 

This is a copy paste from yet another comment I made in a different thread that might also help shed some light: 

I encourage you to try not to use market cap like this. Market cap is less of “how much is this coin collectively worth” and more of “how much is someone willing to pay for a coin today”. 

The market cap calculation is based on the marginal rate multiplied by the amount of coin. That is very different than saying someone paid a trillion dollars for all the Bitcoin. 

I’ll say it the reverse way. Let’s say that you owned all the Bitcoin and wanted to cash out. How much would you get for it? Not a trillion. Once you started to sell on the open market, it would lose value and you would struggle to find buyers at a given price. If you wanted to keep selling, you’d have to drop your price and then the market value would drop. So from this example, you can see that the real value of the coin is not the same as the market value. Not even close. 

Market value is more of a reflection of popularity across coins. It goes up when the demand goes up and down when the demand goes down. 

So, while I think it might be hard to hit $100, I do not think this because of any market cap limitation.",hb4c86s,2021-09-01 08:20:13,344

nimble2,"&gt;I met a person on Facebook dating and they pushed me to buy $10k worth of crypto (ETH) and trade it on bikipro88.xyz.

You didn't trade or invest your cryptocurrency, instead you sent it directly to the scammer's personal wallet.

&gt;Are there any reliable crypto tracers that could help me retrieve the money back?

No.  In this type of situation you will **ONLY** find ""recovery scammers"" who will suck even more money out of you while pretending that they can help you.

&gt;I am so confused and in shock with what has happened and would appreciate if I could get some guidance on this matter. 

**Fake Investment Scams that use Fake Cryptocurrency Websites:**

Fake cryptocurrency websites controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common.  Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency.  Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested.  Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website.  In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim’s account on their website.  Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website.  Sometimes the scammer will let the victim “remove” some of their money from the website (actually it’s just the scammer sending some of the victim’s money back to the victim) as a way to make the website seem legitimate, before asking the victim to “reinvest” even more of their money.  Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer’s wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer’s wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.

You can post the scammer’s wallet address here on r/scams.

Francis Ford Coppola, the producer of Clownhouse, told the child actors who brought the charges against the director that they'd never work in Hollywood again because of it. The director was found with video and pictures of him raping these boys. So he gets arrested and spends like 3 years in prison. he gets out and starts making movies again. because like I said Hollywood is fucked. Makes that movie Powder for Disney. Then makes Jeepers Creepers.

now let me explain Jeepers Creepers is about a monster that specifically preys on teenage boys. Like in one scene he sniffs a boys underwears and shit. They knew this director was a pedophile at the time. he write a movie that is basically about a pedophilic monster. And Hollywood pays him millions of dollars to make it. This is like if you paid a a child murderer to make A Nightmare on Elm Street for fuck sake. it is sick and deplorable. All this shit with calling people out in Hollywood is justified as fuck IMO. It's been this vile system that has bred pedophiles and predators for decades on decades. Because so much of it is just who you know, and who is in power.

 TL;DR: 

* Retired 5 years ago at age 47
* I had $925k invested in a couple of total market index funds.
* Used (and continue to use) 4% rule as my guideline.
* Investments now worth $1.4m
* I got lucky w/ this market

More deets:

* I've withdrawn far less than I anticipated (around 3%). Turns out those FIRE'd people were right: we spend far less than we anticipate, once we're actually in retirement.
* I do ACA, a high-deductible plan, while I've still got good health 
* Investments are 80% in a total market fund and 15% in a total bond fund, and 5% in bitcoin. Just kidding 5% in cash
* I don't pay rent; paid off my house a year before I FIRE'd. But that doesn't exclude me from $2k in monthly housing expenses like prop tax, skyrocketing insurance (fires/floods), and structural upkeep. Nor does it exclude me from the substantial lost opportunity cost of using investment capital to pay off the mortgage (I'd be a multi-millionaire if I'd kept the mortgage and kept that capital in index funds)
* Yes, my good fortune will likely be challenged when the market crashes like it's historically supposed to do, and inflation spikes even more, and my body starts aging like older bodies tend to do
* But for now it's flipping awesome",hb9s291,2021-09-02 12:12:10,133

You could conservatively collateralize 5% of your stack ($50k) on a 50% LTV loan and use that $25k to pay your mortgage, bills,.etc.

The $25k is tax free and costs $200/mo in interest.  Then 1 year later you take out another 5% to pay off the first loan and capture the surplus in the market appreciation.  If the market was down YoY you can take out 10-15% collateral to pay off the original loan and work your leverage back down to 5% when the market pumps again.

If the person fundamentally believes that price will increase over the long run I don't see how this strategy fails unless the person allows the leverage get out of control and/or ignores any potential margin calls along the way.

 Right now the I consider the price to be decent for purchasing. I've bought anywhere from $.50-$1.60 with an avg right in the middle somewhere. I'm buying some more while I can.


 The price will likely not see any huge changes until the SEC case concludes which could be anywhere from 2 week through sometime in early 2022. If it is favorable for Ripple/XRP this could drive the price up significantly. It will be relisted on sites and I'd expect a fair amount of people to buy. If the outcome looks bad for Ripple the price might take a hit but I dont think it spells the end by any means. They could simply move their base of operation out of the US and carry on.

In the dark future of 2038, the roughly .2 Bitcoin created in each block are worth $200m, with almost $30b in Bitcoin created each day.  Bitcoin mining alone takes half the US GDP, and consumes over 80% of the world's electricity.  A single transaction costs over $100,000.

The ~21m BTC in existence are worth a staggering $21,000,000,000,000,000 or 21 quadrillion dollars.  This outstrips the total value of all wealth in the world by a factor of 400.  None of it is ever spent, because a) transaction costs are too high and b) its value can only continue to increase.

AMos050,"&gt;I know there are many other cryptocurrencies but they are less established.

Bitcoin only accounts for 41% of the crypto market cap, so I think you're doing other crypto, especially Ethereum, a disservice here.

&gt;However, unlike other speculation like antiques, art, real estate, etc. crypto has no inherent value.

I don't really agree that something like art has more inherent value than the paper it's printed on. Real estate does of course but it's hardly a speculative investment since shelter is a human need.

Crypto's value comes from being decentralized and easily transferable. You can't send art or real estate at the click of a button with no intermediaries like you can with crypto.

&gt;cryptocurrency is just currency- it doesn't have growth/earnings potential.

It's actually classified by the US government as a commodity, but moreover there are lending platforms such as BlockFi that will pay a solid interest rate to keep your Bitcoin on their platform so that they can use it as part of lending pools. Whether or not you think that's worth it is up to you.

&gt;Unlike currency such as gold, cryptocurrency can't be converted into jewelry, statues, etc. Gold seems similar to cryptocurrency in that it has a fairly limited supply, whereas the dollar is ""pretend"". As far as I know, no country currently uses the gold standard. Today economies run on ""pretend"" money which seems to work pretty well.

All true but Bitcoin isn't trying to be converted into jewelry or used as a national currency (except maybe in countries with hyperinflation); that isn't the use case here.

&gt;I did some calculations to show that crypto is hundreds of times more variable compared to real currencies. Also, its value is steadily increasing compared to other currencies, which seems very concerning to me. Real world currencies, as far as I know, don't behave this way unless an economy is collapsing.

It's a commodity, not a currency. The demand for it (and therefore the price) swings wildly because it's so new and the market hasn't decided on its value. Also worth noting that while other countries have been printing trillions of dollars over the last year, the supply of Bitcoin has increased only marginally at a predetermined rate.",hbg3fgd,2021-09-03 22:53:34,125

SourerDiesel,"The reaction to all these bullish forecasts from institutions has been kind of surprising to me.  Most upvoted comments tend to be ""hopium"" or ""manipulation.""

The thesis on bitcoin for HODLers has always been about hyperbitcoinization.  Is it not possible that we're hitting a tipping point and the institutions are simply recognizing it before the general public?  Yes, they've tried many times to kill BTC in the past, but they're rarely hard-headed when it comes to making money - they'll flip from short to long in a heart beat if they believe that's the way the market is going.

Personally, this is kind of how I've been expecting it to go.  The game is rapidly changing from ""bitcoin is risky"" to ""it's risky *not* to own bitcoin"".  Seems to me we'd expect the institutional investors to figure this out just before the average person does.",hbh9t4u,2021-09-04 03:50:39,54
BTCDEX,"I recently lost some funds due to malware which had full control over my browser. It resulted in a Binance hack with 2FA on.

The malware had access to my google chrome browser. The gmail account was a separate one, but it was logged in at the moment. They placed an email filter for ""do-not-reply@directmail2.binance.com"" on it, so it looked like the mails never arrived (such as withdrawal confirmation code). On top of that they placed a binance login redirection from the legit site (I always check), so after login in with 2FA, the page seems to refresh and 2FA needs to be entered again: once to login and once to approve the transaction...all altcoins converted instantly to bitcoin, so they only needed one transaction confirmation. Whitelisting can help a little, but eventually it only takes them longer to get the funds as they need you to login a second time a few days later.

Luckily it was only a fraction of my crypto, because the majority is on cold storage on a hardware wallet. Had to reinstall my laptop completely to get rid of the malware, really nasty. Not sure how it got there...probably when downloading a desktop wallet app from some new project.

My advice:

1) Use a separate email address only to access crypto exchanges and only open it on a separate device. If you have malware on your pc, they can basically follow whatever you're doing in the browser and even put a filter on binance emails so you won't notice the withrawal confirmation code mails 
2) Activate 2FA with an authenticator app and NEVER enter the 2FA twice in a row during login. Hackers can refresh the legit login page after the first 2FA entry, and make it seem like you have to enter again, while actually you are confirming the withrawal...
3) Whitelist crypto addresses
4) Ideally access the exchange on a separate device  e.g. ipad

anykeyh,"Solana is hyped by: 
- Overall branding &amp; marketing. Their blogs, their naming, their resources, and the few first applications are at a top-level execution.
- Big VCs are in the party
- Great tech, presented with even greater bullshit to make it look awesome (a sort of Tesla for Blockchain).

On another side, Harmony is much more tech-oriented and lacks a bit in terms of image. 
Let's put it like this: Harmony looks like a bunch of geeks doing cool stuff and not being evil. 
Solana's team looks like a bunch of seasoned businessmen creating the Tesla of the blockchain. I rather prefer 100% the first option, although I might feel alone sometimes. 

Just to be clear, Harmony has nothing to be shy of, in comparison to Solana in terms of technology. An example:

- Block propagation algorithms are exactly the same for both Harmony and Solana (p2p distribution with parity bits). Harmony call this ""Adaptative IDA"". Solana calls this the ""Turbine"". Unless you are an engineer, you will feel the latter more appealing than the first one.

In the long term, sharding is the key. Solana's ability to 50'000 tps (on paper) will never be enough for the world of tomorrow. People always compare blockchain TPS to Visa network, but they forget transferring value via blockchain is just like sending email over the internet. It's trendy today and occupies most of the network like it was in 1995 for the emails.

Also, Visa is not so much used. How many times do you use your card each day (2~3)? How many countries do not use Visa or by-card payment? (70% of the population).

Solana will never be able to compete in terms of transaction cost versus a sharded blockchain. 
This is just physically impossible, as nodes in Solana need to validate all transactions instead of a fraction of them.

Blockchain in the future will be the mesh of every interaction with our connected world. Mark my word: 50'000 TPS is nothing when most humans on earth will soon interact thousand of times a month with BC technologies.

In 15 years, our interactions with Blockchain technology will be in the hundred times a day, not 3 or 4 transactions. We are currently the 1%, and we see only Defi usage, fed by greed. 

In 5 years will see 20x more people, with 10x more usage, at least 1000x in usage growth.

Ownership, identity, governance, and service distribution apps will come soon, once governments catch up and proper regulatory frameworks are set up, market mature and successful Karen-proof apps are released.

My second grief to Solana is their tech doesn't allow individuals to Validate or participate in the network. Because the cost of setup is prohibitive.

If decentralized means hundreds of mid to large-size companies contribute to the network, so yeah it might be decentralized.

That's not my vision of decentralization. Because it doesn't protect for example from governments. Each validator based on Solana will need to be a company or an organization as the setup and annual fees are a few hundred thousand dollars minimum. They will need to comply with authority or will be taken down. 

What will happen if tomorrow Uncle Sam asks Solana validators to stop accepting interacting with Iranian-based IP or accounts? Will they comply? This cannot exist on Bitcoin for example, and there is little chance it will work with Harmony too.
Today even a non-American company need to comply with international sanction unless being blacklisted to make business with any US entity/individual. 

That's not my vision of what should be Blockchain tech. I see it as a tool and don't think any political means should interact with the network. It needs to be neutral, and yeah I don't care if the Taliban are using Harmony, it's a TOOL meant to be used by humans for the greater good or the worst bad.

In the short term, I don't see Harmony going to the moon like Solana. But I see it steadily growing and attract great world-class applications. Still, I feel huge profits will be taken if you invest in Harmony today.",hbke39j,2021-09-04 22:26:06,241

Amber_Sam,"Congrats on the move, it's never too late. ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE. 


&gt;because of the imminent grow up of next week.

**Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, nor next week.** Statistically, it's less than four years from now. Anyone who bought Bitcoin at any point in the past and held it for 4+ years is in profit. 

**Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least first year**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to.

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for SATs. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://amber.app/calculate-your-investment/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference.


&gt;Where do you guys bought it?

Now, don't buy a fake Bitcoin at etoro, RH, PayPal or similar, get the real thing. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin) 


&gt;I have an exodus wallet.

That wallet is closed source, I wouldn't trust anything that isn't open source with my Bitcoin. I wouldn't even trust Bitcoin if it wasn't open source.

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets. 

A few good wallet choices:

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io/) \- excellent, easy to use wallet, Open Source and Non-Custodial (although, Lightning is custodial!)

[https://www.wasabiwallet.io/](https://www.wasabiwallet.io/) \- Excellent privacy, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets.

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for very small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix works on Android

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - Android or iOS, excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill or LN Pizza

[https://muun.com/](https://muun.com/) \- Muun, simple and elegant LN wallet - Android or iOS

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[https://trezor.io/](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're.

[https://coldcardwallet.com/](https://coldcardwallet.com/) \- ColdCaard is currently the safest and most recommended here.

There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend as not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, etc. Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different than the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words &amp;amp;amp; passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words &amp;amp;amp; passphrase(s) safe.

IOTA is the only one iterating on these breakthroughs by applying the same kind of virtual voting as Bitcoin (longest chain wins) to a chainless DAG structure. Because there isn’t just one chain, everyone can add transactions wherever they want in the structure, this also means we don’t need an election process like POW to determine the next leader allowed to append to the structure. Because there are no leaders, no election and thus no mining we don’t need fees. No blocks and no fees also means better latency and more throughput while also allowing other usecases like data only transactions. Data only transactions opens a lot of usecases, for instance project alvarium, a combined effort by the iota foundation Dell and others to create a data trust layer decentralizing data and giving people a way to look up how trustworthy that data is.",hbmc6mi,2021-09-05 07:21:49,108

rdood2,"I'm going to respectfully but very strongly disagree with this opinion. I think you need to look into cryptocurrency token supplies and understand their resulting impacts on the price. A coin like QNT has a current supply of only 12 million and a maximum supply of 14 million. HBAR in comparison has a current supply of 9.6 billion but a maximum supply of 50 billion. 

Have you done high school economics? I want you to think of a supply/demand diagram, if you don't know what it is, you can search it up. Basically when supply is scarce, like QNT, the price naturally increases as it is harder to become an owner of a scarce resource. A real life example was when a Hurricane hit Queensland in Australia a few years ago, taking out all the Banana plantations. The price of Banana's skyrocketed here as they became scarce. 

Now funnily enough, QNT and HBAR's market caps are almost exactly the same at just under 3 billion. But a QNT is worth $242 and a HBAR is worth $0.3. Why is this? I want you to think back to the supply/demand diagram I referenced earlier. The law of scarcity is being applied here, which basically states that when the supply is scarce, a resulting disequilibrium occurs between the demand/supply curves. Upward pressures will be placed on the price until a new equilibrium is found where supply=demand. In the case of QNT, this is what we've seen in the past few months, the demand has been outstripping the supply and to find a new equilibrium, the price has had to increase. In comparison, HBAR's current supply is about 750 times the supply of QNT, so for HBAR's price to reach QNT's price, we need demand to multiply by 750.

Now if HBAR were to reach the $300 price as you've stated and the demand for it does multiply by 750, it would reach a market capitalisation of more than that of Apple. But we haven't considered that HBAR still needs to release another 40 billion or so coins. If HBAR were to reach bitcoin's market cap with a maximum supply, it would be worth $18.73 (which is still massive!) but I believe HBAR can be worth much more than bitcoin, let's pretend we go best case scenario and it does become the ""trust layer of the internet"" with the biggest market cap in the world. It's price at a 5 trillion market cap would be $100. This would take many years to occur, 10-20 years, possibly more through heavy adoption, to the point where almost all transaction, financial and smart contract processes are run through HBAR. 

All in all, I don't believe it's possible to ever reach a 15 trillion market cap at the price of $300 as there's simply not enough money and adaptation in the world for that to happen. Let's focus on reaching $1 first! :)",hbnku7r,2021-09-05 14:06:54,54

durlsty,"I think it’s important to realise that this internal comparison and feelings of inferiority is not coming from the basis of reality. Objectively, we should all feel shitty about ourselves because Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the world and none of us will ever come close. So why is that we feel so shitty when we compare to our peers instead of the objectively rich? 

Because we rationalise it, we think since our peers are “quite” similar to us, then we could have done what they did. “If only I bought Bitcoin like him last year”, “If only I graduated with a GPA 4.6”, these are all false reasons. We all know people’s road to success is much more than a single decision. Some of your friends made a lot of sacrifices to reach where they are, and you only get to see a small part of their life story. 

So knowing that, how do you feel less shitty? I think a good step is to find out what metrics are important to you? Is it power, money, popularity? And find out why you hold these metrics so highly. Why do you want to be a leader? Why do you want to be rich? And afterwards, ask yourself, what are you willing to give up for it and make a plan. Heck, maybe turn that envy into productivity and ask your friends out for coffee so that you can learn from them. 

But I think there’s something deeper than trying to emulate what your friends do and that is the feeling of envy and comparison. If you want to get rid of the feeling of inferiority, you will also have to get rid of the feeling of superiority you have over others. The act of comparing is harmful and even if you feel better by thinking “At least I’m not like THAT person”, you are still engaging in it. Catch those moments when you are comparing yourself with people and remind yourself that all of us are writing our own stories. 

There’s no objective metric of success out there, it’s up to you to find your own definition of success/purpose and plan how to get there.

TLDR: You can make a plan and learn from your friends OR find your purpose and stick to it.",hbrlwql,2021-09-06 12:19:03,96

mark_able_jones_,"Regardless of what happens, this subreddit definitely needs more skepticism. Making a hero out of Bukele was particularly disgusting. 

Crypto has several problems: 

1. It's already dominated by the super rich, who had disposable income to toss a Bitcoin eight years ago. If I had extra millions laying around, I would have thrown some at Bitcoin. Why not. Bitcoin's wealth distribution is worse than North Korea. We can stop pretending like crypto is going to save poor people. It is a rich person's game.
2. Tether. We all know.
3. NFTs are total bullshit. People paying for text files saved to the blockchain. Absurd.
4. Why does crypto need to be publicly traded? For example, if a bank wanted to move wealth easily between two different institutions, it would almost make more sense to use XRP as a technology (stablecoin) to transfer and receive the wealth on the other end. Or some other tech. 
5. Blockchain technology is not as innovative as the internet. It's a minor change to the ledger system that eliminates the central validator--which mostly helps people commit crimes. Valid use cases here are not abundant.

1. Where would all of this wealth be going if it were not going into crypto, which is basically gambling on internet currencies? The stock market. The stock market is worth $50 trillion. If crypto goes 10x again soon, no one will be investing in real businesses. It's super messy.
2. At what point does crypto destabilize the dollar? There are crazy, real-world issues with this happening. Namely, if the dollar loses all its value because crypto takes over, many people will get left behind. And then being your bank will become extremely dangerous. 
3. The threat of crypto crime is very real. Instead of banks being targets, people will be targets. If someone really wanted your crypto, they could almost certainly get it.",hbs7kcf,2021-09-06 16:09:31,112

It shouldn't surprise you that El Salvador, being a Banana Republic itself continues to be a huge AmeriKKKa shill. So the President of El Salvador who is definately not a 21st-century CIA plant decided in order to shift the nation's economic troubles and chronic crime problem by declaring it's country to be the first one to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender (for no appealing reason), alongside with the existing US dollar. Essentially the entire country will be subserviant to Crypto whales if they ever want to leverage their Scooge McDuck size BTC wallets and completely make El Salvador into their bitch.

goodbyesuzy,"The most downloaded finance applications in the country are all Bitcoin related. El Salvador has built and released their Bitcoin wallet (Chivo) on top of the lighting network (A Bitcoin second layer) allowing for free and instantaneous transactions. RIGHT NOW you can buy a coffee at Starbucks or a burger at McDonalds using Bitcoin. BUT, all prices are still denominated in American dollars. 

People aren’t being paid in Bitcoin and most citizens aren’t holding their wealth in Bitcoin either. Because of this, the fluctuation in Bitcoins price doesn’t affect anyone. Bitcoin is simply the “rails” that the country is using to make payments and send remittances. 

Example: I’m holding $200 USD in my Chivo wallet and want to buy a hamburger. I click transfer in the wallet and $3 (the cost of the burger) is converted to Bitcoin, sent to the seller and instantly converted back to USD for free. There is no risk in this scenario and the buyer and seller don’t have to pay a fee to an intermediary (the bank or the credit card company)

OhHiGCHQ,"Honestly? Right wing Libertarians.

I say that because *left wing* libertarians (believe it or not but the word ""libertarian"" refered to left wing ideologies until the 70s) are usually chill people and include the likes of Social Ecologists, communitarians, Anarchists, Bookchinites and the like, basically people who hate the state but also hate capitalism and believe the way to go is decentralised, community based, and confederated. They support things like mutual aid, community assemblies, worker/community ownership and such like.

Right wing libertarians on the other hand make the Ferengi look altruistic and like to openly advocate for child labour, company towns and corporatocracy. They'll talk about freedom and liberty but then right after that adovcate for a system where the rich control everything and your life boils down to ""Obey the rich and be paid a small sliver of what you actually produce or starve"", which to me doesn't sound much like liberty and more like Victorian England. It sounds like a world where the poor work for low wages and no real prospect of advancement unless they get *really* fucking lucky while a small class of owners who own everything from the land to the thoughts in people's heads live off the work of others.

Oh and when push comes to shove the Right wing libertarians when faced with issues like the state using violence against protesters always seemingly side with Right wing Authoritarians (the Traditional right, conservatives, the ""Alt-right""). They're totally okay with the Police using Agent Provocateurs to spark off riots and use equipment banned on the battlefield to attack unarmed protesters, but ***god fucking forbid*** those same police tell them they can't use 10 year olds to built bitcoin miners because that's on their *private property!* When the state uses their tax money to help people they get up in arms and start babbling on about leeches but are oddly silent when those same taxes get poured into police that they use to bust unions and take away the few possessions Homeless people have. They're totally okay with that to protect their property, just not everyone elses. Oh and they seem okay with their taxes going directly to their companies in the form of contracts where they can pocket half of it and use the other half to make shitty products for a quater of the actual cost.

Oh, and who do they count amongst their great thinkers? Well Murray Rothbard, a man who openly advocated for selling children. William Rees-Mogg, a man who literally co-authored a book about how to crash and economy to make money from it. Ayn Rand, a woman so against Altruism that she developed her own cult around it where even Romance was frowned upon. They're only for ""freedom"" and ""liberty"" when it comes to fucking other people over but when it comes to stopping the state or corporations fucking over people, they are okay with it. 

An Anarchist hates the state because it harms people, while a Libertarian hates the state because it helps people.

\&gt;all of a sudden a car that looks from the 60s and very damaged parks on the other side of the street

\&gt;The door opens, the sheers smell coming out is enough to kill everyone in there

\&gt;some guy inside the car struggles to get out.

\&gt;he's probably 450 pounds, wearing a fedora and holding an anime body pillow of some clearly underage character

\&gt;guy behind me sees that I'm annoyed

\&gt;explains that he's that chick's husband, she married him because of money

\&gt;""yea he invested his parents house into bitcoin before it was popular and now he has a lot of money""

\&gt;we chat for a bit more, the guy behind me is called Chad, very nice guy

\&gt;we chat for a bit more

\&gt;at this point I'd prefer to be TOPPED by Chad than to fuck this chick

\&gt;it's the morbidly obesy cuck, he tripped

\&gt;he's rolling like a ball, 20 mph directly at us

\&gt;10 men are pushing him

\&gt;he finally entered the house, mother fucker can't stop giggling

\&gt;he sits down and opens a trashy laptop

\&gt;its screen is probably filled with crusty cum and dorito powder

The person controlling this address is very likely the  Binance client  with the deposit address 1JHNETTaxquUWBn4ke8DaYWqzSJKmiPYuP. So go to law enforcement and ask them to freeze the scammers funds at Binance. The scammer seems to be very active at Binance so it's likely there is something to freeze. Alternatively the police can ask Binance for the id, bank data or withdrawal addresses of this person. If the police in your country is too slowly then try it with a lawyer.   


Report:   
If cases like this are handed over from one person to the next inside law enforcement or exchanges it's helpful to have a report with the evidence. You can do this on your own if you or your friends have a quite good understanding of bitcoin transactions. We programmed more or less these attacks:

cannainform2,"Save a click: 
A man may end up behind bars for 15 years after he was allegedly caught mining Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies inside the county center in Riverhead, New York.

The Associated Press reports that Christopher Naples, an IT operations supervisor at the county clerk’s office, is facing charges for public corruption, grand larceny, and computer trespass for secretly installing 46 crypto miners inside the government building.

The 42-year-old, an employee of the county for over two decades, allegedly placed the devices in six rooms, hiding them in locations like unused electrical wall panels and underneath floorboards. Authorities say that some of the machines had been in place since February. 

Suffolk County District Attorney Timothy Sini says that Naples’ scheme cost the public coffers at least $6,000 in electricity bills.

“Mining cryptocurrency requires an enormous amount of resources, and miners have to navigate how to cover all of those electricity and cooling costs. [Naples] found a way to do it; unfortunately, it was on the backs of taxpayers.”

Sini also says that Naples had placed so many miners inside the building that several employees were complaining about the slow internet speed, and when miners were removed from one room, the temperature dropped by more than 20 degrees.

“Not only do we have thousands of dollars of taxpayer money funding this operation, but it also put the county’s infrastructure at risk.”",hck521f,2021-09-12 22:15:44,85

MinimalGravitas,"Decentralization is pretty much the point of crypto for a lot of people. 

The one complaint about Ethereum is the high fees, which come down to something called the blockchain trilemma, you have to balance decentralization, security and scalability. It comes about basically because there's a limit to how much data each block can hold, validators/miners/nodes must process blocks in a secure way to avoid rollbacks etc, but the bigger your blocks the more powerful hardware is needed and so the less people will run nodes.

Bitcoin and Ethereum have both prioritized decentralization and security on their layer 1s, I've run a bitcoin full-node before on an old PC and basically the low requirements mean it can just be done as a hobby project, which lots of people do. Both chains' nodes can even be run on a Raspberry Pi.

The compromise is that the space for transactions that can be processed per unit time is relatively low. For Bitcoin this doesn't hugely matter because the only transactions being done are simple transfers of BTC. For Ethereum this is much more of an issue because there are lots of much more complex transactions (such as token swaps and interacting with liquidity pools for dApps) that need to write more data to the chain and therefore take up more space.

Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are solving this through the use of layer 2 solutions, Lightning Network for Bitcoin and Rollups for Ethereum. Almost all other chains that offer lower fees do so by sacrificing decentralization for scalability. They then either make some vague hand waiving platitude about decentralizing more in the future (e.g Solana) or just market themselves at a captive audience of newbies who don't yet understand why decentralization matters (e.g. Binance 'Seriously-only-11-block-producing-validators' Chain).

With regards specifically to Solana you can read about their validators here https://solanaguide.github.io/staking/how-much-do-solana-validators-make/ - this makes the point that on top of the hardware requirements a validator needs to own 5000 SOL staked to its own network to break even. People often point out that the staking requirements of 32 ETH are high, but for Solana is the token cost is roughly 10x higher.

I'm in crypto because I want the future economic system to look different to the current one. I want the financial dominance of huge banks and corporations to be a topic of history. I want anyone in the world to have access to the same financial tools and advantages as the richest segment of society. I want a transparent monetary system where if you try to hide your income from the taxman in an offshore shell company, anyone can just lookup the transaction ID in a block explorer. I want a world where we don't need to seek permission to deploy a good idea, where we don't need to trust some 3rd party who sits between us and our assets.

I want a decentralized economy. There's a long way to go before we get there, and there's plenty of hurdles on the road ahead, but I believe there's at least a possibility of bringing it about. If that means paying more for transactions at the moment rather than switching to cheaper options that comprises the core values I believe in then I don't mind at all. If it's a choice between short term profits or the chance for complete systemic change it seems to me there's not really a choice at all!",hckhad1,2021-09-12 23:51:54,118

It stood the test of time to survive several bear markets, and I think with the inclusion of DOGE's OG devs, Vitalik, and Elon's financial officer in the next leg of their development with ETH, that's a solid future prospect.

Nike's best selling shoe in 2020 was the Air Force 1, and it was using a tech dated back in the early 1980s. Why do people buy that shoe instead of newer shoes with cushioning? Because of the branding, and story-pull factor.

Right now if I buy Bitcoin, and that Bitcoin appreciates, and I use some of that Bitcoin to buy myself a new laptop, I have to report that as capital gains.  Specifically, I have to calculate out what the appreciation was on the particular coin value I used to buy the laptop, and pay tax on that.  
If you buy Bitcoin frequently, and want to use it to pay for things, this is totally unworkable.  It adds a GIGANTIC tax burden of calculating out a 'capital gain' every single time you either sell Bitcoin, or trade Bitcoin for any other crypto, or use Bitcoin to buy things.  

Now, if you see Bitcoin only as a tradeable asset- that is, no need to make purchases with it, it's only good for trading and not using, then yes taxing Bitcoin makes sense because it's 'playing with the big boys' like other assets.  

But if you want Bitcoin and other crypto to be used as a transactional currency, to be used in commerce or trade, then taxing Bitcoin as an asset basically inhibits use of crypto in commerce or trade.  

THAT is why crypto shouldn't be taxed- because taxing crypto with capital gains inhibits its use in trade.",hcn9s7b,2021-09-13 11:48:44,56

retire-early,"Folks, if you're worried just sit back, take a few deep breaths.  Now, ask yourself:

* Is the economy in a good place and getting better?
* Does the ""new highs every day"" stock market reflect the economic reality on the ground?
* Are housing prices, now at all time highs, likely to continue up?  Prices are correlated to interest rates - if rates go up, houses become less affordable.  Do you see negative interest rates being accepted by investors forever?
* Is inflation transitory?

If not, then you need an alternative to the market.  Something that's at least uncorrelated, and even better something that's likely to go up when the market and economy go south.  With the Everything Bubbles getting bigger, as I see it you have three options:

1. Precious Metals.  These retain purchasing power when economic times are rough, though I'd expect a big drop in short-term valuations if we reach the point where margin calls are everywhere.  Then the rocket's first stage ignites.
2. Real Estate.  Yes, it's overpriced, but it  outputs (rent, or produce, or wood) are all the sorts of things that keep up with inflation and generate cash flow, and if you can lock in a 2% rate it's almost free to pay off if real rates finally jump back to something unimaginable, like the historic average of 7%.
3. Crypto.  I'm not a believer here, but I've been wrong on this for 100,000% so far.  I wish I'd put just 2% of my portfolio into bitcoin, but I can't go back and re-do that.

You've bought silver.  You're fine.  Relax.  Keynes, after he greatly outperformed the market then went bust, but before he invented the whole Keynesian Economics thing, said in his defense that ""Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.""

Mister Market is irrational as fuck right now.  We all see it.  Big funds don't have a choice but to keep riding the escalator towards the cliff and hope they can get off in time.  They look like geniuses because Stonks Only Go Up in the current era.

Few-Nothing-4607,"Can confirm. I am involved in real estate on the side in greater Portland and it's a big issue, at least that's what I hear from the networks I've joined. It's not just non-resident second homes; but non-resident second homes for non-US residents. That isn't meant to be a xenophobic dog whistle or anything, merely noting that everything else equal a foreign second home purchaser is apt to spend even less time in the unit than a domestic resident. In fact, there's a lot of speculation that many of these purchasers are really just purchasing the property as a store of value, almost like bitcoin. Of course that's really difficult to prove.

The biggest problem in my opinion isn't just the reduction in useable housing, but the long term economic impact. Portland proper grew by just 3% in **ten years.** Less than half of what Biddeford, Saco, and Brunswick grew by, and roughly a seventh of what Westbrook grew by. People can't move to Portland if there's nowhere to live, and businesses can't open in Portland if there's nobody to hire.

Another issue is with the Short Term Rental market. From the perspective of a landlord, STRs are so popular because they're arguably more profitable than long-term housing, significantly less work (since it's a seasonal market), and with the whole eviction moratorium, much less risk.

The whole thing is a mess. The problem is that realtors are making out like bandits, and aren't exactly inclined to look more thoroughly into the buyers, and people selling their homes don't usually care -- or even know -- how the home they're selling is going to be used.

A lot of ideas have been tossed around to address the issue. The problem with just blanket taxing the owners of second homes is that -- at least historically -- a huge portion of these folks have been average-joe retirees who have two modest homes, one in Florida, one in Maine. These folks really aren't the ones to point the finger at in my opinion, as they're using their second homes for good faith reasons that are often related to health and comfort for the elderly (Maine is not senior-friendly in wintertime).",hcpup2c,2021-09-14 02:58:49,64

robomartin,"I always get downvoted when bringing this up, but theory is that Blockfi invested heavily in the grayscale BTC trust (GBTC) to the point where they owned over 5% of the entire fund. This is publicly documented by Blockfi’s disclosures.

It seemed like a clever scheme back when institutions could buy in at cost and then sell at a premium to retail investors after a lock up period. And there is also a lending market for those shares. So it made sense to them to buy these shares at the time rather than just hold onto the physical Bitcoin

That premium got erased though and eventually became negative and is still negative. So their scheme for profiting off the GBTC trust no longer works and they’re also underwater holding these GBTC trust shares that nobody wants, and they’re stuck paying a 2% annual fee on the Bitcoin inside the trust",hcqp2ov,2021-09-14 06:24:35,74

He realized 1 of the various reasons why the crash happened is because the irresponsibility of the financial elites( government and wall street). So he created a currency without a need of a middleman, so regular people can seize back economic control of their own lives.

MinimalGravitas,"Decentralization is pretty much the point of crypto for a lot of people. This is why BTC and ETH sit where they do in marketcap rankings.

The one complaint about Ethereum is the high fees, which come down to something called the blockchain trilemma, you have to balance decentralization, security and scalability. It comes about basically because there's a limit to how much data each block can hold, validators/miners/nodes must process blocks in a secure way to avoid rollbacks etc, but the bigger your blocks the more powerful hardware is needed and so the less people will run nodes.

Bitcoin and Ethereum have both prioritized decentralization and security on their layer 1s, I've run a bitcoin full-node before on an old PC and basically the low requirements mean it can just be done as a hobby project, which lots of people do. Both chains' nodes can even be run on a Raspberry Pi.

The compromise is that the space for transactions that can be processed per unit time is relatively low. For Bitcoin this doesn't hugely matter because the only transactions being done are simple transfers of BTC. For Ethereum this is much more of an issue because there are lots of much more complex transactions (such as token swaps and interacting with liquidity pools for dApps) that need to write more data to the chain and therefore take up more space.

Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are solving this through the use of layer 2 solutions, Lightning Network for Bitcoin and Rollups for Ethereum. Almost all other chains that offer lower fees do so by sacrificing decentralization for scalability. They then either make some vague hand waiving platitude about decentralizing more in the future (e.g Solana) or just market themselves at a captive audience of newbies who don't yet understand why decentralization matters (e.g. Binance 'Seriously-only-11-block-producing-validators' Chain).

I'm in crypto because I want the future economic system to look different to the current one. I want the financial dominance of huge banks and corporations to be a topic of history. I want anyone in the world to have access to the same financial tools and advantages as the richest segment of society. I want a transparent monetary system where if you try to hide your income from the taxman in an offshore shell company, anyone can just lookup the transaction ID in a block explorer. I want a world where we don't need to seek permission to deploy a good idea, where we don't need to trust some 3rd party who sits between us and our assets.

I want a decentralized economy. There's a long way to go before we get there, and there's plenty of hurdles on the road ahead, but I believe there's at least a possibility of bringing it about. If that means paying more for transactions at the moment rather than switching to cheaper options that comprises the core values I believe in then I don't mind at all. If it's a choice between short term profits or the chance for complete systemic change it seems to me there's not really a choice at all!",hcsgsv8,2021-09-14 15:15:36,67

I also believe the slow pace of releases shows that a careful auditing process is being made by the developer community. Lastly the bitcoin nodes can update to a new release, but they are not forced, so it will happen gradually making it less risky for a bug -or a malitious hack- of this kind to happen and damage the network.

Understanding this is a strong open source community (I can only think of Linux as a comparable community in terms of ww impact and success) should give a reasonable peace of mind in regards to being exposed to hacks or the likes.

SenatusSPQR,"Welcome to the Nano subreddit!

First off, nice to hear that the green aspect interests you. I personally find that rather important as well, and am glad to hear it attracts people. As to the points you made:

&gt; But I also see a lot of cognitive dissonance. Like claiming nano has more TPS than the big yellow coin. It's not true since layer 2 has basically unlimited TPS at maximum speed of validation (speed of light anyway).

You won't find many Lightning supporters here. There are many reasons for that, differing between people. My personal take on it is that it has quite some issues. In terms of security, there's the [Flood &amp; Loot risk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08513). In terms of scalability, there are just 7 TPS or so available on the base layer to open, upgrade, change or close channels. Even if there are ways to open more channels with the 7 TPS, it's hard to see this scaling to hundreds of millions of users.

Then there are the routing issues that it runs into if it ever gets big enough. The other option is that it becomes more of a hub-and-spoke system, which would solve many of the routing issues but leads to centralization and a lot of power with just a few hubs.

I personally have some more gripes with it, but let me not go into it too deeply, haha.

All that being said - I believe we could have a L2 solution built on Nano as well. 

&gt; Another thing making me uncomfortable is the ""limited supply"" which will never have ""new coins"" anymore. Is it possible to have any kind of privacy with such a system ? How ?

Correct, it's fixed supply. Why does that worry you? Privacy is roughly the same as in Bitcoin, it's pseudo-anonymous.

&gt; On the other hand, the ""fee-less"" part is really very very interesting. I still don't understand how it can work, but I'm digging. I will understand (do you have tips ?)

I'd humbly suggest my own article called [the Basics of Nano](https://senatus.substack.com/p/the-basics-of-nano-why-its-such-an). A lot of the more fundamental questions, like why Nano is feeless, are answered there.

Huge volatility, nothing really backing it up, it's just not really got any advantages compared to traditional currencies except in very specific edge cases - and those aren't used often enough to warrant the massive amounts of money in it. It's all just a gigantic house of cards predicated on people thinking it'll keep going up and up and up, and eventually.. there's just nothing there at the core of the biggest one, bitcoin.

Delam2,"The full article:

“The sceptics have plenty of fodder. The earliest adopters of bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, used it to buy drugs, while cyber-hackers now demand their ransom in it. Hundreds of millions of dollars of ether, another digital money, were stolen this year after hackers found a bug in some code. Many “believers” are in reality trying to get rich quick from the global mania that has seen the value of cryptoassets reach $2.2trn. Others are freakishly devoted. The entrepreneur who announced in June that El Salvador was adopting bitcoin as an official currency sobbed on stage, claiming it would save the nation.

The crooks, fools and proselytisers are off-putting. Nevertheless, the rise of an ecosystem of financial services, known as decentralised finance, or “DeFi”, deserves sober consideration. It has the potential to rewire how the financial system works, with all the promise and perils that entails. The proliferation of innovation in DeFi is akin to the frenzy of invention in the early phase of the web. At a time when people live ever more of their lives online, the crypto-revolution could even remake the architecture of the digital economy.

DeFi is one of three tech trends disrupting finance. Tech “platform” firms are muscling in on payments and banks. Governments are launching digital currencies, or govcoins. DeFi offers an alternative path which aims to spread power, not concentrate it. To understand how, start with blockchains, vast networks of computers that keep an open, incorruptible common record and update it without the need for a central authority.

Bitcoin, the first big blockchain, created in 2009, is now a distraction. Instead, Ethereum, a blockchain network created in 2015, upon which most DeFi applications are built, is reaching critical mass. Its developers view finance as a juicy target. Conventional banking requires a huge infrastructure to maintain trust between strangers, from clearing houses and compliance to capital rules and courts. It is expensive and often captured by insiders: think of credit-card fees and bankers’ yachts. By contrast, transactions on a blockchain are trustworthy, cheap, transparent and quick—at least in theory.

Although the terminology is intimidating (fees are “gas”; the main currency is ether, and title deeds over digital assets are known as nfts), the basic activities taking place on DeFi are familiar. These include trading on exchanges and issuing loans and taking deposits through self-executing agreements called smart contracts. One yardstick of activity is the value of digital instruments being used as collateral: from almost nothing in early 2018 it has reached $90bn. Another is the value of transactions that Ethereum is verifying. In the second quarter this reached $2.5trn, around the same sum as Visa processes and equivalent to a sixth of the activity on Nasdaq, a stock exchange.

The dream of a low-friction financial system is just the beginning. DeFi is spreading to more ambitious terrain. MetaMask, a DeFi wallet with more than 10m users acts as a digital identity. To enter a decentralised “metaverse”, a looking-glass world with shops run by its users, you link your wallet to a cartoonish avatar who roams around. These digital worlds will become the subject of intensifying competition as more spending shifts online. Big tech firms could impose huge taxes on these mini-economies: imagine Apple’s App Store charging fees, or Facebook selling your avatar’s intimate secrets. A better alternative might be decentralised networks that host applications and are run mutually by users. DeFi could provide payments and property rights.

Crypto-enthusiasts see a Utopia. But there is a long way to go before DeFi is as reliable as, say, JPMorgan Chase or PayPal. Some problems are prosaic. A common criticism is that blockchain platforms do not scale easily and that the computers they harness consume wasteful amounts of electricity. But Ethereum is a self-improvement machine. When it is in high demand the fees it charges for verification can climb, encouraging developers to work on minimising the intensity with which they use it. There will be new versions of Ethereum; other, better blockchains could one day replace it.

Yet DeFi also raises questions about how a virtual economy with its own norms interacts with the real world. One worry is the lack of an external anchor of value. Cryptocurrencies are no different from the dollar, in that they rely on people having a shared expectation of their utility. However, conventional money is also backed by states with a monopoly on force and central banks that are lenders of last resort. Without these, DeFi will be vulnerable to panics. Contract enforcement outside the virtual world is also a concern. A blockchain contract may say you own a house but only the police can enforce an eviction.

Governance and accountability in DeFi-land are rudimentary. A sequence of large irrevocable transactions that humans cannot override could be dangerous, especially as coding errors are inevitable. Money-laundering has thrived in the ungoverned grey zone of services lying between Ethereum and the banking system. Despite the claims of decentralisation, some programmers and app owners hold disproportionate sway over the DeFi system. And a malign actor could even gain control over a majority of the computers that run a blockchain.

Digital libertarians would prefer that DeFi remain autonomous—imperfect but pure. Yet to succeed it must integrate with the conventional financial and legal systems, as Gary Gensler, a crypto-expert who is America’s financial watchdog, has outlined. Many DeFi applications are run by decentralised organisations which vote on some issues; these bodies should become subject to laws and regulations. The Bank for International Settlements, a club for central banks, has suggested that govcoins might be used in DeFi apps, providing stability.

Finance is entering a new era in which the three novel but flawed visions of tech platforms, big government and DeFi will compete and intermingle. Each embodies a technical architecture and an ideology about how the economy should be run. As with the internet in the 1990s, no one knows where the revolution will end. But it stands to transform how money works and, as it does so, the entire digital world.”",hd49rfp,2021-09-17 04:40:49,296

TheBurdistheWurd,"""FOUL BEAST!"" bellowed a stranger at the cave entrance holding a rifle. ""Heh, I've always wanted to say that! *Ahem.* Anyway, *Dragon!* I know you have treasure here... Hand it over and there won't be trouble.""

The dragon, Feyus, stood and spun his massive bulk 180 degrees, knocking over the giant stone chair he was sitting in with a resonating *THUD.* ""How did you sneak in here, miscreant? I locked the entrance!""

""Yeah well, locks mean nothing to high-powered firearms,"" he said, pointing to his barrel. The man looked around the cave for the first time. ""Um...it's pretty empty in here. Where the hell is the gold?""

Feyus snorted, ejecting embers from his nostrils. ""I don't have gold, moron. It's 2021.""

""Bullshit, you're a dragon.""

""In 2021.""

The man lowered his rifle slightly. ""Well what the hell man? What is this treasure everyone's been jabbering about in the town? Dragons always guard good shit, and I want it. You have jewelry, or designer sneakers or Playstation 5's or something?""

""You aren't taking my treasure. Get out before your puny hide is charred."" Smoke drifted out of the corners of the dragon's mouth as he spoke.

""I'm a good shot, and I'm pretty agile too! Don't test me."" The man circled to the right, trying to get a peek at what seemed to be behind the creature.

""Like I said, my treasure is mine, you can't have it--and you won't take it."" Feyus lumbered forward, causing condensation to drip from stalactites with each step. ""Final warning, human.""

It was then the man could see. ""Wait a second, is that a desk and a laptop? What do you even hoarde?""

Feyus stopped. ""Bitcoin, NFT's...super valuable in the right markets.""

The dumbfounded intruder lowered his weapon. ""Well that's the most ridiculous goddamn thing I ever heard.""

""They grow in value with time.""

""Yeah maybe, who knows. But wow that's fucking stupid."" He started walking off.

Feyus clenched his fist. ""Yeah? Well check with me again in 15 years and we'll see who's laughing then!""

""I'm not interested in your damn treasure, weirdo.""

""Alright, well good, I don't want you taking my treasure! It's mine!""

""Fine then.""

""Fine!""

*""Fine!""*

""Go away!""

""Keep your door locked better next time!""

""Get out of my house!""

""I'm telling the town you have weird hobbies!""

""I will literally cook you, get the fuck out of my house.""

rainbowgeoff,"https://www.techradar.com/news/how-cryptomining-is-making-it-harder-to-find-the-graphics-cards-you-want

I was referring to crypto in general. The miners are causing a scarcity in the market which is driving prices up. According to this article though, bitcoin can be mined this way and many are doing so. 

&gt; The problem with that little factory we've built is that CPUs aren't designed to be workers in a factory, they're designed to be managers. Setting up the kind of multiprocessor system using CPUs like an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X to create a digital assembly line is very cost prohibitive.

&gt; A GPU, on the other hand, is precisely designed to be that kind of worker. In its essential architecture and operation, the GPU in an Nvidia RTX 3090 performs the exact same kind work as a computer's CPU. What's more, multiple GPUs can be run on a single machine to multiply its computing power, cutting into those duovigintillion (nice) or so seconds required to find the right ""guess.""

&gt; This is how you end up with the kind of mining rigs you see online where someone has a single tower case – usually open-sided – with adapter cables stringing together several or even dozens of graphics cards together in the backroom of some office somewhere.

&gt; You don't even need a desktop PC anymore to run everything. With the recent release of mobile RTX 3000-series laptops, even notebook computers are being incorporated into cryptomining operations in China.",hd7f5be,2021-09-17 22:37:59,62

\&gt;in line waiting to fuck this 10/10 chick  
  
\&gt;I was hand picked 3 years ago by herself

writing_genre,"Warren Buffett sat on the stage.

Today was a bittersweet day. It always was.

His back was killing him and some asshole was five minutes over time; talking about what a brilliant businessman he was. He didn't feel brilliant right then.

He felt like a fucking pig waiting to be slaughtered.

His mind ran through the last eight years. The shortest period for anyone to ever do the run from zero to ""winner"" of capitalism (well, if you didn't count that bitcoin jackass nobody could seem to track down). They were good years. He hoped his successor at Berk-5 would be able to keep it running this time. He thought he'd found a good man with Ajit, but after Sokol had wiped out Berk-3 in the Lubrizol affair...his faith in his ability to find honest men had been permanently eroded.

The speaker finished up, and another replaced him at the lectern. His first wife.

At least she was always kind.

He'd finally sold the house where he'd lived with his third wife for five years. They had divorced a couple years back.  It was rational, even though it hurt at the time.

No sense in taking them both out just because he would win. Again.

He'd rent this time. A house was a temporary possession anyway, and it was a drag on building any *real* wealth. He'd have to get a loan to furnish the place, but hell, if a five time winner of capitalism couldn't get a personal on a promise who could?

Though...last time B of A rejected him.  He put everything he had on the line, bailing them out during the housing collapse. A year before they rejected him he had *owned* half the company. Now it was run by some asshole who's main talent was being nephew to a boardmember of the charitable foundation run #4 had gone to.  His bailout of B of A was cited as the reason they couldn't bail him out.  He found it funny now, he'd tell the story at a burn-party if he could ever get himself to go to one again.

Everyone was looking at him.

Goddammit it was his turn to speak.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

After the speech he wandered down the busy streets of DC, wearing the towel he'd been given (his first new possession!) like some Greek philosopher in a toga. He'd be able to go pick up his five winner's badges tomorrow. He always got to keep those, they weren't worth anything.

He briefly considered going to one of the parties being held around DC. After all, they were supposedly in his honor. The real reason of course was to burn through enough cash so that none of the hosts would have the ""honor"" next year.

Enough wine and food would be wasted tonight to make the Romans blush.

He'd had more enthusiasm for it in his forties. Then he watched someone jump out of Van Gogh's Starry Night as an entrance gag and it soured him on the whole premise.

The man had called it performance art when Buffett confronted him. Warren was never a spendthrift, but that night he became so tight-fisted that he...

...well, that he'd become ""winner of capitalism"" five times.

He found a promising looking alleyway next to the offices of the Washington Post. In the morning he'd try to get a job as a paperboy. Hell, maybe he'd just stay one this time. 

He bedded down, anticipation for tomorrow was going to make it hard to sleep. There was something stoic about sleeping on the ground one night every decade or so. Starting over was hard, but it was honest.

The revelry on the streets was quieter here. They'd perfected bread and circuses in a way the romans couldn't hope to match.

Out of the corner of his eye Warren caught a flash. A man with a switchblade walked towards him, ""Your money or your life!""

Warren raised his head to look at him, ""I'm afraid your a few hours too late, friend.""

""This isn't a joke old man. Give me everything!""

Warren laughed.",hd9jxae,2021-09-18 07:49:44,1179

khanzarate,"In short, mining involves 2 steps. Some necessary bookkeeping, which is what we really want it to do, and a ""proof of work"".

The bookkeeping creates a block of data, which is linked to the block before that, which is linked to the one before that, so on, so forth. Multiple people might try to add a new block, and odds are, they're trying to commit slightly different new blocks, and, briefly, that means there are multiple block chains. 

Bitcoin is decentralized, that's the point, so if there's no central authority to ask, how do you determine whose block is gonna get to be the next new one? Proof of work. Whichever block chain was the hardest to make is the real one. This is why it's so hard to counterfeit, because every future block adds to the work done and a would-be counterfeiter needs an impossible amount of computing power, easily offsetting fraud profits with electricity cost.

This work is the energy waster, though. This work is how we prevent fraud.

No, using it to heat water won't break anything. Actually, nothing stops a company from doing exactly that, but that's recycling already-wasted heat. The question is, ""can this proof of work be itself put to work?""

Repurposing some algorithm that does something that is already worth money, though, opens Bitcoin up to fraud, because it's no longer a loss for people to try. Worst case scenario, you make money doing... Whatever it's doing.",hdbso15,2021-09-18 22:04:51,1400

FunnyMathematician77,"Basically the Blockchain is an ""encrypted"" (actually hashed) distributed database. This means anyone can add to or look up values from said database. How do you prevent people from adding fake data or changing already existing data? Bitcoin miners get rewarded to check the validity of records added to the Blockchain. But there is a problem, who is checking the miner's work? A nefarious miner could lie about a Bitcoin transaction and say everyone gave them all the Bitcoin.

The current solution is proof of work. This is where the waste comes in. A miner's computer must perform some operation that is inherently wasteful to deter any such behaviour from a single entity. Groups of miner's usually work together to verify a block (group of records) on the Blockchain. Every miner on the entire Blockchain network must come to a majority consensus (&gt;50%) on whether a new block is valid. This means a nefarious actor would need majority of the Bitcoin mining capacity to manipulate the Blockchain.

The Blockchain itself is actually remarkable technically. It just doesn't scale well. It is basically a publicly accessible tamper proof database. Bitcoin however, is a Ponzi scheme I'm convinced.",hdbyxts,2021-09-18 22:58:42,128

A117Z,"Constructing a Bitcoin transaction, and getting the network to accept it, costs virtually no energy whatsoever. What costs energy is grinding through the nuanced space to find valid blocks. Miners do this because they are compensated primarily with the coinbase reward of 6.25 BTC per block, which is defined in the protocol.  
  
As defined in the protocol, the per-block reward is cut in half every four years. This reduces bitcoin’s issuance rate and thus the miner revenue. So, in the long term, miner revenue from issuance will dramatically contract. As 88% of all coins have been mined already, mining is structurally shrinking, not a growing industry.  
  
Thus most of the miner expenditure – and hence carbon outlay – from Bitcoin is due to largely invariant coin issuance rather than any variable that’s correlated to transactional intensity. This fact invalidates the “energy cost of transactions” metric that critics like to promote. It is issuance that largely finances miners, not transactions. And because most coins have been issued already, Bitcoin’s future carbon outlay is likely to shrink.  
  
Therefore, comparisons to other payments systems such as visa systems should be met with extreme skepticism. Bitcoin is a full-stack monetary system with no outside dependencies; Visa is a small part of the U.S. dollar stack that relies, among other things, on 11 aircraft carriers patrolling the world’s oceans and enforcing dollar hegemony. Visa payments rely on a vast interconnected infrastructure of clearing and settlement. Bitcoin transactions are natively final and settle right away – they are more comparable to wire transfers. The energy exchange rate comparisons must take these differences into account.

MSRsnowshoes,"&gt; Most systems in cars are safety-critical and need to perform in practically every situation regardless of temperature, humidity, vibrations, and even minor road debris. With so much at stake, tried and true is better than new and improved. 

That's the other side of the Moore's Law coin. Validating new chips is expensive. While newer chips might be smaller and more power-efficient, testing and certification takes time and money. 

There's a reason mission-critical chips in military, aeronautics (including devices launched into space), and other applications run on old chip designs; (hell, Perseverence [uses a twenty-year-old](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAD750) chip) they're rated for hard use.

It's the ol' ""price, performance, reliability; pick two"" rule. 

I get jazzed about new tech too, but after having been in a couple of car accidents caused by others, I'd rather the chip(s) running the safety gear of my car not take a proverbial dump if it's too cold or simple road vibration damages them over time. 

I've noticed that the tech industry can display a surprising amount of hubris. I see it in app phones when people complain that battery life doesnt improve with more efficient chips or people complain about the increasing size. I see it in every laptop with glued components that has a poor repairability rating. Tesla, Uber, and others are behind their self-driving car goals. Bitcoin is exciting, but [electrically inefficient](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952). I wonder if this buy-our-newer-chips messaging is another example (it may not be, especially if newer chips can perform better and meet operational standards). Cars are already being treated like disposable appliances, to the detriment of buyer's bank accounts and the environment (when it comes to disposal), it'd be a shame to see them slide further down that path via chip failures.

To be fair, if chips of newer, smaller design can meet or exceed the standards of the previous chips at same or lower price points, I'm all for it.",hdhrt8f,2021-09-20 03:28:34,183

Bitcoin champions often talk about the people grabbing the power back from the rich and powerful. In reality all they're doing is changing who the rich and powerful are.

Highly volatile assets are literally a gold mine for people with a lot of money. They have the capital to exploit the market and win regardless of if it goes up or down. Meanwhile 99% of everyone else is at their mercy and are essentially doomed to lose money. The stock market has regulations against this that will protect the average investor to a certain extent. In the bitcoin world people can do anything, including everything that is illegal in the stock market. If you thought the stock market was rigged, going to bitcoin is literally like handing your money to the super rich of the world. 

Think about it, Musk was able to swing bitcoin prices wildly with some tweets. In the stock world that would be illegal and get him in a lot of trouble. All he had to do to make money off his own tweets was buy a bunch of bitcoin before he tweets to raise the price. Then sell a ton when he says something bad about bitcoin. And when that happens he could have shorted bitcoin and made a killing. In the bitcoin world where everything is anonymous, he could have done this with no one knowing it happened.

Dow is down 500 pts or so, on fears of Chinese economic/financial slump. Money will flood FROM chinese exposed stocks and funds.

That money could look for someplace to go that ISNT connected to that same exposure. Bitcoin is a globally traded currency now, unconnected to any one nation or national monetary policy. (We can still argue that it is deeply affected by regulation and monetary policy but indirectly).

Right now BTC is mirroring the dow decline because the same reaction is affecting its price - because many investors had previously looked at it as a stock equivalent. What if they discover that the dow tanks 2000 pts but BTC only goes down a few percentage points? They will recognize BTC as what it really will become - a digital store of value based on the entire world economy, with an enforce scarcity at approx 18 mil max coins.

The money fleeing exposed chinese markets might discover that BTC has a “purity” apart from any one market, and flood into it. 

The price at that point could be whatever you imagine the scarcity and global financial value could support. The worse the crisis, the more modest the BTC decline, the greater the eventual BTC price.

Ghost_carapace_0,"1. This is the biggest one. Avax has coopted metamask. Algorand and cosmos can't use metamask. Dot can't use metamask. Solana does not use metamask. This is important, because people looking for actual defi usage are going to hopping ship for a platform that uses a wallet they are already familiar with. Not only that, but its incredibly... friendly to have a single wallet that manages both your eth and your off chain addresses.... from a single wallet.
2. Second... listings. Avax is not listed on coinbase. Algorand, solana, polkadot have already been listed on coinbase. Coinbase will list avalanche sooner or later. Its simply not feasible for them to list shitcoins like shiba inu and then not list a coin like avax. The coinbase listing effect is a one time bonus pump that gives a project between 50-75% marketcap.
3. Third. Defi. Avax has a slew of defi projects from sushi to crv that have already opened or are opening their doors. With the large number of bridges, avax is shaping up to be a semi second layer tier of ethereum. But, avax has their sharding already done with subnets. Avax is everything ethereum 2.0 wants to be, but isn't as of right now.
4. Avax has a hard cap, burn fees for transactions, and staking. This might not matter with eth burning faster right now than its used, but if eth ever issues faster than it burns, avax will outcompete it.
5. avax staking uses lockups. This is incredibly important. It means that every single person who has bought and staked avax is out of the market until their stake is up. They literally gave up their ability to sell for anywhere from 1 month to 1 year. This is INSANE hodling, and this level of hodl is normally only seen with extreme bitcoin maximalists.

I believe you are misunderstanding the purpose of the bitcoin law and bitcoin's two biggest use cases in El Salvador. The 2 biggest use cases for bitcoin in El Salvador is remittances and being able to use bitcoin apps as a bank account. Around 70% of the citizens of El Salvador don't have a bank account and only around 7% of them have a credit card.

The purpose of the bitcoin law is not for the poor citizens of El Salvador to gamble their money investing in bitcoin. The purpose of the bitcoin law is to allow the citizens of El Salvador to transfer value between bitcoin and US dollars and spend bitcoin without keeping track of their cost basis and without paying any capital gains tax. The government of El Salvador is also trying to encourage tourists to come spend bitcoin in El Salvador and the government is also attempting to entice wealthy bitcoin investors to come move to El Salvador and spend bitcoin. The government of El Salvador is even offering permanent residency to anyone who spends 3 BTC on goods and services in El Salvador.

El Salvador has a very poor economy and remittances account for 23% of their gross domestic product. A very large number of the Citizens of El Salvador rely on money that is sent to them from their family members that are living in other countries. In fact, over $6 billion dollars was remitted to El Salvador last year. If their family members in other countries used bitcoin instead of scammy money transmitting services, then that would save them a lot of money.

Now the unbanked citizens of El Salvador have the option to use mobile apps like Chivo or Strike as a bank account. Their family members living in other countries can also instantly send them money for free by using Bitcoin and the Lightning Network, and using bitcoin wallets, exchanges, or just mobile payment apps like Strike and Chivo. Now they can use Strike like demonstrated in this 1 minute video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rt2C3CsLi7k 

Your government wants the citizens of El Salvador to be able to use Bitcoin as the value transfer protocol that it is. Salvadorans no longer have to pay any taxes on bitcoin gains. So now they can seamlessly transfer value between bitcoin and US dollars and spend bitcoin without keeping track of their cost basis and without paying any capital gains tax. Salvadorans will be able to pay any off any debts in bitcoin. They will be able to pay taxes in bitcoin. They will be able to send, receive, and spend bitcoin without having to keep track of cost basis or having to pay capital gains tax.",hdogh1y,2021-09-21 12:52:00,98

USA_DE,"I have always measured my wealth in terms of how long I can live without income. So right now, 1 BTC is about 1 year's salary, which is about 2 year's income after taxes (for a regular Joe).

If this hypothetical person is living within their means, then this gives 1 BTC a value of 2+ years of freedom. If you really know how to cut costs, 1 BTC could be as much as 4 years of independence.

So over the last decade, bitcoin has gone from granting an hour or two of freedom to giving years' worth.

Also don’t know what podcasts you’ve been listening to but most of the worthwhile Bitcoin podcasts are almost all aligned with Austrian Economic theories, not Keynesian. Ideal, sound money needs to both hold its value across time, but also needs to be able to be readily and easily spent when economic opportunity presents itself.

xzotc,"Your crypto holdings remain the same, you’re right. They are referring to the FIAT valuation. The following example will probably help:

Let’s assume you buy 1.00 bitcoin at 50k USD. 

A week later, the market crashes and 1 BTC is only valued at 40k USD. you still have 1.00 (remains the same, as mentioned). However, the BTCUSD took a 20% hit, right? (20% of 50 is 10k, so now we’re at 40k)

Now, let’s assume another week goes by and the market recovers a bit. By the end of the next week, the market is up 20%, **but it’s 20% from the closing price of the week prior, which was 40k USD**. 20% of 40k is 8k, so now BTC is valued at 48k USD. 

As you can see, the price dipped 20% and then gained 20%, but it didn’t retutn to the initial 50k USD price point, as it’s still 2k short. That’s because in order to go back from 40k to 50k, you would require a 25% gain.",hdro6mf,2021-09-22 06:26:35,85

liberty4u2,"Who in the hell is reading shitposts from 8 years ago?????  Fn Reddit.  I wake up to take a piss and I see multiple people having mentioned me in this post.  

I had forgotten that post but I remember distinctly hand writing my logic out on paper and doing “my simple math”.  Boy how the crypto world has changed since then.  It’s been a joy to watch it change and grow.  You guys have no idea how hard it was to get Bitcoin back when there was one exchange (mtgox). In fact that is part of how I knew Bitcoin would be successful.  

My very first purchase of Bitcoin required me to go to my local bank fill out a wire transfer form, pay a $50ish fee and argue with the personal banker AND branch manager that this “wasn’t a scam”. They were not going to allow me to transfer MY money to a bank in Japan. I had to threaten the withdrawal of all my funds to get them to do it.  This whole process took about an hour and cost $50. I thought to myself “how I the world are banks going to compete with Bitcoin when a similar transfer would take me 10-20 seconds to initiate and cost pennies to perform”. Btw I have tried to find the personal banker to see if they remember “the scam”.  I hope I find her some day. 

I learned almost every thing I needed to know about Bitcoin here on this Reddit. In fact bitcointip was popular back then and people would give you “small” amounts of Bitcoin just for commenting.  I figure I got about .74 Bitcoin given to me here just for commenting.   Thank you for educating me. Thanks to r/ancap for getting me here. 

Back to my original post.  I’m surprised how accurate some of my predictions have been. Last year I stood crying as I watched the Bitcoin ticker I have in my office cross $50,000.  I didn’t believe it would happen so fast.  Btw I’m still largely hodling. I sold some Bitcoin when it was zooming up above 50k to pay off my house.  The rest is in cold storage. 

My rant about how governments will try and shut down Bitcoin is just now starting to play out. I’m sure many of you have seen the proposed US regulations.  The bankers/politicians  will not give up their ability to print print print without a fight.  But if there is one thing I understand more clearly than ever it is that Bitcoin is freedom, it is liberty almost in its purest form.  It has to win or we will live in a draconian future.  Most people don’t know that we already have currency controls in place.  Large wire transfers have to be approved by a fed bank. You can’t carry large sums of cash on your person without the treat of it being taken.  Transfers of greater than 10k (?$600?!!!!) have to be reported to the government. 

The future of Bitcoin may require civil disobedience.  If you haven’t started a node you should. 

Where will the price of Bitcoin go in the future?  I think that it will be worth 10s of millions of dollars someday mostly because the usd is being printed into oblivion currently. I think it’s value will drop significantly as the world governments try and reign it in/destroy it.  But the day after they make it illegal it will still be there, it will still be working. When people see that the governments can’t stop Bitcoin with laws then they will flee their current fiat and use Bitcoin.

UnrulySasquatch1,"Wow, you brought some heated discussion from some very uninformed people.

Think of an upgrade like a baton pass. Miners lead up to the block of the PoS upgrade and validators take it from there. This is actually true of any upgrade. Normally the bottom is passed from PoW miners to PoW miners, but in this case the PoW miners can move on to other things after the upgrade. They are only responsible for getting to the block for the upgrade. Validators will take it from there.

Let's say Bitcoin decided to update to be ASIC resistant. (They wouldn't, but let's say they do). The ASIC miners would be responsible for getting to the block necessary for the upgrade and then the GPU miners would take over. Nothing else needed from the ASIC miners to proceed.

All that matters for the initial group is that they get to the upgrade block. They don't need to run some special code for the upgrade, just keep doing what they are doing. Then the validators pick it up from there and move forward as necessary. The second group is the group you need to be in sync with the upgrade.

The reason is because the entire community is in sync. If you and me and etherscan and metamask, etc, etc all decide that PoW blocks are Ethereum until block 13.5M and then PoS blocks are all that matters, then that's what will happen.

That is why consensus is law. If everyone (read: the super-majority) decides that the upgrade happens that way, then it does. Right now the community believes in the Ethereum foundation and the code they are creating, testing and releasing.

At any point, the community could decide against using their upgrades or use someone else's code. That doesn't seem likely in our current timeline, but could change if the Ethereum foundation stared acting outside of the community's best interest.",hdwy4my,2021-09-23 11:01:14,61

1. It's fake internet money backed by nothing
2. It's deflationary currency which discourages spending
3. It is wildly energy intensive
4. Network and gas fees for domestic spending
5. There are &gt;10,000 cryptocurrency alternatives
6. It is overly complicated for the average person to figure out
7. Using it requires internet access
8. Money laundering 
9. Intense day to day price fluctuations
10. Lack of a central authority means govts can't respond to economic crises 
11. Price of Bitcoin is too high (how many bitcoins does it cost to buy this Coffee at Starbucks? .00023?)
12. It doesn't solve a market need (95% of USD is already digital and free mobile payments are already available)
13. It functions more like an asset than a currency 
14. It is expensive and cumbersome for vendors to adopt and accept
15. It's a pyramid scheme 
16. It's a tax nightmare for consumers and corporations 
17. Financial services offered by conventional institutions are cheaper than those currently offered by crypto fintechs (loans, letters of credit, trade finance, leases, etc)
18. It is easy to send Bitcoin to the wrong address
19. Forgotten passwords/lost devices can lead to major losses
20. Exchanges and wallets can be hacked or go bankrupt",hdx8ua7,2021-09-23 12:32:51,102

saucy_intruder,"I'm going to answer this from a legal perspective because there's a prevalent misconception of what a ""Ponzi scheme"" is.  The short answer is that what you're describing is not a ""Ponzi scheme.""  In a Ponzi scheme, a person invests in a business and is paid at regular intervals with funds from subsequent investors.  A Ponzi scheme involves the investors being deceived as to the sources/legitimacy of the funds used to pay them.

Crypto currencies don't work that way. If you buy one bitcoin, that's it. You own a bitcoin that might go up or down in value, but you aren't being paid in cash with funds from subsequent investors.  The only way you get cash is by selling the bitcoin, and there's no deception or mystery about where that money is coming from. So crypto currencies are not a ""Ponzi scheme.""

That's not to say crypto currencies are a good investment; beanie babies weren't a ""Ponzi scheme,"" but they also weren't a good investment.  It's also not to say that the ""investment advice"" people give about crypto currencies is legal. What you're referring to is something more like a [pump and dump scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump_and_dump), where people artificially inflate the value of an asset with misleading statements.  That's much harder to prove than a Ponzi scheme. It's pretty easy to prove someone is lying about the source of a business's revenue if there's no legitimate business activity going on. It's much harder to prove someone is knowingly lying when they say, ""I think the value of \[madeup coin\] will increase 10%.""",he3qo90,2021-09-25 00:45:00,183
elveszett,"There's also one extra point nobody talks about: bitcoin being decentralized isn't necessarily a good thing. The US or the EU can manipulate dollars and euros to benefit their economies – the Federal Reserve, for example, continually prints or recalls money to make sure inflation is always positive and below 2%. It also prints money when needed to stimulate the economy if unemployment starts rising. These are powers that (used properly, of course) keep your country going.

Bitcoin's decentralization means that countries can no longer play with money to dodge crises or boost the economy. Unless you want to live in some anarchocapitalist dystopia, this isn't desirable.

Banks just dont have the ability or will to build scalable mobile/internet banking platforms for unbanked people. If you are transacting $100 a month, a bank just wont make any money by giving you internet banking access. Thus, millions of people in poor countries never have internet banking/banking access, since the banks dont deploy these features.

Bitcoin has all of this, and the operation costs are paid for by the network itself.",he99ppd,2021-09-26 04:37:45,55

PracticalAndReal,"Safemoon is another weird story. It's down over 90% from ATHs. The developers keep pushing this tech company narrative and it took them awhile just to push out the android wallet which is basic stuff these days. The price was falling coincidently and then they release the wallet and it pump and dumps 20%. Now its taking them awhile to push out the iOS wallet and wouldn't be surprised if that happens soon because its deja vu. Price dropping and they want to do another pump.

And if crypto decides to drop again many of these holders will lose another 90%. It's just he way the crypto cycles work with Bitcoin. It goes up and down and then up again. Safemoon definitely has the traits of a slow rug pull. The few developers on this know they'll make more money pump and dumping this until the end and probably make up some reason to trash the project. In this unregulated sector they can pull that off.

colindean,"This was made with [Gource](https://gource.io/), a repository change visualization tool. Each of the circles is a file or a directory in a collection of source code. The little person head figures are people making changes. The beam between the two is a change. A green change is an addition, a red change is a deletion, and a yellow change is a little of both, if I remember correctly. When you see a circle split, it means that it was split into another file or it was a directory that suddenly got a whole bunch of subdirectories.

It's a really neat tool for visualizing the work being done on a source code base similar to watching construction workers build a house. 

This particular visualization is very sped up so it all kind of happens in an instant. The last time I saw one that was about 10 years worth of changes was six or seven years ago when my employer was acquired and we watched a gource visualization from the beginning to then present at a rate of about 2 minutes per year. It's a lot of fun to see people come and make important changes or people who are really productive at either adding or deleting things.

Establishment_Fall,"I don't really post here much anymore because many of these crypto subreddits are full of people with little experience in the market. But for those looking at losses thinking about selling here is some advice from someone who has been in this market since 2015. 

1. Dont chase pumps, let them come to you. If you believe in a crypto and see the project going somewhere, buy and wait. If you are finding it stressful seeing \~90% losses, you will never make money in this market. People who hold long term are the ones that have historically done the best. 
2. Value does not go up monotonically. You WILL see losses, sometimes significant losses. its just an element of the maturity of the asset class. 
3. Dont marry an alt coin. You should never be fully invested in something like safemoon. Make sure you have bags of bitcoin, eth, ada, avax, chainlink etc etc. Projects that have stood the test of time. You are in crypto to make money, dont ape in on dumb shit without a plan. 
4. When you see parabolic rises of 10x-100x in a short period of time, you WILL see a blow-off-top' event where the price will crash down. This is because the selling pressure for all the people that got in early becomes too much and they take profits. Quick large rises = bad, gradual rises with tests of 8-20 week moving averages = good. 
5. When you see losses, zoom out and have a look at the rest of the market. When Bitcoin is at or below its 20 week moving average, alt coins bleed. New coins like safemoon bleed more. When bitcoin is stable and showing growth against its 20 week moving average, alt coins rally. At this point, the ENTIRE market moves with, or shortly after bitcoin. 
6. Look at what other projects are doing. If you look around the new binance smart chain eco system, projects are COPYING what safemoon is doing. I only just found another project today on ETH called SafemoonA. If projects are copying your project, it is a good sign. 
7. Something being good doesnt mean it will be immediately valuable. Look at Cardano, 12 months ago it was valued at .10 and now it is sitting stable at $3AUD. ADA has ALWAYS been a good project, but for 2 years it did almost NOTHING, it sat around .10 to .20. Be patient. 

90% of you will capitulate out of the crypto space because you dont understand how markets work or how value is attributed to asset classes. My final bit of advice is go and learn, find some clever people like Benjamin Cowan and absorb every bit of information you can. 

I am personally holding safemoon because it is an interesting project that others are mimicking, its a highly risky project that will likely fail, but there is a chance that it can succeed. So to me, that is worth a measured risk in my portfolio of lots of other crypto.",hejfotn,2021-09-28 10:04:24,40

coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; Bitcoin's price collapsed on Friday after a user tried to sell more than the market could absorb. The initial problem leading to the price collapse was that one user tried selling more than supply and demand for Bitcoin. However, it appears that this isn't the only problem. Bitcoins aren't secure, as both the recent theft and this password problem show. They're not liquid, nor a store of value.

ShinTsuki08,"The tulip bubble is mis-understood in popular culture.  It was a speculative bubble but it was a bubble in tulip futures/options.  And the futures were evolving within the legal framework they went from futures (obligation to purchase) to call options (option to purchase).  No one actually paid the high prices.  They just had the option to.  The courts did not enforce them as futures.  I believe one historian went looking and couldn't find anyone that went bankrupt over the tulip mania.

What popped the bubble.  Well the rarest multicolored tulips were due to disease and it was just emerging in the world.  That spring many, many more of the formerly rarest varieties were suddenly available.

It has very little bearing to Bitcoin.",hel6cvr,2021-09-28 21:34:23,48

paperraincoat,"You can run an analysis to see *exactly* how correlated Bitcoin is to the stock market, [Marketwatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/is-bitcoin-an-uncorrelated-asset-these-stocks-and-funds-boast-correlations-higherand-lowerthan-coinbase-11622826320) did this back in May of 2020.


&gt;Bitcoins correlation with the Nasdaq-100, as measured in late May, was around 0.20 on a rolling 20-day average, and its correlation with the S&amp;P 500 is 0.29, as of June 2, according to Dow Jones MarketWatch data.


&gt;The asset with the highest correlation to bitcoin, presently, is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC, at 0.81, meaning that the trust moves nearly in lockstep with the crypto.


If you look up 'how significant is a 0.2 correlation' on Google, it's pretty weak. The [general guidelines](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jt.2009.5) are: 


1. 0 indicates no linear relationship.


2. +1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship – as one variable increases in its values, the other variable also increases in its values through an exact linear rule.


3. −1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship – as one variable increases in its values, the other variable decreases in its values through an exact linear rule.


4. Values between 0 and 0.3 (0 and −0.3) indicate a weak positive (negative) linear relationship through a shaky linear rule.


5. Values between 0.3 and 0.7 (0.3 and −0.7) indicate a moderate positive (negative) linear relationship through a fuzzy-firm linear rule.


6. Values between 0.7 and 1.0 (−0.7 and −1.0) indicate a strong positive (negative) linear relationship through a firm linear rule.",hendmbn,2021-09-29 07:03:33,46

The customs people would then realize that they had no reason to search an international flight during a stopover, and apologize for the mistake.

In reality, of course, this guy is trying to scam money from you.  There is no flight, no gold or other valuables, he's probably not in Turkey, and he certainly isn't in jail.  He may or may not be a US citizen, but from his word choice I suspect he's not.

The idea is to get you to send money (via any of several kinds of irreversible methods, from Western Union to Bitcoin) to pay his fees, and he'll ""pay you back"" (probably double or triple) after he sells his gold in the US.  It's a variation on a very common scam.  You probably knew that, but I like to include it, just in case.  

I like how he worked in the ""no access to a camera"" thing to explain why he can't prove who he is, and the ""wifi only from time to time"" thing to explain his slow responses (likely because he's working more than one scam at a time.)

It has no added emissions but it requires to build facilities that do have an impact (concrete, turbines, etc).

If you want to scale the operation you need to build a proper energy grid with the losses it incurs. This is costly, perhaps prohibitively.

Equivalent_Office_67,"CKB is generated from 3 sources, 33.6 billion CKB was minted from the genesis block (of which 8.4 B were burnt at day 0 which was in November 2019) leaving a total of 25.2B to be in circulation. Of this, 19.8 B have already been vested and the remaining 2 vesting periods are in May and December 2022. No more of this type of issuance will be burnt based on the current plan.

The second source of CKB is from the mining, where a total of 33.6 B will eventually be mined, with halvings similar to Bitcoin (currently 4.2 billion coins are be mined each year, this will halve every 4 years (i.e. 2023; 2027; 2031....)).  This type of issuance doesn't consider burning.

The final source is from a secondary issuance of 1.34 B/year which is divided between miner incentives, and a DOA where CKB can be staked and you receive rewards equivalent to the inflation of this issuance, the remainder being burnt. Currently 80% of this secondary issuance has been burnt over the 2 year life of the mainnet. This number will reduce as the halving progress and the miner rewards from the POW mining reduce, also it will reduce by the amount of CKB stored in the DOA and locked up by Dapps (they have to buy CKB at a rate of 1 CKB = 1 byte to allow them the space to store smart contracts etc). Eventually some of the currently burned coins could be used for governance if the community are in agreement.

So to answer your, yes CKB will carry on to be burnt daily for a number of years to come, but there will be more coins created than burned so inflation will always be positive. However, the use cases of CKB locking up CKB will make this scarce if it is successful. 

In the Nervos Explorer there is a chart that shows the amount burnt historically which current sits at 10.1 billion CKBs:

It wasn’t until I met my college roommate (who I 100% owe a beer or really an entire bar of beers) in my freshman year who was the typical libertarian guy who convinced me to take Bitcoin more seriously. From there I started to read into ETH and found that the mission, technology and product was something I saw the potential in. I started to shore up my crypto holdings during the 17 bubble and especially post crash all through 18-19 a good size of my income was dropping into crypto. This was the hardest as everyone I know in life just completely gave up crypto and I was that loony still investing. 

Now I am in my mid twenties and crypto has given me the financial firepower to purchase a nice condo just outside of a HCOL city (which I’m so excited for! It’s a brand new build).

Mark_Bear,"Here's what I replied to it with:  

Bitcoin is not a Ponzi Scheme.
In a Ponzi scheme:

there is an ""operator"" -- a central authority (one person, or a small group), a swindler.

The swindler receives money from people

The swindler promises investors that their money will be invested in some business venture with an expected high rate of return. That money is NOT invested. There is no money-making business venture. Any returns are paid from the swindled money.

The entire Ponzi Scheme is based upon a big, fat lie.

The Ponzi scheme can only keep going so long as new suckers arrive to put their money into it.

A Ponzi scheme cannot survive a ""crash"".

A Ponzi scheme is illegal and immoral.

Bitcoin is legal, and honest.

Bitcoin has no central authority.

Bitcoin is purchased from other Bitcoin owners and/or multiple exchanges.

Bitcoin makes no promises about ROI.

Bitcoin is not, and does not pretend to be a ""money making venture""; Bitcoin IS money.

Bitcoin has survived several crashes.

Bitcoin can keep going without any new investors.

Bitcoin goes up (or down) in price because of supply and demand in a genuine market.

Bitcoin is based upon truth, verified by mathematics: its blockchain is an immutable public record of every Bitcoin transaction ever made.",hf51i5l,2021-10-03 05:29:37,253
KitsuneMori,"Bitcoin is an asset that is sold on the free market, which appreciates in value as the demand for it rises. In other words: a speculative investment.

A Ponzi scheme is when someone claims they will make a speculative investment **on your behalf** in an asset like Bitcoin, but **they actually don't**. Instead, they pocket the money and pretend to pay out a regular return by attracting new clients and using their ""investment"" money to pay off the old clients.

If you understood this, you would realize a ""Bitcoin Ponzi scheme"" does not involve any actual Bitcoin. Only the false claim that someone will invest in Bitcoin on your behalf when they mean to fleece you.

You can protect yourself by buying and holding Bitcoin directly.

Note as well that a Ponzi scheme is decidedly **not** early investors making a profit by selling to late investors. (Sometimes called ""greater fools."") There is nothing wrong with selling an asset for more than you bought it for **when the value of the asset has increased over time**. And neither is the buyer automatically a fool for paying the **fair market value** of a thing at the time he bought it.

You would probably lose part or all of your coins. That's why we often say in this sub the ""Not your keys, not your cheese"".

A few good wallet choices:

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets.

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for very small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix works on Android

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - Android or iOS, excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill or LN Pizza

[https://muun.com/](https://muun.com/) \- Muun, simple and elegant LN wallet - Android or iOS

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[https://trezor.io/](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're.

[https://coldcardwallet.com/](https://coldcardwallet.com/) \- ColdCaard is currently the safest and most recommended here.

There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend as not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, etc. Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different than the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. 



&gt;Same with ledger.

No worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

sarcastroll,"If a business can't afford to pay a living wage, then they have a fatally flawed business model. At that point they better acknowledge that they need government subsidies and/or other charitable assistance.

If I told you that my business model was to mine bitcoin and my assumption was that the price of electricity and hardware can be ignored, you'd laugh at me.  Either I was doing something illegal, or someone else was paying for it somehow.  But you'd know right away that my business model was flawed and my business would eventually go bust.

Same thing with, say, if I decided to get into the precious metals business.  My plan was to sell gold for 50% the wholesale cost.  That way I get a lot of business!  How could I sell so low?  Well, I'll just assume that I can get all the gold and platinum I need for free.  That way I can sell at 50% wholesale and make a fortune!

See, it's so easy to come up with a business that makes me a gazillionaire as long as I make up bullshit inputs!  The cost of human labor is no different.  You can't pay less that what it actually costs to *live* (living being as FDR described) as a human being.",hf845i3,2021-10-03 22:46:53,338

TheMeatery,"Several comments already pointed at how starting a post titled ""Bitcoin is Worthless. Change My Mind."" could be problematic. It might have sounded different in your head when you posted it, maybe even funny but let's break down your title when used the way it was over a medium where we can't see your facial expression or hear the tone of your voice:

1. ""Bitcoin is Worthless"" - that's a statement. You started by setting the tone of the conversation. Why might a statement like that cause problems? Well, you came into a sub of 3.4m people and offended some by indirectly stating their research, time, commitment and investments are worthless and that you know better. People here have spent considerable more time on this to ensure they protect their wealth and futures. It's condescending to make a statement like that.
2. ""Change My Mind"" - that's a demand. Now that you have evoked some kind of emotional response with your first sentence, you proceed to demand that we convince you otherwise. In principal many won't bother now, some will get angry and others will still try and convince you. You'll get a mixed bag of responses and likely draw more argumentative personally types into your thread.

You have to consider taking at least some responsibility of how your first thread turned out. The second thread called ""Groupthink is a Disease"" which is also now aimed at the subbredit collective isn't much better. Try to start without offending people first and you'll get better results in your threads.",hfa3rhn,2021-10-04 07:12:16,106

China is highly anti-immigrant, is a surveillance state that cracks down on dissidents, steals intellectual property constantly, and has simply peaked. No one wants to immigrate there, and they don't want you, but they actually need a massive influx in population. Their demographics of the previous few decades made them a powerhouse. Now, they are literally running out of steam. Quite literally, since something near 50% of their IC has or will receive blackouts this year. 

The fact the state is cracking down on videogames and bitcoin while also drumming up support for their wag the dog campaign to finally bring the Han Chinese Taiwan under the heel of the PRC is quite evident to me that China is well aware of its precarious position. It is poised to lose half its population, and soon. In two generations the place is going to be a ghost town, comparatively. Who will be the cheap labor they need to sustain their growth? These people don't exist. 

This is the most dangerous time. Yes, the US may be in decline (or not) but it's not plummeting off the world stage, we're slowly going down the steps in silken slippers.

First off what they are talking about isn't proper UBI, but a new type of gig work further ""gamifyimg"" the kind of digital odd jobs that Amazon Mechanical Turks is based around. 

Do you play any Gacha games? Like Genshin Impact or AFK Arena? They are based around a virtual economy model where you can pay to win by converting RL money to gems or whatever they call it.

The apes' big idea is for a new game (let's call it Anime Anti-feminist Objectification). In AAO you can convert those gems in to Dogecoin or something equally useless. Some versions of the idea for AAO have the infrastructure of the game being used to deploy a new block chain based currency usable for in game and RL purchases (a GemCoin if your will) and others have it using the game servers to create a massive mining operation where like 1,000,000 gems would let players buy a BitCoin. 

The Ape Company would still make money from AAO by using the standard industry tactics to promote unhealthy playstyles. Gambling, Subliminal Messages, ect. Then once the players run out of gems they can still get more by doing work like filling out surveys, participating in focus groups, reading native language text aloud, and categorizing datasets for AI development. 

But in theory some kind of UberChimp could exist who can just take their gems and run. Meaning in their marketing material The Ape Company will claim a responsible gamer will receive the equivalent of $5 a day or a $1500 a month ""UBI"" despite the game being just another casino.",hfhww6d,2021-10-06 01:41:23,106

backup2thebackup2,"very startup has an origin story, a tale that illustrates its core principles. For Wealthsimple, that meant promoting low-fee, passive investing.

After selling his first business about a decade ago, Wealthsimple co-founder Michael Katchen constructed a simple portfolio of exchange-traded funds using Microsoft Excel, then told the friends with whom he cashed out that this approach was the best way to invest their money.

The underlying premise: It’s tough to outperform the market over the long run, so for most people it’s better to invest in a mix of low-cost ETFs and ride the wave.

“The feedback I got from my friends was, ‘Mike, we’re lazy. We love the system, but can you just please do it for us?’ ” Mr. Katchen told The Globe and Mail in 2016. “And they became the first 10 clients of Wealthsimple.”

The concept proved popular with the millennial crowd, attracting billions of dollars in assets to Wealthsimple’s so-called robo-adviser, and the company went so far as to buy Super Bowl ads preaching “simple automated investing.” In no time, Wealthsimple had so much buzz that people started to wonder if it would take down Bay Street’s old guard.

Lately, so much of that seems like a past life. The company’s automated platform still exists, but Wealthsimple is now advertising a day trading app for retail investors. And it’s not just stocks – it is heavily promoting its new cryptocurrency business, which allows users to swap a slew of crypto assets.

The new strategy seems at odds with Wealthsimple’s founding principles, particularly so with crypto, which is highly volatile and has some of the highest trading fees around. In a recent speech, Gary Gensler, the new head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, called the crypto market the Wild West, “rife with fraud, scams and abuse.” China recently made all crypto transactions illegal.

Despite the hard pivot, Wealthsimple has said little about its change of heart. When asked about the new strategy, no one was willing to be interviewed. Instead, the company sent e-mails explaining that it is diversifying to target different client segments.

“Our mission is to help everyone achieve financial freedom, no matter who they are or how much they have. That mission hasn’t changed. We are a fast growing company building a full financial ecosystem for our clients across their savings, investing, spending, tax and crypto needs,” Mr. Katchen wrote.

As for crypto’s volatility, which prompted the SEC chair to call it a “highly speculative asset class,” Mr. Katchen does not believe that disqualifies it from inclusion in a well-rounded portfolio. Wealthsimple, he wrote, is “very comfortable recommending that our clients put their money in diversified, low-cost portfolios, while also supporting them if they wish to invest in particular companies or promising new technology.” He also said that Wealthsimple is the first crypto platform to be regulated by a securities authority in Canada.

What is happening at Wealthsimple is playing out in a similar fashion across the robo-adviser industry. Once-popular rivals in the United States, including Wealthfront and Betterment, are facing existential crises of their own. For all the billions of dollars that robo-advisers manage, it often isn’t enough to turn a profit. Betterment’s CEO stepped down last December, and its new leader acknowledged that an initial public offering likely was not possible until the company started making money.

“These businesses operate on very tight margins. They just have extremely low fees, therefore they have to achieve pretty large scale before they’re profitable,” said David Goldstone, head of research and analytics at Backend Benchmarking, which tracks the robo-adviser market, in an interview.

Even if a robo-adviser brings in tens of millions of dollars a year in revenue by charging around 0.5 per cent annually, the company has to spend heavily to attract new clients. “There was an industry-wide underestimation of how much it was going to cost to acquire customers,” Mr. Goldstone added.

Compounding the problem, the old guard woke up and launched robo-advisers of their own. In the U.S., Vanguard and Charles Schwab now dominate the market, with assets worth US$210-billion and US$60-billion, respectively, at the end of 2020. Betterment, the largest independent robo-adviser in the U.S., managed US$28-billion at the same date. In Canada, Bank of Montreal launched its SmartFolio robo-adviser in 2016, and Royal Bank of Canada followed suit in 2018.

The incumbents aren’t simply more competition – they have a structural advantage, because they can cross-sell their robo-platforms to existing clients, lowering their customer-acquisition costs.

To adjust, Wealthsimple started diversifying in 2018 with a high-interest savings account, then added Wealthsimple Trade, which allows users to buy and sell stocks. In the fall of 2019, the company acquired software maker Simpletax. And a few months later it launched Wealthsimple Cash, a hybrid of a no-fee chequing account and a high-interest savings account.

The pivot to crypto started in August, 2020, when Wealthsimple’s users were permitted to start trading Bitcoin and Ether. This past June, trading expanded to 14 additional crypto assets, including Litecoin and Dogecoin.

Wealthsimple does not break down its assets by division, but retail trading and crypto are what makes Silicon Valley salivate. Last fall, Wealthsimple raised $114-million in a funding round that valued the company at $1.4-billion. In May, it raised another $750-million, boosting its valuation to $5-billion only seven months later.

Retail trading app Robinhood and crypto trading hub Coinbase recently went public in the United States, and their financial statements illustrate just how explosive retail trading revenue growth can be, particularly in crypto. At Robinhood, crypto brought in US$320-million in the first half of 2021, compared with just US$10-million in the first half of 2020.

To understand what that could mean for Wealthsimple, simply look at the fee schedule. The company’s robo-clients often pay 0.5 per cent annually, while crypto traders pay 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent per transaction (although Wealthsimple must split that fee with other parties).

Stock trading and crypto are also popular with younger users, which has always been Wealthsimple’s target market but proved to be a tough nut to crack.

Even though the company attracted billions in assets, it was a tiny fraction of the total wealth-management market. Switching rates, which measure the likelihood that someone is willing to leave their main financial institution, remain stubbornly low. In 2020, management consultancy Accenture pegged the switching rate for a primary financial account in Canada at only 4 per cent.

Yet as the company grows, it seems inevitable that it will move further from its roots – some of which are still exposed on Wealthsimple’s website. In a section promoting its robo-adviser, the company writes: “History shows that when you try to predict the future – by picking stocks, for example – rather than investing in a highly diversified way, you are more likely to underperform the market.”",hfmykz4,2021-10-07 03:59:54,92

2. After proof-of-stake, there will be a “sell the news” event, a correction no larger than \~20-30%. 

3. Ether is headed to a long-term price range of $20,000, the maximum price between 2022 and 2023 will likely overshoot this figure due to speculation, new market entrants, hype.

Bitcoin is easily deliverable unlike precious metals so this makes paper bitcoin less valuable than paper gold or silver as there is no cost to hold, transport or secure bitcoin. 

The way this would be used to suppress the price would be to sell paper bitcoin creating a lower price to create arbitrage between spot bitcoin and the etf. This would cause selling of bitcoin reducing supply, this only works if there is significant liquid supply to sell. Eventually it would reach a point where all those willing to sell bitcoin for the dollar denominated profits run out of bitcoin.

SenatusSPQR,"Good post, thanks for doing this series. I think that, unfortunately, you based most of this off of the whitepaper, right? In Nano's case the whitepaper is terribly outdated, in several ways. For example, as far as I know Nano doesn't use UDP anymore. Some other small corrections:

&gt; In Nano's block lattice, each user account has a blockchain. These blockchains are responsible for maintaining the records of user accounts, while the main blockchain only holds a record of these ledgers. 

Every node actually stores all transactions so far. There is experimental pruning for non-representative nodes, but in terms of storage usage Nano isn't that much different to Bitcoin and such.

&gt; In the event of a conflict, the nodes with the right to vote - the result of using the delegated Proof of Stake - resolve the transaction.

This used to be the case in the earliest versions of Nano, but nowadays every transaction is voted on. Not just conflict transactions.

&gt; The best hot wallets for NANO are Exodus, WeNano, TrustWallet and Atomic Wallet. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger or Trezor is the right choice.

Exodus and Trust are quite terrible with Nano. Natrium is great, and www.nault.cc as well.

hipaces,"Not OP but my answer would be that Ethereum has concrete protocol upgrades scheduled over the next 6 months which will not only reduce issuance (which is what happens with Bitcoin's halvenings) but do a few other key things as well.  Here's what's going on with ETH:

1.  The Merge--when ETH goes from PoW to PoS, the ability to withdraw staked (and earned) ETH will not be enabled immediately.  Technically, issuance will still happen, it's just that stakers won't be able to sell their newly issued ETH.  This period shouldn't last for more than 3 months but there is a thinking that this ""in between"" period will further contribute to the supply shock.
2. Layer 2's are being rolled out--Layer 2 solutions on Ethereum are a key component for improved scaling.  They are already rolling out (Optimism &amp; Arbitrum for example) and more are coming.  So, unlike Bitcoin which is completely stagnant, the performance of the Ethereum blockchain is improving.  This can't be understated because it means more things can be done on Ethereum.  It's like when internet speeds became fast enough to support streaming video which allowed companies like YouTube &amp; Netflix to be created.
3. PoS is much more environmentally friendly than PoW.  This hasn't much to do with the actual blockchain, more just the social aspect of investing.  Bitcoin has come under scrutiny for its environmental impact.  When Ethereum goes to Proof of Stake, it will have a much stronger social &amp; environmental story to tell.
4. PoS itself rewards hoarding of ETH.  With Bitcoin, all you can do is hold it.  If the price doesn't go up, you're screwed.  If the price of BTC does go up, you're pressured to sell it because that's all you can do with it--buy low, sell high.  With ETH, holding it will earn you 4-7% (or more) ETH per year so there's an incentive to not sell one's ETH, even if it's price rises.

Hope that helps!  If you're interested in ETH, r/ethfinance is a good daily to check out.",hg0eecc,2021-10-10 03:40:16,124

Monero, of course, is just doing the same thing... only better.

New_Stats,"&gt; The Radical Center: The Future of American Politics, by Ted Halstead and Michael Lind, argued that America was ready for “political transformations and realignments” on the scale of the New Deal and Civil War, then proceeded to make the case for the “progressive privatization” of Social Security. For so-called radical centrists, the journey from revolutionary premise to cookie-cutter platitude is invariably a short one, which is why the book’s passages about “the rapidly emerging technologies and circumstances of the Information Age” would have sounded equally at home in your average Tom Friedman column.

I've done so much reading on NFTs and I've even tried explaining what I do understand to other people, and I still don't understand the core premise of ""what is it about this unique blockchain code that actually causes it (and/or its associated art asset) to have any intrinsic value""?  Because I still can't figure it out.  

Ultimately it seems to be another attempt at the success Bitcoin had in convincing people that their imaginary currency has value. This is the only way NFTs will work as a concept, and while it has worked for some crypto-currencies, the copycats have missed the boat and are just trying for some easy marks before they fold.

And the central banks and world governments have kept the masses (us) economically enslaved for decades through inflationary fiat. Bitcoin is the antithesis of the fiat system that the top 0.1% want to continue to use to control our lives, our time, and our energy. I’m relying on Bitcoin to be the primary tool for a financial revolution, because the days of armed revolutions are over. Governments these days are simply to powerful for their citizenry to overthrow them physically. It has to be done through monetary change. And I hope and believe that Bitcoin is the vehicle for that. If we can create a more financially free society with Bitcoin, then the opportunities for wealth building will be endless. The Bitcoin mindset drives ingenuity, responsibility, and learning. 

As far as lifting myself out of a low paying job, that will be a result of me finding ways to add more value to society through some type of skill. I’ve chosen the path of electrician, and will be beginning school soon. Most low paying jobs are only low paying because they don’t offer a valuable skill. Whether it’s college, trade school, or something else, I would encourage you to lift yourself out of poverty by learning and refining a specific skill. 

Yes, Bitcoin may lift us out of poverty someday. But that shouldn’t be your main plan. Build up your own life, and let Bitcoin do it’s thing. I have no doubt it will continue to explode. But we have to focus on building up our own lives in the meantime.",hg9rver,2021-10-12 05:28:05,150

What I generally try to do is research whatever company/individual I'm contacting a bit and try to make it clear how Nano could help them, rather than how they could help Nano. I'll add some examples, maybe they're of inspiration to some.

-----------

To Bitpay:

Hi xxx,

Hope it's okay to email you here. I'm messaging because I admire your service, and would love to see Nano added to the payment options. Not only is it the top request on your requests page (https://bitpay.canny.io/feature-request), but from being a rather active member of the Nano community I also know there are countless businesses looking for easy ways to integrate Nano payments (since it's genuinely meant as a payment cryptocurrency). I feel like there's a win-win here, with Nano's huge community willing to spend and many merchants looking for a solution.

It also seems like a good one for Bitpay to integrate as transactions on the Nano chain are instant and feeless, so settlement risk is far lower than with other coins.

If there's anything I can do to help, or anything more we as the Nano community can do to show how much we'd love for BitPay to add Nano, please let me know.

Kind regards,

To a journalist:

Dear xxx,

I'll try to keep this short. A fair bit has been written on the environmental hazards of Bitcoin investment. I feel like many stories are missing the main points, which in my opinion are two-fold:

* Every bit of investment into Bitcoin increases Bitcoin's price, and thereby increases emissions. A higher Bitcoin price = more profitable mining = more miners joining = more emissions.
* There are alternatives to Bitcoin that offer superior utility, and are green at literal orders of magnitude less energy usage.

The way I see it, this means that anyone investing in Bitcoin, be they individuals or institutions, is actively contributing to increasing emissions. I find this rather unforgiveable, because even if you believe that cryptocurrency offers value to the world (which I think it does), Bitcoin is a worse solution.

For more information, not just on Bitcoin's energy usage but also on alternatives such as Nano that offer this increased utility with far lower energy usage, see for example https://senatus.substack.com/p/the-environmental-idiocy-of-bitcoin-investment-8c5cd36f802a and https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/3/17/climate-concerns-to-crime-bitcoins-dark-side-draws-scrutiny.

I see this as a rather clear-cut case where we can cut a lot of emissions, and I think it'd be interesting to read a piece that points out how investing in Bitcoin contributes to emissions, and perhaps quantifies the effect of divesting from Bitcoin into Nano. Even if just a small percentage of investors see the idiocy of this, given the large total emissions of Bitcoin this would already have a noticeable effect in terms of decreasing emissions.

Either way, thanks for hearing me out.

Kind regards,

To the Woz (Steve Wozniak):

Hi Steve,

First of all, great fan. Not just of the tech you've built, but of the way you approach life. I also love the way you approach philanthropy, and what you've started with Efforce. With that out the way, let me explain to you about a way I think you can further help better the world, at very low cost and effort to yourself.

As you're well aware, crypto is here to stay. Unfortunately, some crypto such as Bitcoin have a massive footprint and negative effect on the world. A recent Nature papure found that Bitcoin's emissions alone could push global warming above 2°C - https://nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0321-8. There are many more articles like this one. To put this into a relatable perspective - a single Bitcoin transaction equals ~3000 miles of electric driving. A round trip from London to Amsterdam, by plane, doesn't emit half as much CO2 as a single Bitcoin transaction does. Yesterday, there were 350,000 Bitcoin transactions.

If Bitcoin was adding massive value, it might even be worth it. But it isn't. It's got $10+ fees and long waiting times, so no one is using it as currency.

The way I see it, we can, in your words, ""improve our energy footprint and lower our energy consumption without changing our habits."" I think that this really hits the nail on the head. People don't want to give anything up. Electric cars are only now getting good enough for people to see them as a realistic substitute to ICE cars.

I think that in crypto terms, Nano is this improvement. It's able to do whatever Bitcoin does, but about 1000x better. It scales better, it's feeless (by design), transactions are confirmed instantly, its initial distribution was done by giving it away for free, and most importantly for this email - it's very energy efficient. See also this article: https://senatusspqr.medium.com/fight-the-climate-crisis-usenano-6e7c22d45b0e.

So why do I email you about this? I think that someone with your standing looking into Nano and speaking about it positively would mean the world. It would legitimize it far more as an alternative to Bitcoin, meaning more people will use Nano and hopefully less of Bitcoin. This literally directly impacts CO2 emissions.

To look into it - you can try it for free by getting a free wallet from the app store (Natrium recommended) and grabbing free Nano from a faucet (like https://freenanofaucet.com/). Takes under two minutes. To read more about it, there's https://docs.nano.org/what-is-nano/overview/. Alternatively, while I'm not actually part of the Nano team (just an enthusiast) I'd gladly put you in touch with Nano's founder, Colin LeMahieu.

Anyway, apologies for the email out of the blue, but I think it's incredibly important that people around the world have access to a self-sovereign currency but even more importantly, to do whatever we can to save the planet.

All the best, and keep on being the awesome dude you are.

Kind regards,

xxx

The Giving Block:

First off - fantastic initiative you have set up. I love what you guys are doing, props to you. The reason I'm contacting is because I'd love for you to add Nano to your crypto donation options. The reason for this is that Nano is morally strongly aligned with the goals of the Giving Block, and offers feeless + green transfers. Whereas Bitcoin has rather high energy usage, Nano barely uses any energy. See https://nanoportal.cc/ for more info on it. Nano was given away rather than sold/mined, and still today is often given away (mostly to people in Venezuela, Nigeria and such) by the community.

In other words, I believe Nano fits with the spirit of the Giving Block very well. The community would love to be able to donate to for example CO2 reduction charities because most people in the community feel strongly about this, and being able to do so in Nano would be fantastic.

I'm just a community enthusiast who believes secure, feeless and green money is a fantastic thing to have in the world. That being said, my technical knowledge is limited. I'll therefore add the email for the Nano Foundation (a non-profit) who can help integrate Nano, in case you're interested: partners@nano.org.

Thanks for your time, again thanks for the good you are doing for the world, and I hope this message was worth your time.

Kind regards,

At full power, the gas turbine runs fairly clean assuming you have the right equipment.

DrWednesday,"Surprised no one has actually pointed out what JD is talking about here:

The point is that once halvings go down to zero, there will be no more block rewards and the income for those securing the network will be entirely due to fees. 

If there aren't enough fees to keep miners in business, then they leave the network and security falls, which is bad for everyone.

If this happens, the miners might just decide to fork bitcoin, remove that hard cap code, and continue block rewards. Because it could have the majority of miners/hashpower, the chain with &gt;21 million BTC might actually be the more secure chain. 

No one can change the cap on the current chain, but remember, there are thousands of bitcoin forks and if consensus moves to one with no hard cap (ie it follows the block reward money), then there is no longer a hard cap.

Seriously just ignore those people, we need every single positive dogecoiner if we want to see dogecoin's positive potential realized.

pseudoHappyHippy,"Unfortunately I need to add a dash of doubtium to this juicy hopium.

So, first of all, I agree with the general premise that BTC growth is best described in logarithmic space, and that there should exist some logarithmic band that captures BTC's oscillations. This band should have a convex (getting less steep) curve, which you can see quite clearly in any logarithmic representation of BTC like the rainbow chart above. That is a more mathematical way to say each cycle has diminishing returns, which is a generally accepted fact at this point. So far, so good.

Here's the thing:

The exact shape of the logarithmic regression bands is arbitrary. What I mean by that is that the width and steepness of the bands is controlled by arbitrary parameters, and the only reason the rainbow band looks the exact way it does in ""the"" BTC rainbow chart that is always cited is that the person who first made this chart tweaked those arbitrary parameters until the logarithmic band they produced was as close of a match to the BTC price history channel as they could get at the time.

Looking at the rainbow chart with the advantage of hindsight, it looks like the parameters could use some tweaking to fit the data better. Specifically, note how the top of the 2017 cycle perfectly reached the top edge of the red band, while the 2013 cycle goes above the red band. Because we're in logarithmic space, that little spike above the red band actually represents a **doubling** in price. I believe that the first ever BTC bull run in 2011 that is not included in this graph goes even higher above the top edge of this particular log regression band than the 2013 one.

What this means is that the entire logarithmic band (the rainbow) is not curving down hard enough to reflect historical reality. In other words, this famous old rainbow band was too optimistic about the severity of the diminishing returns phenomenon. 

To re-fit the logarithmic bands so that both 2013 and 2017 reach the top of the red band, we would have to adjust a parameter that makes the entire logarithmic rainbow more convex (flatten out faster), which would curve down future price projections for the whole rainbow.

Instead of doing that complicated set of calculations right now, let's use a quick heuristic to create a second projection to balance yours out.

By quickly eyeballing it, it looks like the 2013 top went about two color bands' worth above the top edge of the red band. Since 2017 went to the top edge of the red band, it went about two bands less high than the 2013 top. If we extrapolate, we could predict that this cycle will reach two bands below 2017. With this assumption, we should expect this cycle to peak at the top of the 3rd highest band. If we follow your assumption that the peak will come in mid-December, then this heuristic puts the peak at **$100,000**.

Another way to put this is: imagine we widened the bands so that the 2013 peak reaches the top of the red band, rather than going above it. In such a scenario, expecting the 2017 cycle to reach the top of the red band would be a prediction of $38,000 BTC in 2017, whereas it only reached $19,000.

Now, I'm not saying that my projection here will be any more accurate than yours. Who knows. In any case, logarithmic regression bands are just one of dozens of useful heuristics for gauging Bitcoin cycles. Their particular curvature is just determined by the parameters chosen by the person graphing the curves. This particular log regression band chart happens to be quite famous, but also too optimistic about rates of return by a factor of about 100% per cycle (at least according to the historical data it is trying to fit).

As for your secondary point where you simply project the 343% gains of mid-Oct to mid-Dec 2017 onto the current situation: this projection ignores diminishing returns. It is a mistake to assume that the % gains of one cycle will be equal to that of the last. Every crypto cycle (granted, this is just the 4th) has seen significantly diminished returns. 

If % gains from one cycle to the next were constant, then logarithmic bands that capture BTC oscillations like the rainbow chart above would all be straight channels aiming up and to the right, with no downward curve.

Here are a few quick numbers: 

The 2013 peak was a 40x over the 2011 peak, but the 2017 peak was only a 16x over the 2013 peak. 

The 2013 peak was a 552x the previous cycle floor, but the 2017 peak was only a 97x over the previous cycle floor.

Anyways, my point is that diminishing returns are a fact, and they are very significant, making your linear projection invalid.

BTC might make it to $197,500 this cycle, I don't know. The cycle also might get rejected at 100k, or even lower. In any case, don't get too drawn in to any one heuristic. They are just that: heuristics.

In the end, this is just a rainbow that someone painted with some math, and they didn't even paint inside the lines too well.",hgn55b3,2021-10-15 03:36:37,498

&gt;I hear how gold and perhaps bitcoin are “hedges against inflation”, but never hear a logical theory behind the claim.

As far as more ""active"" hedges go, you want goods that rise in value when inflation goes up. A lot of commodities work fine for that.

&gt;I could borrow $10 million, buy all the cool stuff that I would ever need for the rest of my life, and when repayment comes due, the hyperinflation would mean that I would be paying back almost nothing. But I still have all my cool stuff.

*If* you can find a loan with a fixed interest rate, or at least one that isn't able to grow in interest enough, sure.

The caveat being that actual hyperinflation wreaks havoc to the entire economy, including your income and the supply of goods and services. Now you have a mansion and ten cars, but there's no gas to buy and you don't have the income to pay your electricity bill.",hguuyvo,2021-10-16 22:14:28,82
greenskeeper-carl,"You guys really need to learn how trading and hedging works. Some of this is embarrassing. “Hedgies shorting get rekt hahaha”. A lot of these shorts getting closed out are just large institutional entities who open up short positions as a hedge against a crash, even if they are net long Bitcoin. To you and I, a few million dollars on a short position looks like a ton of money, but you have no idea what the rest of their trades look like, they could be long 3x more positions that short. 

These entities take short positions even if they believe in Bitcoin going up to protect them in case of a crash. They open up these positions expecting/hoping these positions will go to zero because they are net long. You guys really need to take a little time and learn how that works.",hgv14xt,2021-10-16 23:09:28,1891

And honestly, I have not seen a single game with crypto integration that isn't complete garbage and just looks like a cheap money grab.

Actual crypto/NFT integration will not be ""investments"". It will simply be a new way for players to own items they get in games and trade them with other players.

So I can completely understand Steam banning games with crypto for now. They will have to first work on some rules of what kind of integration even makes sense before letting every scam project on their platform.

I was too young to invest myself but I had already convinced most of the local psychic population to do so, the rest were faking their powers and couldn't really see the future. It wouldn't stop the messages, I would not invest even if I could because I thought that would cause a paradox.

I considered the message again, obviously my future self had been captured. Hopefully others will be able to fight back and they will be rescued. Actually I knew they would because they had dated the message earlier than the others - possibly they had not discovered that Bitcoin was theirs yet.

I think the timeline must have been affected and these are probably all coming from different ones. I wonder if these technology companies which I understand are giants will still be in this one.

Tijok,"\[From an [established work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilith%27s_Brood), this is an AU timeline, just having fun\]

I still remember how the bark lanced into my palms as I pushed up off the ground, the swingset and slide reassuring me that I was back at Huntington Elementary. I recall being baffled by the notepad in my hand, and the pencil in the other. I can still feel the fear as I realized I had no idea what had happened for the last (as I learned later) four minutes, or how I landed on the ground beneath the maple tree. The tears come just as easy today as they did twenty years ago when that terror comes back. I still fight it down as I did then, never wanting to show just how strange this - I... was.  
  
Of course, it's a lot easier to be strange now. After following the directions on my notepad to ""invest in Yahoo, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Bitcoin"", here in 2021 I am no longer weird, I'm wealthy enough to be eccentric. I've known the message wasn't a figment or a siezure since the $121 dollars my dad begrudgingly invested in Yahoo's IPO became $1,273. Of course, that one went a little sour later, perhaps the Yahoo of my messenger's future did a bit better.   
  
Either way, I never told anyone about the second part of the message, the part from a future I am determined not to see, ""Spend on defense. They do not come in peace."" I've also never forgotten about it, so when Twitter erupted with live video and images of the massive dropships being met by government officials from around the globe, I knew that it was time. While the forests growing from the top of the ships swayed as helicopters inspected them, and Presidents, Kings, and Prime Ministers shook hands with tentacled visitors, (with varying levels of comfort) I locked down my perimeter and put security on high alert. When the joyous cries that the Oankali, ""were here to trade, and respected life above all else"" echoed across TikTok, I knew that my preparations were only going to be the beginning of what I needed.

radagast_the_owned,"Even if you ""know"" a big crash is coming, the fact that you don't know when makes waiting for the crash a bad idea. I'm sure there are boomers that sold at the bottom of 1987 and waited to no avail. 

Let's say you want to buy the dip. Okay, what are you going to hold onto?

\-Holding cash when inflation is hitting 5% is a bad idea. Four years like this and you're down 20% for a dip that might not happen. 

\-Fine, so you hold bonds in order to get a better return. Not only do they get reamed by inflation, when rates go up bond prices will collapse. 

\-Oh yeah, well I'll put it in real estate. Locking in 30 years of bottom dollar interest rates might not be such a bad idea. But the flipside of low interest rates has been very high list prices. If rates go up, house prices might not do so well. And well, a lot can change in 30 years. A house in Detroit probably seemed like a blue chip buy in 1960. I'm not sure it looked so good by 1990. 

\-Okay, so I'll hold gold. Well, GLD is already up around the peak it hit in the 2008 financial crisis. And even if gold is a traditional safe haven, it might not fare so well against rate hikes, which are deflationary (Volcker wasn't so great for the Hunt Bros). 

\-Oh yeah, well I'll hold bitcoin so I can be a super-billionaire when it crushes fiat. Well, a lot of holders of crypto are highly leveraged. Rate hikes won't be so great for that. And crypto has tended to be pro-cyclical not countercyclical, despite notions that it is some kind of digital gold.

SethEllis,"Bitcoin investors are more likely to use and believe in technical analysis.  They believe that the history of price contains all known information to the market about the asset.  Increasing price is proof of crypto viability in their minds.  The problem with that is that markets are not informationally efficient at all.  Orders move price, and those orders don't always have informational content behind them.  This makes price an extremely poor reflection of all currently available information.  


So in this case price is being moved by orders that are backed by Tether.  As long as Tether keeps printing, price is likely to push up.  That gives us almost 5 years of price action that is essentially all based on fraud.  In fact, we've never really seen a solid bull market in Bitcoin that wasn't been driven by fraud of some sort as the Mt Gox bull was driven by money printing too.",hhdrm6o,2021-10-21 01:57:01,72
Etony333,"With Bitcoin making a new ATH today, there are probably newcomers who are checking out the scene and looking for advice. So, here goes.

First of all, cryptocurrency is not, despite what you may have heard, a get rich quick scheme. It certainly does happen that way sometimes, but the majority of the time, it takes a while. Read up on what Bitcoin actually is and how it works to give yourself a better understanding of what makes it superior to centralized systems.

You need discipline. Lots and lots and lots of it. This is a very volatile market, and double digit swings in either direction are commonplace, often in the same week or even the same day. 

The exact same emotion that causes you to buy due to fear of missing out also causes you to sell for a loss when the market tanks. Hard as it may be, you should really try to avoid this. It is imperative to make a plan and stick to it. Even those who have been doing this for years have difficulty with that, especially when it comes to taking profits.

There's often a purpose to the market swinging one way and then the other. Since liquidity on exchanges is often rather low, those with the means to do so often try to push the market one way and then the other in order to hit people's stop losses. Not that you shouldn't remain vigilant when big swings happen, but you should never panic because of it. It often quickly reverses.

Until you know what you are doing, I would advise against trying to trade. The person buying when you sell and selling when you buy often has a lot more money and a lot more experience than you do, and trading is a zero sum game. The safer option is simply to buy and hold. Paper trade if you'd like, and compare it to how well you're doing by hodling. Chances are, you'd be worse off by trading. Revisit it when you have more experience.

Finally, and the most important point of all: do NOT invest even one penny more than you are entirely comfortable with losing. The market looks great right now, and maybe it'll stay that way. But maybe it won't, and you do not want to be missing rent payments or losing your collateral because the market took a downturn. Assume that anything you put in is gone on the off chance that it is.

Glad to have you aboard, and I hope you'll stick around even during a bear market. Those who invest heavily during a bear have never regretted it if they kept their investment in.",hhdwdph,2021-10-21 02:28:24,116

Here is today’s chart:  https://imgur.com/gallery/C3p2kBY

The formation moving upwards throughout October was steady and looked very positive.  Over the last few days it obviously shot upwards.  We had two high pole warnings in short order.  This morning we reversed back and touched the first reversal point.

The second, unresolved HPW is at $58,514—which is also the local breakdown target.  So hold on…it would not be unrealistic to go down to the second support level at $56,231.

After the launch of the fastest growing ETF, this should have been expected.  If nothing else we have seen significant growth in a very, very short time.  Taking some time to cool off is OK.  I wouldn’t be freaking out at this points.

Here are the numbers:

The formation is only 2 columns wide.  This is a tentative breakout at best.  We need to see some consolidation at this $62k+ levels.

We reversed and have taken out of the most recent High Pole Warning reversal point.

The breakdown price is at $58,514.

A breakout would occur at $67,261.  This is a very wide range.  Expect instability—either way.

Local support is at $59,690—so holding $60k looks good for now.
Second support is at $58,514.

The trend line is at $42,557.  This is 39 boxes below the box for today.  

That's it.  I hope to be posting a bit more often.  

I hope you all made more money during my absence.  (Holding would have proven lucrative!)   This weekend is when Evergrande should officially enter into default*  I cannot help think that this will have an impact on overall markets next week.  It will be interesting to see if there is any movement into bitcoin.  (I know that won’t happen in China…but stranger things have happened.) 

* Zero Hedge had an article yesterday about what is happening and how it might impact CCP policies and whether it would likely spill over into other markets.  My take is that the CCP will save the day, and this problem will be kicked down the road.  Central Banks do stuff like that.",hhigf58,2021-10-22 02:07:55,170

CalligrapherOneTwo3,"You are obviously very new to crypto and so I will give you a quick summary of the basics. In short, no, you will not own real crypto with WealthSimple. Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage wallets, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:  
  
1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montréal which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can easily confirm their legitimacy and I have been stacking free Satoshis for a few years now.     
  
2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them ""offline"" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.  
  
3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy BTCX, ETHX or BTCC in your TFSA. With that said, you do not truly own crypto with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not the asset itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: ""not your keys, not your crypto"". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not completely insured. Big risk, but tax free/deferred in a TFSA/RRSP.  
  
4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold ""entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga"" while Quadriga held the ""keys"" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of ""not your keys, not your crypto"" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.  
  
5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, ETHX, and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the ""keys"". They are the ones who own the real asset (crypto) and simply run the fund with the crypto backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).  
  
6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the crypto-asset, it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your adjusted cost base (ACB) for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your ACB for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.  
  
7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really crypto itself, but rather, it is in the application of blockchain technology which serves as a massive global public ledger as well as the decentralization of this digital store of value combined with its independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the crypto-assets itself simply have a monetary value relative to fiat currency. Moreover, investing is simply risk management and from a risk-adjusted returns perspective, having some excellent crypto-projects is better than not having any at all while I personally see this as the 12th sector in the overall global market index.  
  
Now, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:  
  
1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its ""blockchain"".  
  
2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a ""key"" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this ""key"" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word ""seed phrase"" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word ""seed phrase"" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word ""seed phrase"" is essentially your ""keys"" to your assets on the blockchain.  
  
3. Your 24-word ""seed phrase"" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word ""seed phrase"" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your ""keys"" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin.   
  
4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word ""seed phrase"" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word ""seed phrase"" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your ""keys"". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your ""keys"", never give it out. Period.

noduhcache,"Alright.  Litecoin is an infrastructure machine over its entire life.  Phase one was external infrastructure to bridge the gap between the old world and new world, exchanges, payment processors, trusts, brokers etc.  The most recent add was Interactive Brokers.  Grayscale wants to convert its litecoin trust to a spot etf.  Paypal, venmo, bitpay, verifone, newegg and amc are all recent adds that many investors missed because headlines at rcc and twitter often omit when litecoin is added, but the liquidity is still there across virtually all crypto infrastructure that exists.

The next generation of infrastructure is lightning.  Coffee is just an early liquidity start for lightning, it's not the endgame.  Someday the whole world will transfer wealth round and round, consumer to business, business to business, country to country across lightning with settlement to bitcoin.  As litecoin shares the same lightning network and value can seamless swap between bitcoin and litecoin it can act not only as overflow in peak settlement periods, but also protect against spam attacks and even reach mutual security reinforcement with bitcoin since to take down the lightning system would require a successful attack on both underlying networks to bring anything down.  

On a lesser note, litecoin's adoption of MWEB alongside it's 2nd layer lightning connection to bitcoin gives bitcoiners potentially seamless access to confidentiality, litecoin, bitcoin, lightning and MWEB pegs could all be packaged in a single wallet so value could be transferred and protected with one touch.",hhkakm9,2021-10-22 10:01:35,213

Chart for Today:  https://imgur.com/gallery/atECaiD

So we continue to move downward.

The key numbers haven’t changed from yesterday.

Because of the drop we re-joined the previous formation, making it four columns wide.  This means more stability long run.

The important numbers to watch today are the local support which is in the $59,560 box right now.  In a perfect world we should bounce around there.

The second second level is $58,514 box.  That is both the breakdown point AND the unresolved high pole warning reversal box.   That could be a point where things happen.

None of this is an exact science.

Much of this appears to be profit taking from the ETF announcement.

In other news Evergrande was able to “scrape up” enough money for their coupon payment, so the danger of default was averted.  Some relief from potential problems might be in play.

Delicious-Ad-3552,"Bitcoin address balance works on the principle of UTXOs or Unspent Transaction Outputs. A UTXO is basically a TRANSACTION OUTPUT that u can spend. 

If u have 100 bitcoins and want to send me 5 bitcoins, under the hood, ur wallet sends me all ur 100 Bitcoin, I keep my 5 bitcoins and I give u back 95 Bitcoin as a UTXO or change.

This is why for a Bitcoin transaction from one wallet to another, there is 1 input and 2 outputs. The input being the senders wallet address and one of their UTXOs. The 1st output is the receivers wallet address and the amount of bitcoins u want to send them. The 2nd output is the address of the senders wallet where the “change” of the transaction is sent. This 2nd output is the TRANSACTION OUTPUT that the sender can use to send bitcoins in their next transaction.  

Now u might think. Why does the 1st input and the 2nd output contain different addresses if the “change” has to be sent back to the receiver. This is because, nowadays, wallets add an extra layer of security by using 1 private-public key pair address for a single transaction. This means every time u send some Bitcoin, ur wallet creates a new address for the balance to be received in. This address is then used for the next transaction and the process is repeated again. This is all done automatically by the app that manages ur wallet whether it is Exodus, Coinbase Wallet or any other Bitcoin supported wallet. 

And yes, based on the math, there are enough wallet addresses to last till the extinction of humanity.

A 30ish guy very casually asked me how much for the hard drive and I told him I’d have to call my son at college and ask what something like that is worth, and the guy said ‘tell ya what I have to leave right now and I’ll give you $300 right now for it because it fits my computer perfectly yadda yadda….

2) No one ever went broke taking a profit.  A 8x is great.  Be thankful you didn’t FOMO back in

3) You can DCA sell.  Sell 25% at 10x profit, sell another 25% at 20x profit, and another 25% at 30x (or whatever).  This way, you get exposure to all types of local tops and still retain some of your position",hhtst1k,2021-10-24 13:52:30,160

yogafan00000,"BTC.X is the ticker symbol to track the USD/BTC pair.  Typically you would use a crypto exchange to buy and sell, like Kraken or Coinbase although more brokerages are starting to offer crypto holding services.  If you want to HODL your keys, you need to have a Bitcoin wallet on your phone or desktop in order to transfer the coins.  It's technical.  You pay fees when you buy and sell and also when you transfer to wallets.  Typically not available for registered accounts like TFSA or RRSP.

BTCX is the ticker for Galaxy Bitcoin ETF available only to Canadians in your brokerage account.  They hold a certain amount of Bitcoins and your shares represent a certain interest in these Bitcoins.  The fees are structured similar to other ETF.  You will not be allowed to take ownership of any coins.   There are two versions of this product, one is hedged to the USD and the other is not.  The biggest advantage is that these are available inside your TFSA/RRSP.  There are other variations of Bitcoin ETF's in Canada:  BTCC, EBIT, BTCQ and probably more.  They each have their own configuration and you will have to research each one to decide if it's right for your investment objectives.

With Bitcoin, you are the custodian (unless you leave your balance on the Crypto Exchange, which has it's own set of issues).  If you lose your computer or phone with no backup, you have no recourse.  No one can help you.  Your coins and wealth are gone.  It's 100% your responsibility to ensure your assets are secure and safe.

With BTCX (or any other holding ETF) you are paying for custody services via their MER fees.  You could possibly sue or have other recourse if they get hacked or do an exitscam, but, of course, it would still be a bad time.

Be aware some ETF's don't actually hold Bitcoin such as the new American ETF: BITO.  They only hold futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

antimatter_beam_core,"&gt;  However, isn't it possible that the use of a blockchain somehow can create some value.  (eg. as a way to 'save' transfers or some other information)?

1. That isn't how owning bitcoin works.  The network of miners creates that value (whatever it may be), and you own no part in that network when you buy bitcoin.  You're their _customer_, not _owner_.
2. Bitcoin is properly understood as a _fiat_ currency, not a [representative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_money) one.  There is virtually no intrinsic or use value, and instead, the price comes virtually entirely from a) speculation and b) adoption.  Bitcoin can never have nearly enough adoption to justify its price, and as you know speculation is negative sum and you can't reliably make money from it.

&gt; Or in ethereum's case, the smart contracts can probably create some sort of value

1. Call them what they are: computer programs being run by a ludicrously expensive cloud provider.  Once you understand that, the obvious question is ""why would anyone pay five orders of magnitude more for exactly the same thing except the speculation""?
2. Owning ethereum does not actually contribute to running those programs, any more than having a pile of USD under your bed is investing in Amazon, Google, Microsoft, etc.  Someone _else_ is doing that productive work, and making the profits from it.",hhvxrbe,2021-10-25 02:51:07,93

But an institution or a nation state trying to secure their custody, especially from insider threats, is not a trivial risk to manage.

biscuitboi967,"This is so sketch and probably not for the reason OP and his friend think. First, her a goddam lawyer with some of that Bitcoin money and she or he will tell you that assets held before the marriage are separate property in nearly all states, as are the gains and appreciation on them.  The fucking bitcoins aren’t subject to community property division. She can try. She can ask. She won’t get them. Now, using some of them to buy a house gets tricky, but he can trace that shit AND show that a) that portion of the downpayment or mortgage was paid with premarital assets and b) that the appreciation in the house value can be tied to that as well. In short HE IS DOING THIS FOR NOTHING. But what he is starting is a whole bunch of shit that will make him look SHADY AF in the court’s eyes. They WILL punish friend for that because he comes with “unclean hands” and, frankly, they’ll want to know what other shady shit he did. All because she wanted to get a new job elsewhere that would have brought in MORE money for the community to split. In fact, they were married for such a short time, that there probably won’t be much to separate and not a whole lot of appreciation and her new, better paying job will negate any alimony to which she might have been entitled BUT that goes out the window when you act like a dipshit in an EASILY IDENTIFIABLE WAY like friend is.

Difficult-Stick3596,"I’m an ex-nuclear physicist who used to work in the field of nuclear data that was used for modeling nuclear reactors, so not directly but was close to the world of nuclear power. 

I find the idea of mining bitcoin with nuclear power bigger than the recent hype over renewables.

Nuclear was always limited to the base load (which is quite low compared to peak load), due to very long lag to scaling up and down power output for nuclear. So basically nuclear was limited to base load and other power sources which could ramp up and down faster filled the gap between base load and peak demand. Nuclear is by far the most energy efficient fuel by density and among the cleanest of fuels when consider all environmental impacts, but was always limited to this base load. France could get around this and get to &gt;80% nuclear by selling power to neighbors, but this was really  geo hack and said more about their neighbors energy sources rather than some way everyone could be majority nuclear.

Back then some 15 years ago there was some push (well I attended a few talks at LLNL where I worked) for using hydrogen fuel cells (which was competing at the time with EVs for car power), as a way to store the excess energy produced by nuclear so it could take a bigger fraction of power consumption above base load. The excess could be used to produce hydrogen fuel cells which essentially store the energy to be used later in vehicles. This idea fell through when EVs won out over hydrogen as the next-gen car fuel.

Bitcoin mining is bringing this idea back and could lead to a resurgence in new nuclear power (which is the only real solution to clean up our energy grid) and make it more stable. I hope this leads to increased nuclear power usage and incentives to build modern style nuclear reactors which are orders of magnitude safer than the old reactors which give nuclear a bad image and should have been retired decades ago.",hi3256v,2021-10-26 15:28:12,557

therealnumpty,"So basically some people or organisations choose to buy and sell bitcoin (or other crypto's) on the spot market and others choose to trade on the derivatives market.

The spot market is just buying a set amount of the currency at the current market price. So if you buy say $1k worth of bitcoin when the price is 60k, you get 1 60th of a coin.

The derivatives market is different, whereby you don't buy the actual currency, you buy a contract that requires you to buy a specific amount of the currency at a specific price.

Let's say the current price is 60k. You can take out a contract that says you will buy 1bitcoin for 70k at the end of this month. Likewise the person on the other end will sell you that 1 bitcoin at that price. This is essentially a bet that the price will rise above 70k, because if it doesn't, you would basically be buying the bitcoin for more than it's actually worth (and who wants to do that?). In this case you are ""long"" bitcoin. 

So when you take out the contract, you might pay 20k for it up front but the rest is on margin ( basically a loan). Your contract will have a value based on the current price and the price on the contract. So if for example the price of bitcoin goes to 80k, your contract is worth 10k (the difference between the asset value and the buy price on the contract). 

But if the price of bitcoin falls, the value of the contract also falls. If it falls below a certain level, you will either have to put more money up to keep the contract running (This is called a margin call). If you don't, you get liquidated, which is where the value of your contract goes to 0, and the person on the other side takes the money you've put in and the contract is void.

This is basically what's happened here. Lots of people were making bets that the price would rise (these people were ""long"") then the price fell, so all of their contracts became worthless and they've lost their money",hi8awo3,2021-10-27 19:23:26,206

Miliean,"So most businesses operate by buying a thing then selling that thing for more money.  But the act of operating a business is that you need to bring some value to that transaction, even if that value is that you bought in bulk and sold individually.  

But if you are buying and selling things for profit (or loss) but are not actually doing anything to the things then it's not a business you are operating, it's an investment.

Houses, stocks, bonds, Pokémon cards, beanie babies, bitcoin.  These are all things that a person might buy, hold for a time, then sell for a profit or loss.  These are capital transactions. 

So lets say I buy some hot sneakers for $100.  They're pretty cool but I know that they are actually pretty rare and I think the value will go up so I just put them in the closest and wait. A year later those sneakers are worth $1,000.

If I sell the sneakers, I have a ""realized"" capital gain of $900.  And I get taxed on that gain.  However, if I don't sell them there's no realized gain and no tax effects.

The act of selling the thing is known as a ""taxable event"" and it triggers a capital gain or loss and there's a tax treatment there. 

So people have investments, those investments increase in value, but unless the investments get sold there's no taxable event and the government collects no taxes. 

Lets say I bought 100 sneakers for $100 a pair.  They raise in value to $$5,000 a pair.  I have spent $10,000 for something that is now worth $500,000.  But again, nothing has been sold and therefore no taxes have been collected.  

Again this is all how the ""normal"" capital gains  system is intended to work and that's how it works in almost every country in the world, not just the US. 

People who are REALLY wealthy, get around paying taxes in many ways but one of them is that they rarely ever actually sell their investments.  How do they afford to live? Well they take these large investments and use them as colorectal on loans.

So my $500,000 sneaker collection, I approach a bank and offer it as colorectal on a $50,000 loan at 5% interest for 1 year.  I use that $50,000 to live on for the year.  After the year my sneaker collection is now worth $700,000, I repeat this process by borrowing more money against my sneakers. I borrow enough to repay my initial loan + interest ($52,500) and I borrow enough to pay my living expenses for year 2 (another $50,000).

So I've now lived for 2 years off my sneaker collection, but I haven't actually sold a single sneaker.  There have been no taxable events and no taxes have been paid or are even owed.  This is all 100% legal and is how most wealthy people live day to day.  

Eventually you might think I will need to sell the sneakers and pay the bank.  But, no, I do not.  As long as the sneakers keep raising in value faster than I'm borrowing against them the bank is perfectly happy to repeat this process forever. So 10 years from now my sneakers might be worth $3,000,000 and I'll owe the bank like $1,500,000.  So the bank is perfectly happy to repeat this process basically forever, as long as my sneakers keep going up in value.

An ""unrealized"" capital gains tax is a tax that happens when the value of my investments increase even if I have not actually sold them.  So back to the sneakers.

I buy them for $10,000 and after year 1 they are worth $500,000.  Regardless of what borrowing shenanigans I get up to to avoid tax, the government sees the raise in value as income and so I get taxed on it.  So even if I have not sold a single sneaker the government says, you've had a $490,000 unrealized gain, we tax that at 15% so you owe $73,500 in taxes. The government does not accept sneakers as payment, only dollars, so you need to borrow that money from the bank or you need to sell some sneakers. 

So to recap.  A capital gain is when you own a thing that goes up in value (and a loss is when it goes down).  A realized gain is when you actually turn that into dollars by selling the thing.  An unrealized gain is when you have not yet sold the thing.  Normal capital gains tax only applies once you sell it and realize the gain.  The new proposed tax will be on very, very, wealthy people who have not actually turned those large investments into cash.",hi8i9ga,2021-10-27 20:48:30,3741

bitusher,"1) Just spend your bitcoin with lightning as lightning is extremely private by default and if you need to make an onchain tx than use lightning to mix your UTXOs

2) Use coinjoin wallets that can't steal your btc

a) Wasabi wallet https://wasabiwallet.io/ (best , but requires at least 0.1 BTC to coinjoin) , this will shortly change with wasabi 2.0

https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/privacy-guarantees-of-wasabi-wallet-2-0/

b) Samourai wallet whirlpool

c) joinmarket (good but more complicated to use)

https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver


--------------

As long as you don't immediately need to spend the solution is very simple

1) Buy bitcoin (even from a regulated exchange with fees of 0.35% to 0.5%)

2) Withdraw it to temporary wallet A (Example- mobile open source hot wallet)

3) Within 1-4 hours of receiving it in wallet A send to wallet B(example - your hardware wallet) and never send transactions backwards from wallet B to wallet A. Send entire amount every time you do this to insure that the exchange cannot associate your Unique withdrawal addresses with each transaction.

Note- you can technically use a single wallet and use ""coin control "" feature to manually separate out your UTXOs but the above is an idiot proof method to avoid mistakes

Why?

You can easily spend Bitcoin privately in many ways , including just using a lightning wallet today . Since you are just concerned about long term privacy you are better off simply creating evidence immediately for plausible deniability that the address you withdrew to (assumed by exchanges and regulators to likely be yours) no longer has the bitcoin and those bitcoin could have been spent , lost, sold , used within a small window of time where no or an insignificant amount of capital gains would have occurred.",hidogvr,2021-10-28 22:42:05,91

bitusher,"The answer depends upon multiple variables. Here is some general advice.

1)	Do you have high interest debt (5% and higher) and no savings?

If the answer is Yes - Do not invest in any Bitcoin.

2)	Do you have any credit card debt and fiat savings?

If the answer is Yes ,than at minimum pay off all your credit card debt with fiat savings unless you are in debt to such a degree and plan on filing bankruptcy. Do not invest in Bitcoin until you have paid off all high interest debt

3)	Have a lot of low interest credit card debt (below 5%) and no fiat savings?

You should make a budget , cut expenses, and simultaneously start paying off your debt(unless you plan to file chapter 7 bankruptcy) , start saving a fiat emergency fund, and start buying Bitcoin.

4)	Have no debt and no fiat savings?

You should make a budget , cut expenses, start simultaneously saving for 6-12 months worth of living expenses in fiat emergency fund (only stable forms of fiat, obviously not the Argentinian peso or Venezuelan bolivar) and invest in Bitcoin, and seriously consider investing in stocks(preferable an index fund ETF like SPDR) or a IRA.

5) You have a large amount of fiat savings and no debt and want to know if its best to dollar cost average invest or invest it all immediately?

The answer almost always is to make a plan and invest 100% of the fiat (not including your emergency fund) immediately in a diversified portfolio of investments that are non correlated (land, stocks, Bitcoin, businesses with positive cash flow) . It is often impossible to time the market and those that invest earlier will gain the most compound interest. The reason why dollar cost average investment is popular and a fine strategy is merely because most people don't have a large amount of fiat to invest upfront so invest a little each time they are paid.

Here is a useful tool for you - https://dcabtc.com

Thus if you get paid twice a month than what you should do is buy some Bitcoin immediately twice a month and also in addition set buy limit orders on an exchange for 5-10% below spot price. If those orders do not get filled by  the following paycheck than buy your set amount and reset the buy limit orders for 5-10% below spot price from the current market price.
The reason for this is 2 fold:

1)	you can auto pickup savings with BTC volatility on the dips which is psychologically rewarding

2)	If a large amount of people create large amounts of Buy limit support than BTC becomes more stable unit of account and more liquid leading to more investor confidence and making BTC more of a currency(less volatility = better unit of account) and thus increases the likelihood your investment will continue appreciating in value.


The reason having a fiat savings account is so important is it not only will it save you if you lose a job or have an unexpected car expense or medical bill, but that it makes you a more rational investor that is less stressed out by the volatility in your more risky investments like Bitcoin. Bitcoin historically has had at least 2 bear markets lasting a little over 1 year thus you need to be prepared to not be forced to sell at a loss for at least 2 years to give yourself enough of a buffer.",hieae3n,2021-10-29 01:13:14,97

Intention-Jazzlike,"Yes, bitcoin might actually cancel loans. Like you said, by borrowing bitcoin now you will owe a lot more later.

With fiat your money becomes worth less over time and it's impossible to save up faster than the price increases in housing we have seen over the last decade. So people have to take on increasingly bigger loans to get the capital to be able to purchase a house. Lenders are willing to lend out fiat for the loan so they get to counteract inflation. Thanks to inflation your loan becomes easier to pay off every year, so it all works out.

Bitcoin actually flips the system around. When you start working as a young adult your bitcoin is not worth ""much"", but keep saving up over the years and your bitcoin start to become worth more. With a deflationary system, saving actually gets rewarded instead of spending. Eventually you net worth will be enough to purchase a house, rewarding the work you put in early on in your younger years.

So we go from a system of instant gratification, having to take a huge loan to pay for housing right now and then having to pay it off for the rest of your life (like an extended credit card debt from hell), to delayed gratification, having to save now to be able to purchase a house later on (without going into debt).",hihiip9,2021-10-29 16:29:35,109

Chart for Today: https://imgur.com/gallery/FFlga7I

Over the past two days the price bounced off the previous un-closed High Pole Warning Reversal Target and started a new column back upwards.  We are one box from matching the high on the last coiumn of Xs and two boxes from a break out.  That movement breaks the most local resistance, and approaches the last point of resistance heading upwards.

Here are the numbers:

1.  The formation is 7 columns wide.  While not wide enough to stir anyone’s loins, it is a solid formation if the price starts to stair step.  Of course if it decides to shit the bed, it means a likely 7% drop.

2. A break out would occur at $63,996.  A break down would require a price below the $57,935 box.

3. Local support is down at $58,514.  This support is rising from the lows on 10/12.  Local resistance is $64,636 (lower than the break out).  This is coming down from the highs of the 20th.

4. We are currently 38 boxes above the positive trend line at $44,286.  A mythical trade from the trend reversal would yield 44.51%.  I say mythical because the trend reversal is often not confirmed for days or weeks after it really happens.  Its merely an academic exercise.

I know today is futures expiration and it really bothers me that with the ETFs we have to worry about this crap again.  Remember in December of 2017 is when the first batch of futures came out and we were battered for that long winter?  Yeah...that sucked.

Turns out that dude has an important NFT PATENT that could come into play if you want box art copies tied to NFT tied to blockchain. 

&gt; BCN: How did you get involved with the Flipkick market concept?

&gt; Ja Rule: Man, Flipkick.io is such a great idea. So as I got into NFTs I noticed a dope project and the whole angle was something different, which I really loved. [The angle of taking physical works of art and authenticating them in a similar way NFTs are authenticated on the blockchain but with a chip. We have a patent pending on our technology, and when I say ours it’s because I’m part of the company.](https://stockmarkettoday.org/hip-hop-star-ja-rule-discusses-the-growing-nft-space-and-crypto-i-like-the-fact-that-bitcoin-is-decentralized/)

Tying the physical to the NFT world with a chip.

Lilca87,"There’s different levels of each bull run. Each get longer and more stable. The inception bull run was extremely volatile because market cap was growing exponentially. The 2nd run (this run) - I think it has the potential to go 5-10x the ATH which would put us at 0.00007-0.00014.
But the only way we get that is with an exchange or listing 

Once that run finishes I can see a length consolidation like bitcoin has. And once you get to a certain market cap you’re basically slow growthing and crushing reflections. 

Tokenomics is the key here. Release of projects and exchange is critical to this current run. 

In my honest opinion, if the safemoon team can’t release the major stuff in the next 3-6 months, it could cripple the token. They have to capitalize on the following and hype",hild9te,2021-10-30 11:04:37,116

buyongmafanle,"Here's some brutal honesty from someone reading your posting history. Your problem is not saving for FIRE. Your problem is you. You seem to have a large amount of issues in your life that you haven't worked through yet. 

Your exact words and the essence of my reply to you comes from this post of yours:

&gt;I avoided addressing my insecurities and instead stuck with something I knew ""best."" I didn't know how to increase my skills due to several mental handicaps, so I took what I could do and cut my expenses down.

&gt;My biggest goal in life was to date. I lost a lot of weight in high school, but my social anxiety got the best of me. I lived with my parents for too long and so I just focused on saving money.

&gt;And then the routines kept going forward and now here I am. It was like I just woke up.

&gt;20 years of my life wasted. 8 year old me should have been focusing on having fun and getting better at socializing instead of trying to save money.

&gt;Another thing: past the age of 10, I have never been hugged. It isn't like I fear it, it just never happened. And there is a loneliness to it. Like a deep craving for physical contact. But still, for whatever reason, I avoid it. Only acceptable touch was a ""business handshake.""

&gt;My entire life can be summed up with one word: avoidance.

That's rough to read. Life can be rough. I can say that I was absolutely born lucky and that I haven't had to deal with some of the issues you have. To that, you can take my advice with a grain of salt.

From here on out, though, I will commence with the advice.

Your life looks like shit because your past has led you to this point. The things you've done and have chosen to do in the past are what got you here. You're no longer 18 and are in full control of your destiny. If you want things to change, you have to change them. 

You say that you're too old now to change your life. Too old to change the direction of your life. That you're staring down the end of life because of all the things you missed out on or didn't do when you were young. To that I say, you have no clue what you're talking about. 

You're 28. To you that sounds old because it's the oldest you've ever been. I'm 40, does that make me a fossil? 

My brother is 44 this year. He was divorced at 42, had his bank cleaned out by his ex-wife, she took everything that wasn't nailed down. He started out with LESS than you have at 42. Do you think he'd love 14 extra years to clean up the mess? You bet. But now, he's dating again, actually engaged to a nice lady and he's happy. DAMNED happy. Happier than I've seen him since our childhood. He had to hit reset at 42.

You're 28. What was I doing at 28? I was working for someone else making less than average money. My girlfriend and I at the time decided to move back home with her folks and to start our own business. So we did.

12 years later, here I am. Through a GOD DAMNED MOUNTAIN of work, I've become successful. But it was rough as fuck. Not gonna bullshit you about that. We had years in the beginning where our combined income was less than the annual average income of a single person. But we made it. Things turned around for us financially at about 33, 34. 

What does this show you? That there is no single day or job that's going to make it all better. Nobody is going to come along and sweep away your problems or worries, or offer you the greatest cushiest job on the planet just because you're the hero of your own story. 

Life is ROUGH my man. Everyone you see that's successful has faced struggles. All the other FIRE people here have had their lows, their battles, their lean years, their low points. But they've faced them, made a plan, and stuck to it. 

To me, that seems to be your major problem. You haven't made a plan. You seem to think the plan happens to you or it comes out of the sky. It doesn't. Maybe you got dealt a shit hand in life. That sucks, for real it does. You have my sympathy that your life could have gone better from 0-18. But after that point, the onus is on you. If 18-28 sucked, you had a large part in the decisions of that era. Maybe not everything that went bad was your fault, but a lot of it could have been changed with a plan, with a pathway, with goals. 

Don't set arbitrary goals. Don't say ""I'm going to hit FIRE."" You need to say ""I'm going to hit FIRE at XXXX year because from now til then I'm going to YYYY and ZZZZ every year."" 

Decide what you want your life to look like, then slowly steer the boat that direction. You aren't going to instantly undo the momentum of your past 10 years in a year. It might take 5, 10, 15 years to change your life's momentum, but I promise you it can be done. 

To a lot of people they see the success of others and forget about the hours of invisible work and sacrifice that were required to get there. It just looks like it happened from the outside. From the inside it's not so simple. It looks that way for everything that's good in life. If it's easy, it's usually not worth spending your time on. And I don't think you've come to terms with that yet. 

Because you're young. You're just 28, my friend. You've got a LOOOOOT of time to turn that boat around. Make your plan and get to it, because you aren't going to catch the next 2012 bitcoin. You won't catch Apple stock at 48 cents. You won't get Netflix or Amazon on launch day price. It's NOT going to be easy, but it can be done. So do it.",hilgk0p,2021-10-30 11:32:11,287

xmlify,"Please, please, please take your time!

There are many older websites that explain how to spend your keys from private wallets (like yours with 2 QR codes).  But please be careful, because the instructions that were acceptable many years ago, may provide you with a quick way to lose your bitcoin as more sophisticated attackers will find a way to steal your bitcoin.

There are 2 QR codes, so...

DO NOT SHARE THE LARGER QR code, nor the longer string of upper/lower case letters and numbers with anyone.   Do not take a photo with your phone either.

It is OK to share the SMALLER public key (aka address) which again is the smaller QR code especially if you want to use it to check your balance.  Visit this site, for example, https://www.blockchain.com/explorer

Ideally, you should set up an air gapped machine that runs electrum.   For example, here is a site which explains in all detail how to setup a couple of Raspberry PI machines.

I personally use Proton, though. They have a really good track record, they're one of the few VPN companies that is *actually* based where they say (Switzerland), their free tier is the only one you'll find that isn't dodgy, and they're backed by a couple of tech and innovation incubators. That said, [their email service did have to provide the IP address of a French climate activist to the authorities](https://protonmail.com/blog/climate-activist-arrest/) not too long ago, but they were fairly transparent about it, and it doesn't look like they tried to hide anything.

lucasbelaq,"&gt; Technically all stocks are bubbles waiting to pop. 

lol. Most stocks have realistic evaluations. Tesla is being traded like bitcoin. The p/e is 360, and looking at say, ford, it's 20, or Toyota, 8. It's being traded as a huge growth stock with tons of future profit already baked in. One bad quarter and it could pop. Especially as every manufacturer is making electric cars. 

You can argue that Tesla is a good investment, but let's not pretend it's not extremely over valuated compared to competition. Most stocks aren't bubbles and have a pretty fair evaluation.

Step one: put stuff on a blockchain that people already buy.

Step two: MOASS.

Straight up - a decade ago Xbox announced cloud based games on the XBone at E3 (what they considered a sort of holy grail for consoles) and they were bombarded by one question:

“If my games are on the cloud, do I actually own them?” People were worried that if they lost access to their gamer tag, possibly by being banned or moving out of their current country (marketplace) or shipping out to Afghanistan and losing internet access etc. That they’d lose access to their library and Microsoft straight up did not anticipate the question and had no good answers. Players would own access to a  file owned by Xbox but not the file itself, no lending to friends, no resale, no ability to play if the server was ever shut down... people hated it.

Reggie from Nintendo filmed an impromptu piece backstage showing how to share disk based games with your friends.

Playstation added a slide to their presentation that simply said “announcing disk based games!” It got the loudest cheer of the whole convention, including the triumphant Destiney 1 reveal.

The community saw Xbox attempt to drastically shift the power balance away from the consumer and it rebuked it. The PS4 buried the XBone that holiday season and Microsoft had to reverse course.

Most of us had never even heard of Bitcoin back then let alone the concept of a Non-Fungible Token but honestly this was always the logical conclusion. Proper ownership, regardless of platform, what you buy you own.
