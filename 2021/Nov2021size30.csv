It has no added emissions but it requires to build facilities that do have an impact (concrete, turbines, etc). The advantage is that it has a much lower impact than coal generators but has to be produced at certain places. If you want to scale the operation you need to build a proper energy grid with the losses it incurs. This is costly, perhaps prohibitively.

Mining bitcoin allows to be profitable early (or at all) and scale up the operation. This may very well bring cleaner energy to more people as it can act as a subsidy to build the facility and grid.",2021-10-01 17:27:18

However, it is important to note that while many NFTs are tied to digital artwork, what you are buying is *not* the artwork.

hf231xw,Equivalent_Office_67,50,"CKB is generated from 3 sources, 33.6 billion CKB was minted from the genesis block (of which 8.4 B were burnt at day 0 which was in November 2019) leaving a total of 25.2B to be in circulation. Of this, 19.8 B have already been vested and the remaining 2 vesting periods are in May and December 2022. No more of this type of issuance will be burnt based on the current plan.

The second source of CKB is from the mining, where a total of 33.6 B will eventually be mined, with halvings similar to Bitcoin (currently 4.2 billion coins are be mined each year, this will halve every 4 years (i.e. 2023; 2027; 2031....)).  This type of issuance doesn't consider burning.

The final source is from a secondary issuance of 1.34 B/year which is divided between miner incentives, and a DOA where CKB can be staked and you receive rewards equivalent to the inflation of this issuance, the remainder being burnt. Currently 80% of this secondary issuance has been burnt over the 2 year life of the mainnet. This number will reduce as the halving progress and the miner rewards from the POW mining reduce, also it will reduce by the amount of CKB stored in the DOA and locked up by Dapps (they have to buy CKB at a rate of 1 CKB = 1 byte to allow them the space to store smart contracts etc). Eventually some of the currently burned coins could be used for governance if the community are in agreement.

So to answer your, yes CKB will carry on to be burnt daily for a number of years to come, but there will be more coins created than burned so inflation will always be positive. However, the use cases of CKB locking up CKB will make this scarce if it is successful. 

In the Nervos Explorer there is a chart that shows the amount burnt historically which current sits at 10.1 billion CKBs:

Bitcoin is not a Ponzi Scheme.
In a Ponzi scheme:

there is an ""operator"" -- a central authority (one person, or a small group), a swindler.

The swindler receives money from people

The swindler promises investors that their money will be invested in some business venture with an expected high rate of return. That money is NOT invested. There is no money-making business venture. Any returns are paid from the swindled money.

The entire Ponzi Scheme is based upon a big, fat lie.

The Ponzi scheme can only keep going so long as new suckers arrive to put their money into it.

A Ponzi scheme cannot survive a ""crash"".

A Ponzi scheme is illegal and immoral.

Bitcoin is legal, and honest.

Bitcoin has no central authority.

Bitcoin is purchased from other Bitcoin owners and/or multiple exchanges.

Bitcoin makes no promises about ROI.

Bitcoin is not, and does not pretend to be a ""money making venture""; Bitcoin IS money.

Bitcoin has survived several crashes.

Bitcoin can keep going without any new investors.

hf52ghk,KitsuneMori,200,"Bitcoin is an asset that is sold on the free market, which appreciates in value as the demand for it rises. In other words: a speculative investment.

A Ponzi scheme is when someone claims they will make a speculative investment **on your behalf** in an asset like Bitcoin, but **they actually don't**. Instead, they pocket the money and pretend to pay out a regular return by attracting new clients and using their ""investment"" money to pay off the old clients.

If you understood this, you would realize a ""Bitcoin Ponzi scheme"" does not involve any actual Bitcoin. Only the false claim that someone will invest in Bitcoin on your behalf when they mean to fleece you.

You can protect yourself by buying and holding Bitcoin directly.

Note as well that a Ponzi scheme is decidedly **not** early investors making a profit by selling to late investors. (Sometimes called ""greater fools."") There is nothing wrong with selling an asset for more than you bought it for **when the value of the asset has increased over time**. And neither is the buyer automatically a fool for paying the **fair market value** of a thing at the time he bought it.

[https://coldcardwallet.com/](https://coldcardwallet.com/) \- ColdCaard is currently the safest and most recommended here.

There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend as not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, etc. Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different than the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. 



&gt;Same with ledger.

No worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

hf46zoy,Exitshuffler,50,"Good bull periods remind me to be thankful of my younger self for taking an interest in crypto early. My first time of hearing about crypto was the DOGE NASCAR way back when and I mined dogecoin for fun for a little bit in HS but eventually just lost interest. Fun fact, I found my old address but lost the seed but there’s still like 8K doge just sitting on it that I can’t sell lol.

It wasn’t until I met my college roommate (who I 100% owe a beer or really an entire bar of beers) in my freshman year who was the typical libertarian guy who convinced me to take Bitcoin more seriously. From there I started to read into ETH and found that the mission, technology and product was something I saw the potential in. I started to shore up my crypto holdings during the 17 bubble and especially post crash all through 18-19 a good size of my income was dropping into crypto. This was the hardest as everyone I know in life just completely gave up crypto and I was that loony still investing. 

Now I am in my mid twenties and crypto has given me the financial firepower to purchase a nice condo just outside of a HCOL city (which I’m so excited for! It’s a brand new build). 

And for that and keeping me sane throughout the entire time I really have to also thank crypto communities like ethfinance to be able continue the conversation with likeminded crypto enthusiasts. Thank y’all :) and have a great day everyone.",2021-10-03 01:50:20

hfa3rhn,TheMeatery,106,"Several comments already pointed at how starting a post titled ""Bitcoin is Worthless. Change My Mind."" could be problematic. It might have sounded different in your head when you posted it, maybe even funny but let's break down your title when used the way it was over a medium where we can't see your facial expression or hear the tone of your voice:

1. ""Bitcoin is Worthless"" - that's a statement. You started by setting the tone of the conversation. Why might a statement like that cause problems? Well, you came into a sub of 3.4m people and offended some by indirectly stating their research, time, commitment and investments are worthless and that you know better. People here have spent considerable more time on this to ensure they protect their wealth and futures. It's condescending to make a statement like that.
2. ""Change My Mind"" - that's a demand. Now that you have evoked some kind of emotional response with your first sentence, you proceed to demand that we convince you otherwise. In principal many won't bother now, some will get angry and others will still try and convince you. You'll get a mixed bag of responses and likely draw more argumentative personally types into your thread.

You have to consider taking at least some responsibility of how your first thread turned out. The second thread called ""Groupthink is a Disease"" which is also now aimed at the subbredit collective isn't much better.

China is highly anti-immigrant, is a surveillance state that cracks down on dissidents, steals intellectual property constantly, and has simply peaked. No one wants to immigrate there, and they don't want you, but they actually need a massive influx in population. Their demographics of the previous few decades made them a powerhouse. Now, they are literally running out of steam. Quite literally, since something near 50% of their IC has or will receive blackouts this year. 

The fact the state is cracking down on videogames and bitcoin while also drumming up support for their wag the dog campaign to finally bring the Han Chinese Taiwan under the heel of the PRC is quite evident to me that China is well aware of its precarious position. It is poised to lose half its population, and soon. In two generations the place is going to be a ghost town, comparatively. Who will be the cheap labor they need to sustain their growth?

First off what they are talking about isn't proper UBI, but a new type of gig work further ""gamifyimg"" the kind of digital odd jobs that Amazon Mechanical Turks is based around. 

Do you play any Gacha games? Like Genshin Impact or AFK Arena? They are based around a virtual economy model where you can pay to win by converting RL money to gems or whatever they call it.

The apes' big idea is for a new game (let's call it Anime Anti-feminist Objectification). In AAO you can convert those gems in to Dogecoin or something equally useless. Some versions of the idea for AAO have the infrastructure of the game being used to deploy a new block chain based currency usable for in game and RL purchases (a GemCoin if your will) and others have it using the game servers to create a massive mining operation where like 1,000,000 gems would let players buy a BitCoin. 

The Ape Company would still make money from AAO by using the standard industry tactics to promote unhealthy playstyles. Gambling, Subliminal Messages, ect. Then once the players run out of gems they can still get more by doing work like filling out surveys, participating in focus groups, reading native language text aloud, and categorizing datasets for AI development. 

But in theory some kind of UberChimp could exist who can just take their gems and run.

hfmykz4,backup2thebackup2,92,"very startup has an origin story, a tale that illustrates its core principles. For Wealthsimple, that meant promoting low-fee, passive investing.

After selling his first business about a decade ago, Wealthsimple co-founder Michael Katchen constructed a simple portfolio of exchange-traded funds using Microsoft Excel, then told the friends with whom he cashed out that this approach was the best way to invest their money.

The underlying premise: It’s tough to outperform the market over the long run, so for most people it’s better to invest in a mix of low-cost ETFs and ride the wave.

“The feedback I got from my friends was, ‘Mike, we’re lazy. We love the system, but can you just please do it for us?’ ” Mr. Katchen told The Globe and Mail in 2016. “And they became the first 10 clients of Wealthsimple.”

The concept proved popular with the millennial crowd, attracting billions of dollars in assets to Wealthsimple’s so-called robo-adviser, and the company went so far as to buy Super Bowl ads preaching “simple automated investing.” In no time, Wealthsimple had so much buzz that people started to wonder if it would take down Bay Street’s old guard.

Lately, so much of that seems like a past life. The company’s automated platform still exists, but Wealthsimple is now advertising a day trading app for retail investors. And it’s not just stocks – it is heavily promoting its new cryptocurrency business, which allows users to swap a slew of crypto assets.

The new strategy seems at odds with Wealthsimple’s founding principles, particularly so with crypto, which is highly volatile and has some of the highest trading fees around. In a recent speech, Gary Gensler, the new head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, called the crypto market the Wild West, “rife with fraud, scams and abuse.” China recently made all crypto transactions illegal.

Despite the hard pivot, Wealthsimple has said little about its change of heart. When asked about the new strategy, no one was willing to be interviewed. Instead, the company sent e-mails explaining that it is diversifying to target different client segments.

“Our mission is to help everyone achieve financial freedom, no matter who they are or how much they have. That mission hasn’t changed. We are a fast growing company building a full financial ecosystem for our clients across their savings, investing, spending, tax and crypto needs,” Mr. Katchen wrote.

As for crypto’s volatility, which prompted the SEC chair to call it a “highly speculative asset class,” Mr. Katchen does not believe that disqualifies it from inclusion in a well-rounded portfolio. Wealthsimple, he wrote, is “very comfortable recommending that our clients put their money in diversified, low-cost portfolios, while also supporting them if they wish to invest in particular companies or promising new technology.” He also said that Wealthsimple is the first crypto platform to be regulated by a securities authority in Canada.

What is happening at Wealthsimple is playing out in a similar fashion across the robo-adviser industry. Once-popular rivals in the United States, including Wealthfront and Betterment, are facing existential crises of their own. For all the billions of dollars that robo-advisers manage, it often isn’t enough to turn a profit. Betterment’s CEO stepped down last December, and its new leader acknowledged that an initial public offering likely was not possible until the company started making money.

“These businesses operate on very tight margins. They just have extremely low fees, therefore they have to achieve pretty large scale before they’re profitable,” said David Goldstone, head of research and analytics at Backend Benchmarking, which tracks the robo-adviser market, in an interview.

Even if a robo-adviser brings in tens of millions of dollars a year in revenue by charging around 0.5 per cent annually, the company has to spend heavily to attract new clients. “There was an industry-wide underestimation of how much it was going to cost to acquire customers,” Mr. Goldstone added.

Compounding the problem, the old guard woke up and launched robo-advisers of their own. In the U.S., Vanguard and Charles Schwab now dominate the market, with assets worth US$210-billion and US$60-billion, respectively, at the end of 2020. Betterment, the largest independent robo-adviser in the U.S., managed US$28-billion at the same date. In Canada, Bank of Montreal launched its SmartFolio robo-adviser in 2016, and Royal Bank of Canada followed suit in 2018.

The incumbents aren’t simply more competition – they have a structural advantage, because they can cross-sell their robo-platforms to existing clients, lowering their customer-acquisition costs.

To adjust, Wealthsimple started diversifying in 2018 with a high-interest savings account, then added Wealthsimple Trade, which allows users to buy and sell stocks. In the fall of 2019, the company acquired software maker Simpletax. And a few months later it launched Wealthsimple Cash, a hybrid of a no-fee chequing account and a high-interest savings account.

The pivot to crypto started in August, 2020, when Wealthsimple’s users were permitted to start trading Bitcoin and Ether. This past June, trading expanded to 14 additional crypto assets, including Litecoin and Dogecoin.

Wealthsimple does not break down its assets by division, but retail trading and crypto are what makes Silicon Valley salivate. Last fall, Wealthsimple raised $114-million in a funding round that valued the company at $1.4-billion. In May, it raised another $750-million, boosting its valuation to $5-billion only seven months later.

Retail trading app Robinhood and crypto trading hub Coinbase recently went public in the United States, and their financial statements illustrate just how explosive retail trading revenue growth can be, particularly in crypto. At Robinhood, crypto brought in US$320-million in the first half of 2021, compared with just US$10-million in the first half of 2020.

To understand what that could mean for Wealthsimple, simply look at the fee schedule. The company’s robo-clients often pay 0.5 per cent annually, while crypto traders pay 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent per transaction (although Wealthsimple must split that fee with other parties).

Stock trading and crypto are also popular with younger users, which has always been Wealthsimple’s target market but proved to be a tough nut to crack.

Even though the company attracted billions in assets, it was a tiny fraction of the total wealth-management market. Switching rates, which measure the likelihood that someone is willing to leave their main financial institution, remain stubbornly low. In 2020, management consultancy Accenture pegged the switching rate for a primary financial account in Canada at only 4 per cent.

Yet as the company grows, it seems inevitable that it will move further from its roots – some of which are still exposed on Wealthsimple’s website. In a section promoting its robo-adviser, the company writes: “History shows that when you try to predict the future – by picking stocks, for example – rather than investing in a highly diversified way, you are more likely to underperform the market.”",2021-10-07 03:59:54

**Authors Speculative Predictions for What is to Come:**

1. Ether will continue an upward trend throughout 2021. Corrections of \~30% as price moves up, reaching newer local highs. A \~50% correction will only occur in the case of a black swan event. 

2. After proof-of-stake, there will be a “sell the news” event, a correction no larger than \~20-30%. 

3. Ether is headed to a long-term price range of $20,000, the maximum price between 2022 and 2023 will likely overshoot this figure due to speculation, new market entrants, hype.

4. After the bubble pops, ether will stabilize at \~$20,000 over the long term, after 2022.

Market Cap does not equal Realized Cap. Miners are hodling more and more these days especially in a bullish market. There doesn't need to be an extra $40.5 million in new demand every day to keep the prices ""stable.""

hg0eecc,hipaces,124,"Not OP but my answer would be that Ethereum has concrete protocol upgrades scheduled over the next 6 months which will not only reduce issuance (which is what happens with Bitcoin's halvenings) but do a few other key things as well.  Here's what's going on with ETH:

1.  The Merge--when ETH goes from PoW to PoS, the ability to withdraw staked (and earned) ETH will not be enabled immediately.  Technically, issuance will still happen, it's just that stakers won't be able to sell their newly issued ETH.  This period shouldn't last for more than 3 months but there is a thinking that this ""in between"" period will further contribute to the supply shock.
2. Layer 2's are being rolled out--Layer 2 solutions on Ethereum are a key component for improved scaling.  They are already rolling out (Optimism &amp; Arbitrum for example) and more are coming.  So, unlike Bitcoin which is completely stagnant, the performance of the Ethereum blockchain is improving.  This can't be understated because it means more things can be done on Ethereum.  It's like when internet speeds became fast enough to support streaming video which allowed companies like YouTube &amp; Netflix to be created.
3. PoS is much more environmentally friendly than PoW.  This hasn't much to do with the actual blockchain, more just the social aspect of investing.  Bitcoin has come under scrutiny for its environmental impact.  When Ethereum goes to Proof of Stake, it will have a much stronger social &amp; environmental story to tell.
4. PoS itself rewards hoarding of ETH.  With Bitcoin, all you can do is hold it.  If the price doesn't go up, you're screwed.  If the price of BTC does go up, you're pressured to sell it because that's all you can do with it--buy low, sell high.  With ETH, holding it will earn you 4-7% (or more) ETH per year so there's an incentive to not sell one's ETH, even if it's price rises.

&gt; deposit 0.1 coin with 10 different institutions to get 5% APY, live on that $50,000 per year zero risk zero stress.

Since you won't have 1 Bitcoin, you won't be able to get that return.

hfzr4nm,SenatusSPQR,85,"Good post, thanks for doing this series. I think that, unfortunately, you based most of this off of the whitepaper, right? In Nano's case the whitepaper is terribly outdated, in several ways. For example, as far as I know Nano doesn't use UDP anymore. Some other small corrections:

&gt; In Nano's block lattice, each user account has a blockchain. These blockchains are responsible for maintaining the records of user accounts, while the main blockchain only holds a record of these ledgers. 

Every node actually stores all transactions so far. There is experimental pruning for non-representative nodes, but in terms of storage usage Nano isn't that much different to Bitcoin and such.

&gt; In the event of a conflict, the nodes with the right to vote - the result of using the delegated Proof of Stake - resolve the transaction.

This used to be the case in the earliest versions of Nano, but nowadays every transaction is voted on. Not just conflict transactions.

&gt; The best hot wallets for NANO are Exodus, WeNano, TrustWallet and Atomic Wallet. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger or Trezor is the right choice.

Exodus and Trust are quite terrible with Nano. Natrium is great, and www.nault.cc as well.

I'll also take this opportunity to plug my ""[Basics of Nano](https://senatus.substack.com/p/the-basics-of-nano-why-its-such-an)"" article!",2021-10-10 00:48:36

hg9rver,maroonblood94,150,"I’m not relying on Bitcoin to lift me out of poverty as much as I’m relying on it to be a form of revolt against the corrupt central banks. Money rules the world. And the central banks and world governments have kept the masses (us) economically enslaved for decades through inflationary fiat. Bitcoin is the antithesis of the fiat system that the top 0.1% want to continue to use to control our lives, our time, and our energy. I’m relying on Bitcoin to be the primary tool for a financial revolution, because the days of armed revolutions are over. Governments these days are simply to powerful for their citizenry to overthrow them physically. It has to be done through monetary change. And I hope and believe that Bitcoin is the vehicle for that. If we can create a more financially free society with Bitcoin, then the opportunities for wealth building will be endless. The Bitcoin mindset drives ingenuity, responsibility, and learning. 

As far as lifting myself out of a low paying job, that will be a result of me finding ways to add more value to society through some type of skill. I’ve chosen the path of electrician, and will be beginning school soon. Most low paying jobs are only low paying because they don’t offer a valuable skill. Whether it’s college, trade school, or something else, I would encourage you to lift yourself out of poverty by learning and refining a specific skill. 

Yes, Bitcoin may lift us out of poverty someday. But that shouldn’t be your main plan. Build up your own life, and let Bitcoin do it’s thing. I have no doubt it will continue to explode. But we have to focus on building up our own lives in the meantime.",2021-10-12 05:28:05

hgbxwpc,SenatusSPQR,101,"As more general advice, I'd say it's very important here to write a well-crafted message. People sometimes think Nano enthusiasts are just an army of spambots - copy pasting a simple message of ""please take Nano payments"" to a bunch of businesses isn't going to help improve that image. Not saying that's what you're planning by the way, just putting it out there as general advice.

What I generally try to do is research whatever company/individual I'm contacting a bit and try to make it clear how Nano could help them, rather than how they could help Nano. I'll add some examples, maybe they're of inspiration to some.

-----------

To Bitpay:

Hi xxx,

Hope it's okay to email you here. I'm messaging because I admire your service, and would love to see Nano added to the payment options. Not only is it the top request on your requests page (https://bitpay.canny.io/feature-request), but from being a rather active member of the Nano community I also know there are countless businesses looking for easy ways to integrate Nano payments (since it's genuinely meant as a payment cryptocurrency). I feel like there's a win-win here, with Nano's huge community willing to spend and many merchants looking for a solution.

It also seems like a good one for Bitpay to integrate as transactions on the Nano chain are instant and feeless, so settlement risk is far lower than with other coins.

If there's anything I can do to help, or anything more we as the Nano community can do to show how much we'd love for BitPay to add Nano, please let me know.

Kind regards,

xxx

To a journalist:

Dear xxx,

I'll try to keep this short. A fair bit has been written on the environmental hazards of Bitcoin investment. I feel like many stories are missing the main points, which in my opinion are two-fold:

* Every bit of investment into Bitcoin increases Bitcoin's price, and thereby increases emissions. A higher Bitcoin price = more profitable mining = more miners joining = more emissions.
* There are alternatives to Bitcoin that offer superior utility, and are green at literal orders of magnitude less energy usage.

The way I see it, this means that anyone investing in Bitcoin, be they individuals or institutions, is actively contributing to increasing emissions. I find this rather unforgiveable, because even if you believe that cryptocurrency offers value to the world (which I think it does), Bitcoin is a worse solution.

For more information, not just on Bitcoin's energy usage but also on alternatives such as Nano that offer this increased utility with far lower energy usage, see for example https://senatus.substack.com/p/the-environmental-idiocy-of-bitcoin-investment-8c5cd36f802a and https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/3/17/climate-concerns-to-crime-bitcoins-dark-side-draws-scrutiny.

I see this as a rather clear-cut case where we can cut a lot of emissions, and I think it'd be interesting to read a piece that points out how investing in Bitcoin contributes to emissions, and perhaps quantifies the effect of divesting from Bitcoin into Nano. Even if just a small percentage of investors see the idiocy of this, given the large total emissions of Bitcoin this would already have a noticeable effect in terms of decreasing emissions.

Either way, thanks for hearing me out.

Kind regards,

xxx

To the Woz (Steve Wozniak):

Hi Steve,

First of all, great fan. Not just of the tech you've built, but of the way you approach life. I also love the way you approach philanthropy, and what you've started with Efforce. With that out the way, let me explain to you about a way I think you can further help better the world, at very low cost and effort to yourself.

As you're well aware, crypto is here to stay. Unfortunately, some crypto such as Bitcoin have a massive footprint and negative effect on the world. A recent Nature papure found that Bitcoin's emissions alone could push global warming above 2°C - https://nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0321-8. There are many more articles like this one. To put this into a relatable perspective - a single Bitcoin transaction equals ~3000 miles of electric driving. A round trip from London to Amsterdam, by plane, doesn't emit half as much CO2 as a single Bitcoin transaction does. Yesterday, there were 350,000 Bitcoin transactions.

If Bitcoin was adding massive value, it might even be worth it. But it isn't. It's got $10+ fees and long waiting times, so no one is using it as currency.

The way I see it, we can, in your words, ""improve our energy footprint and lower our energy consumption without changing our habits."" I think that this really hits the nail on the head. People don't want to give anything up. Electric cars are only now getting good enough for people to see them as a realistic substitute to ICE cars.

I think that in crypto terms, Nano is this improvement. It's able to do whatever Bitcoin does, but about 1000x better. It scales better, it's feeless (by design), transactions are confirmed instantly, its initial distribution was done by giving it away for free, and most importantly for this email - it's very energy efficient. See also this article: https://senatusspqr.medium.com/fight-the-climate-crisis-usenano-6e7c22d45b0e.

So why do I email you about this? I think that someone with your standing looking into Nano and speaking about it positively would mean the world. It would legitimize it far more as an alternative to Bitcoin, meaning more people will use Nano and hopefully less of Bitcoin. This literally directly impacts CO2 emissions.

To look into it - you can try it for free by getting a free wallet from the app store (Natrium recommended) and grabbing free Nano from a faucet (like https://freenanofaucet.com/). Takes under two minutes. To read more about it, there's https://docs.nano.org/what-is-nano/overview/. Alternatively, while I'm not actually part of the Nano team (just an enthusiast) I'd gladly put you in touch with Nano's founder, Colin LeMahieu.

Anyway, apologies for the email out of the blue, but I think it's incredibly important that people around the world have access to a self-sovereign currency but even more importantly, to do whatever we can to save the planet.

All the best, and keep on being the awesome dude you are.

Kind regards,

xxx

The Giving Block:

First off - fantastic initiative you have set up. I love what you guys are doing, props to you. The reason I'm contacting is because I'd love for you to add Nano to your crypto donation options. The reason for this is that Nano is morally strongly aligned with the goals of the Giving Block, and offers feeless + green transfers. Whereas Bitcoin has rather high energy usage, Nano barely uses any energy. See https://nanoportal.cc/ for more info on it. Nano was given away rather than sold/mined, and still today is often given away (mostly to people in Venezuela, Nigeria and such) by the community.

In other words, I believe Nano fits with the spirit of the Giving Block very well. The community would love to be able to donate to for example CO2 reduction charities because most people in the community feel strongly about this, and being able to do so in Nano would be fantastic.

I'm just a community enthusiast who believes secure, feeless and green money is a fantastic thing to have in the world. That being said, my technical knowledge is limited. I'll therefore add the email for the Nano Foundation (a non-profit) who can help integrate Nano, in case you're interested: partners@nano.org.

Thanks for your time, again thanks for the good you are doing for the world, and I hope this message was worth your time.

Kind regards,

hgn55b3,pseudoHappyHippy,498,"Unfortunately I need to add a dash of doubtium to this juicy hopium.

So, first of all, I agree with the general premise that BTC growth is best described in logarithmic space, and that there should exist some logarithmic band that captures BTC's oscillations. This band should have a convex (getting less steep) curve, which you can see quite clearly in any logarithmic representation of BTC like the rainbow chart above. That is a more mathematical way to say each cycle has diminishing returns, which is a generally accepted fact at this point. So far, so good.

Here's the thing:

The exact shape of the logarithmic regression bands is arbitrary. What I mean by that is that the width and steepness of the bands is controlled by arbitrary parameters, and the only reason the rainbow band looks the exact way it does in ""the"" BTC rainbow chart that is always cited is that the person who first made this chart tweaked those arbitrary parameters until the logarithmic band they produced was as close of a match to the BTC price history channel as they could get at the time.

Looking at the rainbow chart with the advantage of hindsight, it looks like the parameters could use some tweaking to fit the data better. Specifically, note how the top of the 2017 cycle perfectly reached the top edge of the red band, while the 2013 cycle goes above the red band. Because we're in logarithmic space, that little spike above the red band actually represents a **doubling** in price. I believe that the first ever BTC bull run in 2011 that is not included in this graph goes even higher above the top edge of this particular log regression band than the 2013 one.

What this means is that the entire logarithmic band (the rainbow) is not curving down hard enough to reflect historical reality. In other words, this famous old rainbow band was too optimistic about the severity of the diminishing returns phenomenon. 

To re-fit the logarithmic bands so that both 2013 and 2017 reach the top of the red band, we would have to adjust a parameter that makes the entire logarithmic rainbow more convex (flatten out faster), which would curve down future price projections for the whole rainbow.

Instead of doing that complicated set of calculations right now, let's use a quick heuristic to create a second projection to balance yours out.

By quickly eyeballing it, it looks like the 2013 top went about two color bands' worth above the top edge of the red band. Since 2017 went to the top edge of the red band, it went about two bands less high than the 2013 top. If we extrapolate, we could predict that this cycle will reach two bands below 2017. With this assumption, we should expect this cycle to peak at the top of the 3rd highest band. If we follow your assumption that the peak will come in mid-December, then this heuristic puts the peak at **$100,000**.

Another way to put this is: imagine we widened the bands so that the 2013 peak reaches the top of the red band, rather than going above it. In such a scenario, expecting the 2017 cycle to reach the top of the red band would be a prediction of $38,000 BTC in 2017, whereas it only reached $19,000.

Now, I'm not saying that my projection here will be any more accurate than yours. Who knows. In any case, logarithmic regression bands are just one of dozens of useful heuristics for gauging Bitcoin cycles. Their particular curvature is just determined by the parameters chosen by the person graphing the curves. This particular log regression band chart happens to be quite famous, but also too optimistic about rates of return by a factor of about 100% per cycle (at least according to the historical data it is trying to fit).

As for your secondary point where you simply project the 343% gains of mid-Oct to mid-Dec 2017 onto the current situation: this projection ignores diminishing returns. It is a mistake to assume that the % gains of one cycle will be equal to that of the last. Every crypto cycle (granted, this is just the 4th) has seen significantly diminished returns. 

If % gains from one cycle to the next were constant, then logarithmic bands that capture BTC oscillations like the rainbow chart above would all be straight channels aiming up and to the right, with no downward curve.

Here are a few quick numbers: 

The 2013 peak was a 40x over the 2011 peak, but the 2017 peak was only a 16x over the 2013 peak. 

The 2013 peak was a 552x the previous cycle floor, but the 2017 peak was only a 97x over the previous cycle floor.

Anyways, my point is that diminishing returns are a fact, and they are very significant, making your linear projection invalid.

BTC might make it to $197,500 this cycle, I don't know. The cycle also might get rejected at 100k, or even lower. In any case, don't get too drawn in to any one heuristic. They are just that: heuristics.

In the end, this is just a rainbow that someone painted with some math, and they didn't even paint inside the lines too well.",2021-10-15 03:36:37

No. Hedges against inflation don't have to be terribly complicated, anything with sustained positive real returns works just fine. In practice, something like an index fund is plenty.

&gt;I hear how gold and perhaps bitcoin are “hedges against inflation”, but never hear a logical theory behind the claim.

As far as more ""active"" hedges go, you want goods that rise in value when inflation goes up. A lot of commodities work fine for that.

&gt;I could borrow $10 million, buy all the cool stuff that I would ever need for the rest of my life, and when repayment comes due, the hyperinflation would mean that I would be paying back almost nothing. But I still have all my cool stuff.

hhado4e,Tijok,429,"\[From an [established work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilith%27s_Brood), this is an AU timeline, just having fun\]

I still remember how the bark lanced into my palms as I pushed up off the ground, the swingset and slide reassuring me that I was back at Huntington Elementary. I recall being baffled by the notepad in my hand, and the pencil in the other. I can still feel the fear as I realized I had no idea what had happened for the last (as I learned later) four minutes, or how I landed on the ground beneath the maple tree. The tears come just as easy today as they did twenty years ago when that terror comes back. I still fight it down as I did then, never wanting to show just how strange this - I... was.  
  
Of course, it's a lot easier to be strange now. After following the directions on my notepad to ""invest in Yahoo, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Bitcoin"", here in 2021 I am no longer weird, I'm wealthy enough to be eccentric. I've known the message wasn't a figment or a siezure since the $121 dollars my dad begrudgingly invested in Yahoo's IPO became $1,273. Of course, that one went a little sour later, perhaps the Yahoo of my messenger's future did a bit better.   
  
Either way, I never told anyone about the second part of the message, the part from a future I am determined not to see, ""Spend on defense. They do not come in peace."" I've also never forgotten about it, so when Twitter erupted with live video and images of the massive dropships being met by government officials from around the globe, I knew that it was time. While the forests growing from the top of the ships swayed as helicopters inspected them, and Presidents, Kings, and Prime Ministers shook hands with tentacled visitors, (with varying levels of comfort) I locked down my perimeter and put security on high alert. When the joyous cries that the Oankali, ""were here to trade, and respected life above all else"" echoed across TikTok, I knew that my preparations were only going to be the beginning of what I needed.

Let's say you want to buy the dip. Okay, what are you going to hold onto?

\-Holding cash when inflation is hitting 5% is a bad idea. Four years like this and you're down 20% for a dip that might not happen. 

\-Fine, so you hold bonds in order to get a better return. Not only do they get reamed by inflation, when rates go up bond prices will collapse. 

\-Oh yeah, well I'll put it in real estate. Locking in 30 years of bottom dollar interest rates might not be such a bad idea. But the flipside of low interest rates has been very high list prices. If rates go up, house prices might not do so well. And well, a lot can change in 30 years. A house in Detroit probably seemed like a blue chip buy in 1960. I'm not sure it looked so good by 1990. 

\-Okay, so I'll hold gold. Well, GLD is already up around the peak it hit in the 2008 financial crisis. And even if gold is a traditional safe haven, it might not fare so well against rate hikes, which are deflationary (Volcker wasn't so great for the Hunt Bros). 

\-Oh yeah, well I'll hold bitcoin so I can be a super-billionaire when it crushes fiat. Well, a lot of holders of crypto are highly leveraged. Rate hikes won't be so great for that. And crypto has tended to be pro-cyclical not countercyclical, despite notions that it is some kind of digital gold.

hhdwdph,Etony333,116,"With Bitcoin making a new ATH today, there are probably newcomers who are checking out the scene and looking for advice. So, here goes.

First of all, cryptocurrency is not, despite what you may have heard, a get rich quick scheme. It certainly does happen that way sometimes, but the majority of the time, it takes a while. Read up on what Bitcoin actually is and how it works to give yourself a better understanding of what makes it superior to centralized systems.

You need discipline. Lots and lots and lots of it. This is a very volatile market, and double digit swings in either direction are commonplace, often in the same week or even the same day. 

The exact same emotion that causes you to buy due to fear of missing out also causes you to sell for a loss when the market tanks. Hard as it may be, you should really try to avoid this. It is imperative to make a plan and stick to it. Even those who have been doing this for years have difficulty with that, especially when it comes to taking profits.

There's often a purpose to the market swinging one way and then the other. Since liquidity on exchanges is often rather low, those with the means to do so often try to push the market one way and then the other in order to hit people's stop losses. Not that you shouldn't remain vigilant when big swings happen, but you should never panic because of it. It often quickly reverses.

Until you know what you are doing, I would advise against trying to trade. The person buying when you sell and selling when you buy often has a lot more money and a lot more experience than you do, and trading is a zero sum game. The safer option is simply to buy and hold. Paper trade if you'd like, and compare it to how well you're doing by hodling. Chances are, you'd be worse off by trading. Revisit it when you have more experience.

Finally, and the most important point of all: do NOT invest even one penny more than you are entirely comfortable with losing. The market looks great right now, and maybe it'll stay that way. But maybe it won't, and you do not want to be missing rent payments or losing your collateral because the market took a downturn. Assume that anything you put in is gone on the off chance that it is.

Glad to have you aboard, and I hope you'll stick around even during a bear market. Those who invest heavily during a bear have never regretted it if they kept their investment in.",2021-10-21 02:28:24

As litecoin shares the same lightning network and value can seamless swap between bitcoin and litecoin it can act not only as overflow in peak settlement periods, but also protect against spam attacks and even reach mutual security reinforcement with bitcoin since to take down the lightning system would require a successful attack on both underlying networks to bring anything down.

I was looking at the chart today and realized the last time I posted was 9/1.  Sorry about the absence.  I had some family issues going on, and they are finally done.  There was death, daughter’s wedding, 2nd birthdays, and my 35th anniversary.  My head was not in the game.  And the run up in bitcoin was boring…

Now its not boring.

I am reminded of the week after December 17, 2017.  The first futures market opened and we fell hard off the high.  We are falling today’s but I don’t think the “dip” is going to be as dramatic.

Here is today’s chart:  https://imgur.com/gallery/C3p2kBY

The formation moving upwards throughout October was steady and looked very positive.  Over the last few days it obviously shot upwards.  We had two high pole warnings in short order.  This morning we reversed back and touched the first reversal point.

The second, unresolved HPW is at $58,514—which is also the local breakdown target.  So hold on…it would not be unrealistic to go down to the second support level at $56,231.

After the launch of the fastest growing ETF, this should have been expected.  If nothing else we have seen significant growth in a very, very short time.  Taking some time to cool off is OK.  I wouldn’t be freaking out at this points.

Here are the numbers:

The formation is only 2 columns wide.  This is a tentative breakout at best.  We need to see some consolidation at this $62k+ levels.

We reversed and have taken out of the most recent High Pole Warning reversal point.

The breakdown price is at $58,514.

A breakout would occur at $67,261.  This is a very wide range.  Expect instability—either way.

Local support is at $59,690—so holding $60k looks good for now.
Second support is at $58,514.

The trend line is at $42,557.  This is 39 boxes below the box for today.  

That's it.  I hope to be posting a bit more often.  

I hope you all made more money during my absence.  (Holding would have proven lucrative!)   This weekend is when Evergrande should officially enter into default*  I cannot help think that this will have an impact on overall markets next week.  It will be interesting to see if there is any movement into bitcoin.  (I know that won’t happen in China…but stranger things have happened.)

hhjw6ww,CalligrapherOneTwo3,124,"You are obviously very new to crypto and so I will give you a quick summary of the basics. In short, no, you will not own real crypto with WealthSimple. Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage wallets, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:  
  
1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montréal which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can easily confirm their legitimacy and I have been stacking free Satoshis for a few years now.     
  
2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them ""offline"" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.  
  
3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy BTCX, ETHX or BTCC in your TFSA. With that said, you do not truly own crypto with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not the asset itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: ""not your keys, not your crypto"". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not completely insured. Big risk, but tax free/deferred in a TFSA/RRSP.  
  
4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold ""entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga"" while Quadriga held the ""keys"" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of ""not your keys, not your crypto"" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.  
  
5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, ETHX, and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the ""keys"". They are the ones who own the real asset (crypto) and simply run the fund with the crypto backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).  
  
6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the crypto-asset, it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your adjusted cost base (ACB) for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your ACB for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.  
  
7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really crypto itself, but rather, it is in the application of blockchain technology which serves as a massive global public ledger as well as the decentralization of this digital store of value combined with its independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the crypto-assets itself simply have a monetary value relative to fiat currency. Moreover, investing is simply risk management and from a risk-adjusted returns perspective, having some excellent crypto-projects is better than not having any at all while I personally see this as the 12th sector in the overall global market index.  
  
Now, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:  
  
1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its ""blockchain"".  
  
2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a ""key"" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this ""key"" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word ""seed phrase"" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word ""seed phrase"" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word ""seed phrase"" is essentially your ""keys"" to your assets on the blockchain.  
  
3. Your 24-word ""seed phrase"" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word ""seed phrase"" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your ""keys"" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin.   
  
4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word ""seed phrase"" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word ""seed phrase"" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your ""keys"". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your ""keys"", never give it out. Period.

If u have 100 bitcoins and want to send me 5 bitcoins, under the hood, ur wallet sends me all ur 100 Bitcoin, I keep my 5 bitcoins and I give u back 95 Bitcoin as a UTXO or change.

This is why for a Bitcoin transaction from one wallet to another, there is 1 input and 2 outputs. The input being the senders wallet address and one of their UTXOs. The 1st output is the receivers wallet address and the amount of bitcoins u want to send them. The 2nd output is the address of the senders wallet where the “change” of the transaction is sent. This 2nd output is the TRANSACTION OUTPUT that the sender can use to send bitcoins in their next transaction.  

Now u might think. Why does the 1st input and the 2nd output contain different addresses if the “change” has to be sent back to the receiver. This is because, nowadays, wallets add an extra layer of security by using 1 private-public key pair address for a single transaction. This means every time u send some Bitcoin, ur wallet creates a new address for the balance to be received in. This address is then used for the next transaction and the process is repeated again. This is all done automatically by the app that manages ur wallet whether it is Exodus, Coinbase Wallet or any other Bitcoin supported wallet.

Chart for Today:  https://imgur.com/gallery/atECaiD

So we continue to move downward.

The key numbers haven’t changed from yesterday.

Because of the drop we re-joined the previous formation, making it four columns wide.  This means more stability long run.

The important numbers to watch today are the local support which is in the $59,560 box right now.  In a perfect world we should bounce around there.

The second second level is $58,514 box.  That is both the breakdown point AND the unresolved high pole warning reversal box.   That could be a point where things happen.

None of this is an exact science.

Much of this appears to be profit taking from the ETF announcement.

In other news Evergrande was able to “scrape up” enough money for their coupon payment, so the danger of default was averted.  Some relief from potential problems might be in play.

Gold and silver have started another movement.  Not sure why that it.  Inflation is here for a while.  But I would think we would see some of that flow into Bitcoin.

hhv2j3m,yogafan00000,80,"BTC.X is the ticker symbol to track the USD/BTC pair.  Typically you would use a crypto exchange to buy and sell, like Kraken or Coinbase although more brokerages are starting to offer crypto holding services.  If you want to HODL your keys, you need to have a Bitcoin wallet on your phone or desktop in order to transfer the coins.  It's technical.  You pay fees when you buy and sell and also when you transfer to wallets.  Typically not available for registered accounts like TFSA or RRSP.

BTCX is the ticker for Galaxy Bitcoin ETF available only to Canadians in your brokerage account.  They hold a certain amount of Bitcoins and your shares represent a certain interest in these Bitcoins.  The fees are structured similar to other ETF.  You will not be allowed to take ownership of any coins.   There are two versions of this product, one is hedged to the USD and the other is not.  The biggest advantage is that these are available inside your TFSA/RRSP.  There are other variations of Bitcoin ETF's in Canada:  BTCC, EBIT, BTCQ and probably more.  They each have their own configuration and you will have to research each one to decide if it's right for your investment objectives.

With Bitcoin, you are the custodian (unless you leave your balance on the Crypto Exchange, which has it's own set of issues).  If you lose your computer or phone with no backup, you have no recourse.  No one can help you.  Your coins and wealth are gone.  It's 100% your responsibility to ensure your assets are secure and safe.

With BTCX (or any other holding ETF) you are paying for custody services via their MER fees.  You could possibly sue or have other recourse if they get hacked or do an exitscam, but, of course, it would still be a bad time.

Be aware some ETF's don't actually hold Bitcoin such as the new American ETF: BITO.  They only hold futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

1. That isn't how owning bitcoin works.  The network of miners creates that value (whatever it may be), and you own no part in that network when you buy bitcoin.  You're their _customer_, not _owner_.
2. Bitcoin is properly understood as a _fiat_ currency, not a [representative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_money) one.  There is virtually no intrinsic or use value, and instead, the price comes virtually entirely from a) speculation and b) adoption.  Bitcoin can never have nearly enough adoption to justify its price, and as you know speculation is negative sum and you can't reliably make money from it.

&gt; Or in ethereum's case, the smart contracts can probably create some sort of value

1. Call them what they are: computer programs being run by a ludicrously expensive cloud provider.  Once you understand that, the obvious question is ""why would anyone pay five orders of magnitude more for exactly the same thing except the speculation""?

hi3256v,Difficult-Stick3596,557,"I’m an ex-nuclear physicist who used to work in the field of nuclear data that was used for modeling nuclear reactors, so not directly but was close to the world of nuclear power. 

I find the idea of mining bitcoin with nuclear power bigger than the recent hype over renewables.

Nuclear was always limited to the base load (which is quite low compared to peak load), due to very long lag to scaling up and down power output for nuclear. So basically nuclear was limited to base load and other power sources which could ramp up and down faster filled the gap between base load and peak demand. Nuclear is by far the most energy efficient fuel by density and among the cleanest of fuels when consider all environmental impacts, but was always limited to this base load. France could get around this and get to &gt;80% nuclear by selling power to neighbors, but this was really  geo hack and said more about their neighbors energy sources rather than some way everyone could be majority nuclear.

Back then some 15 years ago there was some push (well I attended a few talks at LLNL where I worked) for using hydrogen fuel cells (which was competing at the time with EVs for car power), as a way to store the excess energy produced by nuclear so it could take a bigger fraction of power consumption above base load. The excess could be used to produce hydrogen fuel cells which essentially store the energy to be used later in vehicles. This idea fell through when EVs won out over hydrogen as the next-gen car fuel.

Bitcoin mining is bringing this idea back and could lead to a resurgence in new nuclear power (which is the only real solution to clean up our energy grid) and make it more stable. I hope this leads to increased nuclear power usage and incentives to build modern style nuclear reactors which are orders of magnitude safer than the old reactors which give nuclear a bad image and should have been retired decades ago.",2021-10-26 15:28:12

Now, using some of them to buy a house gets tricky, but he can trace that shit AND show that a) that portion of the downpayment or mortgage was paid with premarital assets and b) that the appreciation in the house value can be tied to that as well.

They WILL punish friend for that because he comes with “unclean hands” and, frankly, they’ll want to know what other shady shit he did.

hi8i9ga,Miliean,3741,"So most businesses operate by buying a thing then selling that thing for more money.  But the act of operating a business is that you need to bring some value to that transaction, even if that value is that you bought in bulk and sold individually.  

But if you are buying and selling things for profit (or loss) but are not actually doing anything to the things then it's not a business you are operating, it's an investment.

Houses, stocks, bonds, Pokémon cards, beanie babies, bitcoin.  These are all things that a person might buy, hold for a time, then sell for a profit or loss.  These are capital transactions. 

So lets say I buy some hot sneakers for $100.  They're pretty cool but I know that they are actually pretty rare and I think the value will go up so I just put them in the closest and wait. A year later those sneakers are worth $1,000.

If I sell the sneakers, I have a ""realized"" capital gain of $900.  And I get taxed on that gain.  However, if I don't sell them there's no realized gain and no tax effects.

The act of selling the thing is known as a ""taxable event"" and it triggers a capital gain or loss and there's a tax treatment there. 

So people have investments, those investments increase in value, but unless the investments get sold there's no taxable event and the government collects no taxes. 

Lets say I bought 100 sneakers for $100 a pair.  They raise in value to $$5,000 a pair.  I have spent $10,000 for something that is now worth $500,000.  But again, nothing has been sold and therefore no taxes have been collected.  

Again this is all how the ""normal"" capital gains  system is intended to work and that's how it works in almost every country in the world, not just the US. 

People who are REALLY wealthy, get around paying taxes in many ways but one of them is that they rarely ever actually sell their investments.  How do they afford to live? Well they take these large investments and use them as colorectal on loans.

So my $500,000 sneaker collection, I approach a bank and offer it as colorectal on a $50,000 loan at 5% interest for 1 year.  I use that $50,000 to live on for the year.  After the year my sneaker collection is now worth $700,000, I repeat this process by borrowing more money against my sneakers. I borrow enough to repay my initial loan + interest ($52,500) and I borrow enough to pay my living expenses for year 2 (another $50,000).

So I've now lived for 2 years off my sneaker collection, but I haven't actually sold a single sneaker.  There have been no taxable events and no taxes have been paid or are even owed.  This is all 100% legal and is how most wealthy people live day to day.  

Eventually you might think I will need to sell the sneakers and pay the bank.  But, no, I do not.  As long as the sneakers keep raising in value faster than I'm borrowing against them the bank is perfectly happy to repeat this process forever. So 10 years from now my sneakers might be worth $3,000,000 and I'll owe the bank like $1,500,000.  So the bank is perfectly happy to repeat this process basically forever, as long as my sneakers keep going up in value.

An ""unrealized"" capital gains tax is a tax that happens when the value of my investments increase even if I have not actually sold them.  So back to the sneakers.

I buy them for $10,000 and after year 1 they are worth $500,000.  Regardless of what borrowing shenanigans I get up to to avoid tax, the government sees the raise in value as income and so I get taxed on it.  So even if I have not sold a single sneaker the government says, you've had a $490,000 unrealized gain, we tax that at 15% so you owe $73,500 in taxes. The government does not accept sneakers as payment, only dollars, so you need to borrow that money from the bank or you need to sell some sneakers. 

So to recap.  A capital gain is when you own a thing that goes up in value (and a loss is when it goes down).  A realized gain is when you actually turn that into dollars by selling the thing.  An unrealized gain is when you have not yet sold the thing.  Normal capital gains tax only applies once you sell it and realize the gain.  The new proposed tax will be on very, very, wealthy people who have not actually turned those large investments into cash.",2021-10-27 20:48:30

hi8awo3,therealnumpty,206,"So basically some people or organisations choose to buy and sell bitcoin (or other crypto's) on the spot market and others choose to trade on the derivatives market.

The spot market is just buying a set amount of the currency at the current market price. So if you buy say $1k worth of bitcoin when the price is 60k, you get 1 60th of a coin.

The derivatives market is different, whereby you don't buy the actual currency, you buy a contract that requires you to buy a specific amount of the currency at a specific price.

Let's say the current price is 60k. You can take out a contract that says you will buy 1bitcoin for 70k at the end of this month. Likewise the person on the other end will sell you that 1 bitcoin at that price. This is essentially a bet that the price will rise above 70k, because if it doesn't, you would basically be buying the bitcoin for more than it's actually worth (and who wants to do that?). In this case you are ""long"" bitcoin. 

So when you take out the contract, you might pay 20k for it up front but the rest is on margin ( basically a loan). Your contract will have a value based on the current price and the price on the contract. So if for example the price of bitcoin goes to 80k, your contract is worth 10k (the difference between the asset value and the buy price on the contract). 

But if the price of bitcoin falls, the value of the contract also falls. If it falls below a certain level, you will either have to put more money up to keep the contract running (This is called a margin call). If you don't, you get liquidated, which is where the value of your contract goes to 0, and the person on the other side takes the money you've put in and the contract is void.

This is basically what's happened here. Lots of people were making bets that the price would rise (these people were ""long"") then the price fell, so all of their contracts became worthless and they've lost their money",2021-10-27 19:23:26

2) Use coinjoin wallets that can't steal your btc

a) Wasabi wallet https://wasabiwallet.io/ (best , but requires at least 0.1 BTC to coinjoin) , this will shortly change with wasabi 2.0

b) Samourai wallet whirlpool

https://samouraiwallet.com/whirlpool

c) joinmarket (good but more complicated to use)

https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver


--------------

As long as you don't immediately need to spend the solution is very simple

1) Buy bitcoin (even from a regulated exchange with fees of 0.35% to 0.5%)

2) Withdraw it to temporary wallet A (Example- mobile open source hot wallet)

3) Within 1-4 hours of receiving it in wallet A send to wallet B(example - your hardware wallet) and never send transactions backwards from wallet B to wallet A. Send entire amount every time you do this to insure that the exchange cannot associate your Unique withdrawal addresses with each transaction.

Note- you can technically use a single wallet and use ""coin control "" feature to manually separate out your UTXOs but the above is an idiot proof method to avoid mistakes

Why?

You can easily spend Bitcoin privately in many ways , including just using a lightning wallet today . Since you are just concerned about long term privacy you are better off simply creating evidence immediately for plausible deniability that the address you withdrew to (assumed by exchanges and regulators to likely be yours) no longer has the bitcoin and those bitcoin could have been spent , lost, sold , used within a small window of time where no or an insignificant amount of capital gains would have occurred.",2021-10-28 22:42:05

hihiip9,Intention-Jazzlike,109,"Yes, bitcoin might actually cancel loans. Like you said, by borrowing bitcoin now you will owe a lot more later.

With fiat your money becomes worth less over time and it's impossible to save up faster than the price increases in housing we have seen over the last decade. So people have to take on increasingly bigger loans to get the capital to be able to purchase a house. Lenders are willing to lend out fiat for the loan so they get to counteract inflation. Thanks to inflation your loan becomes easier to pay off every year, so it all works out.

Bitcoin actually flips the system around. When you start working as a young adult your bitcoin is not worth ""much"", but keep saving up over the years and your bitcoin start to become worth more. With a deflationary system, saving actually gets rewarded instead of spending. Eventually you net worth will be enough to purchase a house, rewarding the work you put in early on in your younger years.

So we go from a system of instant gratification, having to take a huge loan to pay for housing right now and then having to pay it off for the rest of your life (like an extended credit card debt from hell), to delayed gratification, having to save now to be able to purchase a house later on (without going into debt).",2021-10-29 16:29:35

I believe given time this is a truly worthwhile investment and I will add into this regularly as I would a Roth IRA or other long term investment.

This is basically my savings account, but with much better returns.",2021-10-29 04:52:06
hieae3n,bitusher,97,"The answer depends upon multiple variables. Here is some general advice.

1)	Do you have high interest debt (5% and higher) and no savings?

If the answer is Yes - Do not invest in any Bitcoin.

2)	Do you have any credit card debt and fiat savings?

If the answer is Yes ,than at minimum pay off all your credit card debt with fiat savings unless you are in debt to such a degree and plan on filing bankruptcy. Do not invest in Bitcoin until you have paid off all high interest debt

3)	Have a lot of low interest credit card debt (below 5%) and no fiat savings?

You should make a budget , cut expenses, and simultaneously start paying off your debt(unless you plan to file chapter 7 bankruptcy) , start saving a fiat emergency fund, and start buying Bitcoin.

4)	Have no debt and no fiat savings?

You should make a budget , cut expenses, start simultaneously saving for 6-12 months worth of living expenses in fiat emergency fund (only stable forms of fiat, obviously not the Argentinian peso or Venezuelan bolivar) and invest in Bitcoin, and seriously consider investing in stocks(preferable an index fund ETF like SPDR) or a IRA.

5) You have a large amount of fiat savings and no debt and want to know if its best to dollar cost average invest or invest it all immediately?

The answer almost always is to make a plan and invest 100% of the fiat (not including your emergency fund) immediately in a diversified portfolio of investments that are non correlated (land, stocks, Bitcoin, businesses with positive cash flow) . It is often impossible to time the market and those that invest earlier will gain the most compound interest. The reason why dollar cost average investment is popular and a fine strategy is merely because most people don't have a large amount of fiat to invest upfront so invest a little each time they are paid.

Here is a useful tool for you - https://dcabtc.com

Thus if you get paid twice a month than what you should do is buy some Bitcoin immediately twice a month and also in addition set buy limit orders on an exchange for 5-10% below spot price. If those orders do not get filled by  the following paycheck than buy your set amount and reset the buy limit orders for 5-10% below spot price from the current market price.
The reason for this is 2 fold:

1)	you can auto pickup savings with BTC volatility on the dips which is psychologically rewarding

2)	If a large amount of people create large amounts of Buy limit support than BTC becomes more stable unit of account and more liquid leading to more investor confidence and making BTC more of a currency(less volatility = better unit of account) and thus increases the likelihood your investment will continue appreciating in value.


The reason having a fiat savings account is so important is it not only will it save you if you lose a job or have an unexpected car expense or medical bill, but that it makes you a more rational investor that is less stressed out by the volatility in your more risky investments like Bitcoin. Bitcoin historically has had at least 2 bear markets lasting a little over 1 year thus you need to be prepared to not be forced to sell at a loss for at least 2 years to give yourself enough of a buffer.",2021-10-29 01:13:14

There are 2 QR codes, so...

DO NOT SHARE THE LARGER QR code, nor the longer string of upper/lower case letters and numbers with anyone.   Do not take a photo with your phone either.

It is OK to share the SMALLER public key (aka address) which again is the smaller QR code especially if you want to use it to check your balance.  Visit this site, for example, https://www.blockchain.com/explorer

Ideally, you should set up an air gapped machine that runs electrum.   For example, here is a site which explains in all detail how to setup a couple of Raspberry PI machines.

https://armantheparman.medium.com/how-to-set-up-a-raspberry-pi-zero-air-gapped-running-latest-version-of-electrum-desktop-wallet-85e59ecaddc0

Again, please, please, please be careful and take your time!

Congratulations, too, by the way!",2021-10-30 12:05:02

hilgk0p,buyongmafanle,287,"Here's some brutal honesty from someone reading your posting history. Your problem is not saving for FIRE. Your problem is you. You seem to have a large amount of issues in your life that you haven't worked through yet. 

Your exact words and the essence of my reply to you comes from this post of yours:

&gt;I avoided addressing my insecurities and instead stuck with something I knew ""best."" I didn't know how to increase my skills due to several mental handicaps, so I took what I could do and cut my expenses down.

&gt;My biggest goal in life was to date. I lost a lot of weight in high school, but my social anxiety got the best of me. I lived with my parents for too long and so I just focused on saving money.

&gt;And then the routines kept going forward and now here I am. It was like I just woke up.

&gt;20 years of my life wasted. 8 year old me should have been focusing on having fun and getting better at socializing instead of trying to save money.

&gt;Another thing: past the age of 10, I have never been hugged. It isn't like I fear it, it just never happened. And there is a loneliness to it. Like a deep craving for physical contact. But still, for whatever reason, I avoid it. Only acceptable touch was a ""business handshake.""

&gt;My entire life can be summed up with one word: avoidance.

That's rough to read. Life can be rough. I can say that I was absolutely born lucky and that I haven't had to deal with some of the issues you have. To that, you can take my advice with a grain of salt.

From here on out, though, I will commence with the advice.

Your life looks like shit because your past has led you to this point. The things you've done and have chosen to do in the past are what got you here. You're no longer 18 and are in full control of your destiny. If you want things to change, you have to change them. 

You say that you're too old now to change your life. Too old to change the direction of your life. That you're staring down the end of life because of all the things you missed out on or didn't do when you were young. To that I say, you have no clue what you're talking about. 

You're 28. To you that sounds old because it's the oldest you've ever been. I'm 40, does that make me a fossil? 

My brother is 44 this year. He was divorced at 42, had his bank cleaned out by his ex-wife, she took everything that wasn't nailed down. He started out with LESS than you have at 42. Do you think he'd love 14 extra years to clean up the mess? You bet. But now, he's dating again, actually engaged to a nice lady and he's happy. DAMNED happy. Happier than I've seen him since our childhood. He had to hit reset at 42.

You're 28. What was I doing at 28? I was working for someone else making less than average money. My girlfriend and I at the time decided to move back home with her folks and to start our own business. So we did.

12 years later, here I am. Through a GOD DAMNED MOUNTAIN of work, I've become successful. But it was rough as fuck. Not gonna bullshit you about that. We had years in the beginning where our combined income was less than the annual average income of a single person. But we made it. Things turned around for us financially at about 33, 34. 

What does this show you? That there is no single day or job that's going to make it all better. Nobody is going to come along and sweep away your problems or worries, or offer you the greatest cushiest job on the planet just because you're the hero of your own story. 

Life is ROUGH my man. Everyone you see that's successful has faced struggles. All the other FIRE people here have had their lows, their battles, their lean years, their low points. But they've faced them, made a plan, and stuck to it. 

To me, that seems to be your major problem. You haven't made a plan. You seem to think the plan happens to you or it comes out of the sky. It doesn't. Maybe you got dealt a shit hand in life. That sucks, for real it does. You have my sympathy that your life could have gone better from 0-18. But after that point, the onus is on you. If 18-28 sucked, you had a large part in the decisions of that era. Maybe not everything that went bad was your fault, but a lot of it could have been changed with a plan, with a pathway, with goals. 

Don't set arbitrary goals. Don't say ""I'm going to hit FIRE."" You need to say ""I'm going to hit FIRE at XXXX year because from now til then I'm going to YYYY and ZZZZ every year."" 

Decide what you want your life to look like, then slowly steer the boat that direction. You aren't going to instantly undo the momentum of your past 10 years in a year. It might take 5, 10, 15 years to change your life's momentum, but I promise you it can be done. 

To a lot of people they see the success of others and forget about the hours of invisible work and sacrifice that were required to get there. It just looks like it happened from the outside. From the inside it's not so simple. It looks that way for everything that's good in life. If it's easy, it's usually not worth spending your time on. And I don't think you've come to terms with that yet. 

Because you're young. You're just 28, my friend. You've got a LOOOOOT of time to turn that boat around. Make your plan and get to it, because you aren't going to catch the next 2012 bitcoin. You won't catch Apple stock at 48 cents. You won't get Netflix or Amazon on launch day price. It's NOT going to be easy, but it can be done. So do it.",2021-10-30 11:32:11

Chart for Today: https://imgur.com/gallery/FFlga7I

Over the past two days the price bounced off the previous un-closed High Pole Warning Reversal Target and started a new column back upwards.  We are one box from matching the high on the last coiumn of Xs and two boxes from a break out.  That movement breaks the most local resistance, and approaches the last point of resistance heading upwards.

Here are the numbers:

1.  The formation is 7 columns wide.  While not wide enough to stir anyone’s loins, it is a solid formation if the price starts to stair step.  Of course if it decides to shit the bed, it means a likely 7% drop.

2. A break out would occur at $63,996.  A break down would require a price below the $57,935 box.

3. Local support is down at $58,514.  This support is rising from the lows on 10/12.  Local resistance is $64,636 (lower than the break out).  This is coming down from the highs of the 20th.

4. We are currently 38 boxes above the positive trend line at $44,286.  A mythical trade from the trend reversal would yield 44.51%.  I say mythical because the trend reversal is often not confirmed for days or weeks after it really happens.  Its merely an academic exercise.

I know today is futures expiration and it really bothers me that with the ETFs we have to worry about this crap again.  Remember in December of 2017 is when the first batch of futures came out and we were battered for that long winter?  Yeah...that sucked.

Step one: put stuff on a blockchain that people already buy.

Straight up - a decade ago Xbox announced cloud based games on the XBone at E3 (what they considered a sort of holy grail for consoles) and they were bombarded by one question:

“If my games are on the cloud, do I actually own them?” People were worried that if they lost access to their gamer tag, possibly by being banned or moving out of their current country (marketplace) or shipping out to Afghanistan and losing internet access etc. That they’d lose access to their library and Microsoft straight up did not anticipate the question and had no good answers. Players would own access to a  file owned by Xbox but not the file itself, no lending to friends, no resale, no ability to play if the server was ever shut down... people hated it.

Reggie from Nintendo filmed an impromptu piece backstage showing how to share disk based games with your friends.

Playstation added a slide to their presentation that simply said “announcing disk based games!” It got the loudest cheer of the whole convention, including the triumphant Destiney 1 reveal.

The community saw Xbox attempt to drastically shift the power balance away from the consumer and it rebuked it. The PS4 buried the XBone that holiday season and Microsoft had to reverse course.

hinl632,lucasbelaq,78,"&gt; Technically all stocks are bubbles waiting to pop. 

lol. Most stocks have realistic evaluations. Tesla is being traded like bitcoin. The p/e is 360, and looking at say, ford, it's 20, or Toyota, 8. It's being traded as a huge growth stock with tons of future profit already baked in. One bad quarter and it could pop. Especially as every manufacturer is making electric cars. 

You can argue that Tesla is a good investment, but let's not pretend it's not extremely over valuated compared to competition. Most stocks aren't bubbles and have a pretty fair evaluation. But sure, go put all your money in gamestop, tesla, and beyond meat. Good luck when they don't deliver.",2021-10-31 00:51:08
