ghn946h,jarederaj,10,"## Minor Moon Math Update

https://www.moonmath.win

We keep seeing people say stuff like, ""bitcoin is going to eat the precious metals market,"" ""Bitcoin is going to eat bonds,"" and ""Bitcoin is going to eat commodities.""

I got curious about what that means. here are some charts that show relative values based on market cap. (The way I dealt with market cap for gold and precious metals is dubious, but it's close enough for our purpose here.)

1. BTC vs Gold [ [regular](https://www.tradingview.com/x/DGETq2Pu/), [log](https://www.tradingview.com/x/bHhr9okK/)]
1. BTC vs **ALL** Precious Metals [[regular](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Zonx88V9/), [log](https://www.tradingview.com/x/VQyyIFfB/)]
1. BTC vs TSLA [[regular](https://www.tradingview.com/x/zIQp2hdq/), [log](https://www.tradingview.com/x/HZ6lhWsi/)]

I haven't found a reasonable way to do this with all bonds, or all commodities, but these are pretty rough charts, anyway.

ghn7acf,War2kali,5,"
I think I'm speaking for almost all of us when I say 2020 was the best of times and the worst of times. Most of it was shit, but our beloved bitcoin has turned around at the end like the unstoppable juggernaut that we know it to be. I see amazingly little weakness in the recent moves. Dips get bought up within hours. The ""dips"" are tiny compared to last run so far. I've never seen such relentless buying pressure. The 1d chart is something to behold. It's glorious and I see this powering into the 30s shortly. Not sure where it will end up in this cycle, but this bull run is not even half done. 
 
Just a few years ago, we couldn't dream of the news stories and progress that we've seen lately. Paypal making it easy to buy and pay for stuff with it? Public companies buying mass amounts? Not just bold software companies run by crazy visionaries (I salute you, Mr. Saylor), but stodgy insurance companies buying it, too? Old hedge funders buying it? Chatter about 1% allocations for everyone? Holy shit have we come far. 2021 looks amazing.

Peering into a murky crystal ball, the long term picture is very interesting. First of all, I think most people would agree that it's not in the interest of the US government to allow a competitor to the US dollar as the safest currency in the world. The US enjoys ridiculously low interest rates on its debt, among many other benefits, thanks to this, and when it changes there will be massive economic repercussions for the world, mostly negative for the US and positive for the new entrants. I expect a lot of people in the US govt to eventually realize that crypto is an enemy. However, right now it's not close to that point so it has been mostly ignored. 

While it's being ignored, bitcoin gathers strength. When Mnuchin proposed the new regulations recently, think about the forces arrayed opposite him. The ""cryptosphere"" would of course include all holders, the ever-growing number of companies in the sector, etc. These forces are growing exponenentially along with the bitcoin price. There may come a tipping point where the government realizes the threat and moves aggressively to neutralize it. The question is whether pro-crypto interests will be able to successfully oppose government moves at that point. Bitcoin is brilliantly designed in so many ways, and one of those ways is the under-the-radar steady growth in strength of pro-crypto interests. Here's to hoping that the allure of easy tax revenue and a critical mass of crypto companies/investors will stop the potential effort to snuff it out. A comforting thought is that only forward-thinking people would realize the threat crypto poses to the US dollar and the government is elected by voters who don't think further ahead than the current year. Thus the crazy deficits and debt. 

The best of both worlds is where we all coexist and prosper. The government realizes its stupidity and both raises taxes in some ways that don't hurt growth (I am a capitalist - does capitalism need billionaires to function as an economic system? no, it does not), cuts expenses (defense budget is a no-brainer), allows moderate inflation to defray the debt over time (the Fed recently very clearly warned everyone to expect higher inflation over the upcoming years), and stops the downward spiral it's currently on. It can use the crypto tax revenue to help other structural reforms (eg marijuana legalization will both increase tax revenues and decrease law enforcement/prison expenses and currently is steadily spreading around the US) and everyone lives happily ever after.",2021-01-01 06:32:31

* NW up to $656,584 from $538,713 (excluding pensions).
* Maxed out 401ks and Roth IRAs. 
* Upped my taxable investments to match raises.
* Refi'd mortgage to 3.125%.
* $200 per paycheck to daughters 529
* Completed the most grueling year of grad school ever while maintaining my savings rate.
* Survived COVID parenting, school, and work.
* Used the leftover ""beer and restaurant money"" to buy bitcoin for shits'n giggles.

**2021 Projections**

* No NW goals; just keeping the savings on auto.
* No more school payments! Invest the difference. 
* Refi again for rate in the 2's.
* Start post school side gig and put 100% of money earned into savings account for real estate.
* Keep contributions to 401k and 529. Income might exceed Roth limits this year so will have to look more seriously into the backdoor option.

2020 was a mixed bag. Finances did really well. I got COVID from work in September and as a result got super behind with grad work and it absolutely destroyed my strength and conditioning goals. I did manage to rehab and old running injury and learn to enjoy running again. I was kind of a deadbeat dad due to so much work but I got to manage the bed time routine and read books to her every night so I'll take that as a win in this insanely busy year.

ghrygd3,Green_Wrongdoer5613,20,"Just blogging along a bit... this is another important tweet from Jesse Powell a couple of hours ago (CEO of Kraken): [https://twitter.com/Nacho\_Bitcoin/status/1345109089450405888](https://twitter.com/Nacho_Bitcoin/status/1345109089450405888)

*Questioner: Will Kraken be following suit?*

*Jesse's response: in the tweet what would be the rationale?*

*Questioner: Not sure, Jesse. I was just wondering if there was some regulatory pressure being brought to bear that you guys were aware of.*

*Jesse's response: Haven’t heard of anything on the regulatory side. Presumably, it’s something specific to their business.*

This is also probably relevant: Bittrex had relatively relaxed KYC procedures for the first few years of its life and has been in battle with US regulators over it: [https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/26592/bittrex-and-bitfinex-appear-to-step-up-kyc-controls-in-wake-of-regulatory-entanglements](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/26592/bittrex-and-bitfinex-appear-to-step-up-kyc-controls-in-wake-of-regulatory-entanglements)

This explains Erik Voorhees' tweet (CEO of Shapeshift, which removed support for privacy coins in November) from a couple of hours ago as well, in which he says: *Jake... you might not realize why they are actually being removed.  Some day I hope to be able to discuss it*. [https://twitter.com/ErikVoorhees/status/1345100565735378947](https://twitter.com/ErikVoorhees/status/1345100565735378947) 

The reason Shapeshift removed support for privacy coins a couple of months ago is specifically because the regulators had accused Shapeshift of being involved in money laundering.

Kraken, OTOH, has had extremely strong KYC from very early on-- if you search early reddit posts about Kraken, folks were very unhappy about how strict Kraken's verification procedures were; from 3 years ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5lsjml/beware\_use\_kraken\_hold\_and\_enforced\_amlkyc\_even/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5lsjml/beware_use_kraken_hold_and_enforced_amlkyc_even/)

FWIW, I think that what we are now likely to see is a strong bifurcation on XMR where there will be maybe three classes of exchanges that will support xmr:  
(1) High-end exchanges US with strong KYC procedures (Kraken, Gemini/ZCash) (Note: I hold no zcash, but am mentioning it because I think xmr/zcash/dash are grouped together in the minds of regulators)  
(2) Non-US exchanges  
(3) (Maybe) new classes of decentralized exchanges that are enabled by atomic swaps

Anyways, putting it all together: the story that is emerging is that this is part of a settlement to a lawsuit or something similar. Overall, I think that folks should think about this bittrex event more like [shapeshift.io](https://shapeshift.io) than like Kraken, Binance, or OKex.

litecoin is a pointless obsolete coin these days and basically just copies bitcoins code with some unique and pointless features:

1) 4 x more coins so less scarce than BTC (negative quality)

2) ""Silver to Bitcoins Gold"" marketing lie Charlie started because silver is used due to impracticality of dividing gold for small purchases and this has never been a limitation of Bitcoin like physical gold has. Bitcoin is extremely divisible , even down to 1/1000 of a sat

3) SCRYPT algo instead of SHA256 was supposed to be ASIC proof and this turned out not to be true . All ltc mining is done with ASICS these days and We now know that GPU mining is not even a desirable trait that LTC originally promoted as being unique regardless

4) Faster block reward with confirmations around 2.5 min instead of 10 min . This is pointless because it leads to greater problems with using the blockchain in space and the Poisson process still means that it might take 30+ minutes to find a block at times in LTC. What people need is instant confirmations regardless which is why Bitcoin created lightning wallets

5) low fees , Bitcoin has low fees of sub penny to 0 within scalable payment channels making LTC pointless. Most alts have low fees onchain because no one uses them and because they aren't worth much so you can't assume a popular blockchain will remain low fees onchain and should assume the opposite which is why you need to scale in layers. Bitcoin has lower fees in a lightning wallet than LTC onchain",2021-01-02 08:51:11
ghrermt,deedledoodle1,9,"Long time lurker. Thought some of you might enjoy my crypto story.

Two years ago I was bored around the holidays and decided to invest in what was considered to be one of the major crypto coins of the time, XRP. I did some due diligence on protecting those assets and decided to buy a ledger crypto wallet to store the currency. 

The Ledger arrived in nice packaging and included some lengthy setup instructions that felt like a mini puzzle. Even though it was just a glorified USB drive, having a physical device to accompany the digital investment somehow solidified this feeling that I was investing in a cutting edge technology. And yet, despite these feelings, after getting the device actually setup I encountered numerous errors trying to transfer the assets from the coin marketplace to the Ledger device. Considering my rather nominal investment of $100 I decided to just leave the currency in my marketplace profile. 

Fast forward to September of this year, I started to receive text messages from random numbers stating “1.2352 Bitcoin was transferred from your Ledger wallet to Russia. Click this link to reset your Ledger password.” I honestly didn’t think much of this at the time because I was also receiving multiple text messages each day telling me to register to vote. And, because I was never actually able to transfer any assets to my Ledger it was easy to ignore the phishing attempts.

In early December, my SO asked about the value of my crypto investment. Given Bitcoin’s bull run at the time, I was actually excited to check the market and, sure enough, my $100 investment was valued around $200.  We discussed whether I should just cash out or let it sit. I decided to let it sit with the hopes of seeing the value continue to grow. My SO thought it would be better for me to cash out and spend it on a hobby item. 

Then, things started to unravel. Later in December I received an email from Ledger stating my personal information had been compromised in the consumer database hack. I was incredibly frustrated, especially because I never even had a chance to successfully use the stupid device. I checked the XRP price once again and with my investment sitting at around $170 I decided to stick with my plan of letting it grow. 

Well, then I received a separate email from the coin marketplace stating that XRP trading would be halted due to SEC action against XRP. I checked the value of my $100 investment and the $70 profit had turned into a $30 loss. 

So here I am sharing my story with you all. My two year, $100 foray into cryptocurrency left me with a funky USB drive I could never get to work, my personal information being stolen, and a 30% loss on my investment. I think I’ll just stick with stocks and bonds from here on out.

**TL;DR Tried to make money off the crypto boom. Got my personal information stolen instead.**",2021-01-02 06:20:06

Lol, you kidding? You couldn't buy that kind of endorsement, its a real-world affirmation of Monero's God-Tier transactional privacy.

&gt;Anyone else just feel like it's going to make it super easy to paint Monero as a bad coin, used by criminals and the like, people are gullible :(

Once atomic swaps are operational, it won't matter. If they ban it, who cares, acquiring Monero will still be as easy as buying Bitcoin on Coinbase. If anything, banning it would ironically be another huge endorsement and a tacit admission by a frustrated government that Monero works really well, which would in effect also be a giant Batsignal to the global black money underworld to start pumping their unbankable billions into XMR, it'd be a no-brainer.",2021-01-02 05:06:42

Bitcoin is not really investing though, it is speculating/gambling.

Sure it went up and in hindsight it was the right idea, but most investments are smart in hindsight.

Did Bitcoin go up because it can do more transactions per second? Because someone invented a new use case? Because Amazon/Starbucks/Disney started accepting it at all locations?

Not really...It went up because it went up.

ghrnnrr,Perringer,7,"&gt;I’m currently using Robinhood

I do hope we've caught you before you've put your entire $50k into Robinhood. You should do some more research into bitcoin and how to hold it before you put more money into it. It's not just about its price rising, as wonderful as that seems.

On Robinhood - you don't own Bitcoin: you own Robinhood's promise of Bitcoin's price. The only thing you can do with your Bitcoin there is to sell them, and you may not want to do that when it gets valuable enough - there will be other things you can do with your bitcoin. 

Also, if your account on Robinhood is hacked, or they're hacked, or they become insolvent, or they decide they no longer want you as a customer for some obscure violation of their TOS, you lose everything.

If you use a reputable exchange (Pro.coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, etc.), then you are free to take your Bitcoin into your personal possession using a hardware wallet, once your fiat deposit clears. This is ""being your own bank"", and there are some things you need to know about how to keep it safe doing that, as well. If you do storage properly, no one, ever, can take your bitcoin away from you.  This keeps your bitcoin safe if your exchange or account falls prey to any of the things I just described for Robinhood.

As bitcoin becomes more valuable, you will be able to use bitcoin to earn interest, or as collateral against loans. You can already do this, but more and more secure and reputable companies will begin doing this as bitcoin's price rises.  This will give you financial power and sovereignty that few will be able to achieve without bitcoin in the future.",2021-01-02 07:38:12

ghum4it,Eodmg,13,"I think something we'll have to accept is that the narrative this cycle is gonna be dominated by ""digital gold"". As much as we like to tout technology and as much as bitcoin likes to tout their strong libertarian bent, the vast majority of us are in it as a get rich quick scheme. This is evidenced by how much the bitcoin/ethereum market cap crashes in percentage terms each cycle. Believing in something =/= investing it it. It's easy to say that the reason why ethereum outperformed bitcoin last cycle was because of better technology and fundamentals, but I think a better and simpler explanation was that the ICO's represented an even bigger get rich quick scheme than bitcoin at the time. This is why the eth/bitcoin ratio peaked in the middle of june 2017 and not jan 2018 - because bitcoin and eth are legitimately decoupled. Bitcoin will drag eth up on days like this, but if you want to see ratio gains, there has to be a simple, easy to explain reason why eth will make you rich. We can see this in the example of yield farming in august vs the more developed defi now. We have way more value locked now than then, but eth2 staking and defi protocols are way less sexy than yield farming back in august. I think people sitting around and complaining about ratio gains are misguided. Eth's technology potential is already priced in to some extent. Every day eth doesn't produce a new SEXY protocol, we should expect to see ratio decay. The way I see it, eth outperforms btc this cycle if and only if it comes out with another, easily pitchable, hypeable protocol. If you're betting on eth, that's what you're betting on. If you're not willing to bet on that this cycle, then you should probably just sell your eth holdings and buy btc.

Quick summary: 

    Age	Net worth (USD)	
    22	  -15,000       graduation debt
    25	  100,000	worked at a successful startup
    30	  720,000	dot com boom
    35	   50,000	pursued expensive hobbies, and bad investments

    50	3,000,000	bitcoin
    51	1,500,000	(estimated) - divorce settlement

Major contributing factors:   
Insight into technology. I made two small fortunes, first was identifying and working at a successful startup out of college in the 90s. The second was identifying the potential of bitcoin around 2013.   
I have 401k and traditional investments, but by far the dot com boom and bitcoin outweighed the gains of the 401k portfolio. I was able to exit both the dot com boom and the 2017 bitcoin boom before the following crashes, and bought back in later. I'm not really a holder as a market melts down, but in hindsight just holding would have worked too.  

Major surprises:   
Success in tech does not mean success in other fields or life generally.   
In hindsight, I wish I invested even more in tech.   
Divorce is expensive, but worth it! (in my case)

My advice if you are in your 20s: Set up your career in a field that will have growth for the foreseeable future (30+ years). Renewable energy, biotech, crypto/DeFi. Believe in and build a better future and invest in it. Get an insiders view of your industry which will help you recognize opportunities.

ghzk5r4,SenatusSPQR,19,"&gt; People who love NANO, how can you still love it when it hasn’t moved much in price since it crashed in 2017. What kept you interested?

First of all, I agree that the price performance has been surprisingly lacking for the past 2 years or so. I'm not mad or annoyed about it, but definitely surprised.

The reason I love it so much is that I came into the crypto space to have a digital decentralised currency. To me personally it wasn't even about the massive gains. It became clear to me at some point that Bitcoin wasn't what I thought it was, and I came across Nano and was just blown away. Ever since, I've been looking for something that's *better* than Nano as a decentralised currency and haven't been able to find it. 

I think that if there's any cryptocurrency that has a shot at actual adoption, at being used as an actual currency by a large group of people, it's Nano. It's the fastest cryptocurrency, it's feeless, decentralised, scales using whatever resources available, has decentralisation incentivised in the protocol, and it's very energy efficient. It doesn't have privacy on the first layer, but aside from that it's pretty close to perfection in terms of being a currency, and this alone makes it a top pick for me already (and is what got me into it).

However, what I noticed when I actually started looking into it more was the community. As you're noticing now on Reddit, there is a rather large and vocal community around it. People can see this as shilling, sure, but there are just a lot of enthusiasts following from how good the tech is. And this community is pretty cool, the subreddit is very active and open for discussion, it's a generally generous community (tipping Nano on the make a millionaire threads, Nano Tip bot, and most recently [WeNano app](https://wenano.net/)). It's the same on Twitter - huge community there, always engaging in good spirits. It just feels like the genuine crypto mindset and community spirit.

Then to top that off, there's a ton of development happening on Nano itself, but also by developers building stuff on Nano. I just posted this somewhere else as well so I'll just paste: there's [Unreal Engine Nano](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/jktalj/a_3d_crypto_transaction_visualizer_with_vr_and/), [Nendly](https://nendly.com/) (Reddit but with Nano), [RoboCash app granted patent](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/j7dwub/nano_based_patent_granted_to_robocash_fyncom/), the Nalli SMS wallet with which you can send anyone with a phone number some Nano, [CoinEmbed](https://twitter.com/kilrizzy/status/1316140323681296386) under development, Nano on Guarda Wallet, [PlayNano](https://playnano.online/) allows buying games, giftcards, mobile top-ups, and gambling, [many excellent NanoBuildoff projects](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/him6e6/monthly_nano_news_june_2020/), the ability to [create tokens on Nano](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/kmxtjt/you_can_now_create_tokens_on_nano_thanks_to/), and on and on and on.

I've always thought of it this way. In *every* sense Nano is a top 10 cryptocurrency, except for the price. If the price were to go to $40 today, it wouldn't be a huge bubble, it would just make sense if you compare it to other projects up there. So I've had no reason to become less optimistic and less interested in Nano, since everything has kept improving except for the price. I believe the price will be catching up to the true value soon :)",2021-01-04 04:59:16

I would like to give a commendation to u/Antranik especially. It is refreshing to see someone post their trades **before** they happen, and from what I notice he has been catching many winning trades going in both directions this entire runup. To me you are the mvp, my dude.

I haven't seen the Jack Dorsey letter to FinCEN regarding the supposed regulations coming up posted here yet. I think it is mandatory reading if you have been in this for a while and now are making solid gains. Its pretty damn informative on what might be coming and I hope won't. Posted below.

[https://squareup.com/us/en/press/fincen-letter](https://squareup.com/us/en/press/fincen-letter)

I speculate Jack Dorsey is the future Elon lite in like 5 years.

I also think what we need now is a fundamental use case for bitcoin that will get people involved.

I remember in early 2017 the ethereum sub had the ability to tip comments in eth which I quite enjoyed and engaged me to post higher quality content. People actually tipped me and I was even able to it to my wallet and I still have that tiny fraction locked away since then which is maybe worth 100 bucks now. After it went away I didn't really post anymore.

If we had something like that here I would have totally tipped u/imissusenet about his post last night stating he sets his dip catches at 9%, 18%, 27%, 36%. If you message me your btc addess i'll send you some still. 

So far I have missed every dip since crossing 20k.

Some open ended questions with no right answer that I would just like to hear your judgement of it:

1) I am wondering why some organizations like coinbase and cashapp have the ability to withdraw your coins but other companies like paypal and robinhood don't. Is it some sort of regulations issue or are they just not as competent? 

2) Is the withdrawal of coins difficult to program?

3) As one of the biggest proponents of crypto and the creator of one of the biggest social media companies in the world, why doesn't Jack Dorsey implement a tipping system on Twitter utilizing Bitcoin? Would this be extremely difficult to do? Or again is it a regulations issue? Or does he simply think it would not be a very enjoyable/useful feature to tip users posts in bitcoin?

gi8gkje,Nythoren,45,"Apologies in advance for the novel.  The TL;DR is that Tesla is a speculation stock that has gotten way out of hand.  

It's based on total speculation and an assumption that Tesla will be ""huge"".  They think it's the next Apple, with years and years of steady stock growth to ensure a profitable investment.  It's not based on fundamentals at all though.  There is a lot of crowing about how Tesla is now profitable.  Sure... but compare Tesla sales and revenue to Ford.  Tesla's market cap, today, is a little over 20x Ford's market cap, yet Ford has significantly higher sales and revenue.  And if/when states start to crack down on the online car sales (which allows Tesla to avoid a lot of the costs that other manufactures are forced to incur), there is no telling just how hard it will hurt sales and profits.  Tesla also doesn't provide dividends, making it one of the only auto manufacturers to provide none of its cash from sales back to its investors.  

Oh but Tesla's price is forward looking!  We're getting in early so we can get dem stonks before they rocket on those future sales!  OK, sure, I get that thinking...but again, Tesla is trading roughly 180x its projected 2021 earnings.  A 180 P/E is just crazy.  The rest of the auto industry averages around a 15x P/E, even with companies expected to dominate the industry for years to come.  Which means the current price has a 1200%+ increase in earnings built in to it beyond the already rosy 2021 earnings increase (and it's getting worse every day as the stock keeps rising).  Given that Tesla earnings are raising by \~15% annually, we're talking decades before its earnings catch up to today's price.  

Tesla is a lot like Bitcoin, honestly.  Its price is more of a meme-economy, almost to the level of being a Ponzi-scheme.  Folks believe it will be worth it, so they keep piling money in to it, which keeps inflating the price.  We saw a similar run on internet stocks in the late 90's, with money pouring in to internet stocks based on speculation instead of any hard data.  In 2001, that bubble burst.  Then we had the real estate bubble, with people throwing their life savings in to mortgage securities and bank stocks.  That bubble burst, hard, in 2008.  The trick with Tesla will be to figure out when the right time is to bail, because when it finally starts to be priced on fundamentals instead of pure enthusiasm, it's going to crater.  

Look what happened to poor Hertz; the internet decided it was a darling and propped the stock up with nothing but speculation.  When they went pink-sheet, over $4 billion in investments disappeared.  

I have no doubt that Tesla is going to be a successful company and make all kinds of money.  But that doesn't mean its stock price will ever be justified.",2021-01-06 07:37:36

Land can be taken away, the value of bank accounts and savings can be taken away, possessions can be taken away. Some by stealth inflation or monetary collapse, some by outright confiscation. 

There is a reason physical gold and silver became money for literally thousands of years, it was easy to possess and hide in a manner that could not be taken away. Maybe your land was taken, but a valuable amount of gold could be carried on your person or located at a secret location. Governments couldn't take that (at least easily).

Bitcoin is the same, it can't be taken away from you and its value can't be stolen through inflation. 

People ""don't get it"" because they assume a static rules based system which America implemented for a couple hundred years. But that is obviously breaking down and everything, and I mean everything will be taken from the middle class over the next 10-20 years. This is obvious.

gie5amm,NystromWrites,135,"&gt;**DISGUISES &amp; DESTRUCTION**

""You're overthinking it. You probably just took a nap and...felt disoriented afterwards. Happens all the time."" The Doctor laughed softly, then walked out of the office.

Why was no one taking this seriously?

I took the bus home- I didn't trust myself to drive anymore- and grumbled the whole way home. I was *sure* something wasn't right, but what was it?

In a flash of inspiration, I knew what to do. I would record myself sleeping tonight- and put some kind of GPS tracker in my phone, so I would know where I'd gone! I had no wife or roommates to watch out for me, so this would have to do.

I made the necessary preparations and went to bed. After a long, fitful, anxious night, I finally succumbed to sleep's embrace.

I woke up- I was *so* sore, like I'd been working out for hours. I had a few bruises, too. One on my thigh, one on my left bicep, and it felt like I had a big one on my back.

I sat up- despite the soreness in my abs- and checked my computer recording.

Wait- it was April *seventh?!* I had lost three whole days!

I skipped to the beginning of the recording, watching through it at triple speed- searching for the moment I got up-

As I woke on the recording, I immediately took my phone out of my pants pocket and threw it on the bed, then left the room. *Damn it!* I groaned. This didn't tell me anything.

What else could I do? Embed the GPS in my damn arm?!

Wait...yes, yes I could. I had *just* enough know-how to get that done, in fact.

I picked up everything I needed- rubbing alcohol, the goods from the electronics store- twelve hours, three hundred dollars, and one sore arm later, and I was implanted with a GPS device with enough juice in the battery to last at least a week. Perfect.

I went to sleep one more time- but something was different. I felt more awake. I felt *ready*.

At about four A.M., there was a knock on my door. I sat up and tossed my phone on my bed- I was lucid this time. I was *pretending* I wasn't- unless I was always lucid for this? I had no way of knowing.

I answered the knock. A tall, extremely fit man stood on the other side- muscles bulged under a fitted white V-neck, which stood out in stark contrast to his dark skin. ""Let's go, Janus.""

""Yeah."" I said, as though it was a natural thing to do.

It was like I had two different halves to my brain- one was a freelance graphic designer, and was *very* alarmed by what was going on.  The other was confident, strong- and was fully aware of my day-by-day persona.

""So- hey, what's going on?"" I asked. 

""Oh, you've brought along the Civilian tonight?"" My partner asked. How did I know he was my partner?

""Seems he's tagging along."" The words came out of my mouth- but I didn't choose to speak them.

""I am so confused.""

""Don't worry about it."" I replied to myself- and then I fell asleep.


I woke up once more, covered in bruises, and sore. It had been two days.


""What the hell?!"" I roared at myself in the mirror. I went to my computer and looked up 'private investigator'. I paid using Bitcoin- and I waited.


Seven days later, I woke up again. There was a note attached to my computer. 

'Some guy paid me to follow you, Noctus, but I won't expose your real identity to the public. Keep doing what you do! - A Private Investigator.'

Notcus. As in- the superhero Noctus? The superhero who took out the entire White Knuckle clan, and their leader, Pyropyre?! That...that couldn't be me!

""It's not."" I answered myself, in Noctus's deeper, more self-assured voice. ""I might be you, but *you* are not me. You need to stop interfering, this is getting out of hand.""

""Whatever *you* are, this is my body, too! I want a say in this!""

Noctus chuckled. ""Nah. This is for the best. Now go to sleep.""

And so I slept.

I woke up again- I had no idea how long it had been. I felt like I had a massive headache- and it was so dark, aside from some fire light...was that a camp fire?

""You still with us, Noctus?!"" It was the same man from the other night. He had a cut on his forehead- it was bleeding, badly.

""No!"" I shouted.

""Ah, hell! Look, Civ- just run! You're no good to me, and we need to get Pyro *down!* Here he comes- get a move on!""

I laid eyes on Pyropyre- one of the most infamous villains of our age- and saw something that was so obvious, it was practically laughable. His puffy clothing was hiding a mech-suit.

""You do know that his fire is just coming from his suit, right?"" I asked my partner as I stood.

""W-what? How can you tell? Can you shut it off?""

""Y-yeah. Just...distract him. Let me get close.""

""You've got spunk after all!"" He shouted, then began taunting Pyro, running around him in circles.

I sprinted forward, heart pounding, and tackled Pyrotech to the ground. ""He can't fire at this angle, his fuel won't reach the uptake!"" I shouted to my partner.

""What?!"" Roared Pyrotech. ""I already killed you!""

""Nah, you just knocked him out- and there's two halves to this coin."" Where this smugness was coming from, I didn't know. I began to rip and tear at the mech suit until, finally, I found the part I needed most- the fuel canister. ""All done!""

""That was *crazy*, Noctus!""

""I'm not Noctus."" I objected as my partner slapped Pyro in shackles. 

""Right, right. Well-look, this guy is small time, but if we ever get to meet again, I'll give you a better nickname than Civ, right?"" 

""Sure thing."" I could feel as Noctus was beginning to wake up. ""And, hey, could you get Noctus to start leaving me notes, at least? Like- how many times do I need to run out of milk and toilet paper before he realizes he's being an ass?""

My partner laughed. ""I'll pass on the message.""

I fell asleep once again- and upon waking, I found another note on my shirt.

'You were kept asleep for a reason. You're too dangerous to be allowed free reign. Noctus is but a shade of your true potential. If you care for humanity, go back to sleep for good, disguised one.'

gid9ju9,temp_plus,60,"I focused on game theory when I studied economics in college. Bitcoin wins against every currency, asset, altcoin, and precious metal in the long run. Here is some game theory thinking for anyone interested:

It took 6,000 years to make an infinitely scarce asset where supply is permanently fixed as demand increases. This is unprecedented as anything that becomes a store of value has a game theory incentive from suppliers to enter the market and produce more of, diluting its value in the long run. Demand for Bitcoin is coming from bonds, stocks, real estate, gold, and currency seeking a store-of-value safe haven as the liquidity loops propping up these markets begin to collapse due to hyperinflation.

Once Bitcoin exists, it is impossible to recreate another infinitely scarce asset to kill Bitcoin. The reason being, c*reating an infinitely scarce asset to kill the first infinitely scarce asset is Catch-22*. By minting more of a different asset to achieve the narrative that it is more scarce than the first asset that cannot be minted more of, your asset is already inferior to the first asset. The reason being, by minting an infinitely scarce asset, you are creating more of stuff even if the supply is capped at a fixed amount.

It is basically the inverse of a central bank with the same cancerous issue. Central banks are stuck with one currency but they can mint as much of it as possible - Blockchain engineers are stuck with a single supply cap but can mint as many new currencies as possible. Same problem, different flavor. This is why Bitcoin is so unusual from a game theory perspective, once the protocol exists as an infinitely scarce asset, it eats every other asset (including other infinitely scarce protocols) that behaves as a store of value in the long run. Everything that tries to compete with Bitcoin will lose since there is no ""second"" store-of-value investment that comes after Bitcoin.",2021-01-07 09:37:19

I know conspiracy theories give comfort as it provides a reason for why the reality you think should exist doesn't actually, but the truth is really that the people invested in other cryptos don't see nano as a threat.

However...and I say this more for everyone else, that's $240,000, minus taxes. You can (possibly) take the track of investing that amount relatively safely and conservatively and let the growth from the investment pay their house off gradually. You *always* would have the option to lump sum it in if you wanted to, but this way you basically just take over their payment for them while you get to keep all of your money. Once the house is paid off, that money keeps growing for you. And you can double 200 grand surprisingly quickly just putting it into VTSAX or something like that.

We have a lot of people here who are going to get quite wealthy, without advanced financial education (and many don't even have basic financial education). I want everyone to think very hard about how you can avoid actually spending your nest egg. Learn how wealthy people handle money...because many of us will *be* them either soon or relatively soon. You don't get wealthy by spending your own money, at least the principle.

gilbnuo,NotMyFriends,50,"I was looking through old Daily Discussion threads from the last bull market when we were going from $1k-$3k to see what the mood was like then. Here are some quotes from old threads:

**Comment 1:**

&gt; I'm selling my btc and it is hard as f**k!
&gt; 
&gt; Scaling out, last one will be sold at $3,300 USD
&gt; 
&gt; This is just a trading decision, risk v reward.
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody else doing the same?

**Comment 2:**

&gt;3 years ago I set a goal for myself to reach a net worth of 500k. I said to myself, when this happens, I will make big changes in my life, I will take the next step in my life, etc. I had all these vague ideas of what that meant.

&gt;I never knew it would happen so quickly. Yesterday, I woke up and my net worth was 500,265 thanks to bitcoin. Here I am, suddenly I have to make big decisions about my life and question who I am. It happened so suddenly. I pondered all day yesterday about this, what am I to do next?

&gt;Finally, I comforted myself: I will set my new goal to 600k and keep living as I am now so that I don't have to worry about it for at least a few months.

&gt; Today I woke up and my net worth was 650k. Fuck.

*Note: Based on today's price, if this person held eveything, their BTC portfolio would be ~$10M.*

**Comment 3:**

&gt; This is insane. Two weeks ago we were consolidating around $1400 and I was thinking we'd reached the top and it was time for a healthy correction.

&gt; Yet here we are, a full $1000 higher.

**Comment 4:**

&gt;i have my phone set to alert me every time there is an all time high. it was a really bad idea to do that. it kept vibrating and making an alarm sound all damn day.

**Comment 5:**

&gt;When I was first buying-in to BTC, I had an exit strategy planned ahead. Basically, selling 10% when we reached certain price points. I did that at $1200, which felt great because my average buy-in price was in the low $400s, so I tripled my money and still had 90% of my holdings riding.

&gt;Well, my next price point was something like $2300. And we've just blown through that overnight, and are knocking on $2400. So now I'm sitting here, looking at this enormously steep curve, wondering if I should even stick with my plan.

ginibeu,Natille,50,"Apart from Bitcoin, there are very few pure cryptocurrencies that simply want to serve as a means of payment. Most of the other cryptocurrencies instead see themselves as smart contracts platforms (Ethereum, EOS, Cardano, Tron …), represent a kind of share of a company (XRP, Binance Coin, Crypto.com Chain, Vechain) or pursue other goals (Tether, IOTA, …).

While the usual “pure currency” alternatives to Bitcoin $ BTC are relatively similar to Bitcoin, as they arise from a fork (Litecoin $ LTC, Bitcoin Cash $ BCH, …), a cryptocurrency called Nano has been enjoying great popularity for some time Reddit and Twitter social media. Some users are already trading NANO as the next bitcoin, as it made 265% in the past 7 days!

What is NANO?

Nano is a lightweight cryptocurrency that is designed to facilitate secure, practically instant payments, without fees, and addresses some of the major limitations of both legacy financial infrastructure and many modern cryptocurrencies.

It is a peer-to-peer platform that uses a unique block-lattice data structure to allow users to easily transfer value to one another without relying on centralized intermediaries.

Development of the project began in 2014 under the name RaiBlocks, and the coin (then termed XRB) launched the following year through a public faucet, which allowed users to claim small amounts of XRB after completing a captcha challenge. Users were allowed to complete as many captchas as they liked to increase their words — effectively trading their time and effort for XRB. RaiBlocks (XRB) was rebranded to Nano (NANO) in January 2018, with the new name chosen to better represent the speed and simplicity the project offers to users.

Nano vs. Bitcoin – the comparison

Technology: While Bitcoin is based on the blockchain technology we are all familiar with, Nano relies on the exotic block-lattice architecture. This causes some drastic changes in the characteristics of the two currencies.

Speed: Compared to Nano, Bitcoin is very slow. While Bitcoin transactions on the blockchain take on average significantly more than 10 minutes (to rule out a double-spend), nano transactions are completed in 0.18 – 1.5 seconds and thus even faster than Ripple. If you want to test the speed yourself, you can measure the speed here.

Similar speeds are only achieved with Bitcoin in the Lightning Network.

Transaction throughput: Bitcoin has to admit defeat here too. While Bitcoin only supports a maximum of 7 transactions per second with the current block size, the transaction throughput of Nano is basically unlimited, similar to IOTA. The transaction throughput is only limited by the hardware used. Bitcoin only delivered these effects on the Lightning Network.

Transaction costs: Due to the block-lattice, there are no transaction fees at Nano. With Bitcoin, there are basically no obligations to pay a transaction fee, but if you want to complete your Bitcoin transfer in a finite time, you can’t get around it for better or worse. Transaction fees of ~ $ 0.70 are currently common. At the peak of 2017, however, $ 20 bitcoin fees were necessary. Here, too, the Lightning Network for Bitcoin offers the only way out of the fee hell.

Inflation: Bitcoin is limited to a maximum of 21 million units. However, until this limit is reached in 2140, the number of Bitcoins will continue to increase. Should inflation flatten too much, Bitcoin could have problems ensuring network security. Nano, on the other hand, is limited to 133 million units. In contrast to Bitcoin, however, Nano is already completely distributed and there is no further inflation. Due to the Lattice block, this does not pose any problems for Nano, as no miners are required for network security.",2021-01-09 22:17:08
gil4it7,GreyMatter22,50,"Some advice here, DO NOT QUIT YOUR DAY JOB.

I absolutely love the capital markets, have invested in all the momentum speculative investments as full disclosure.

Now I went to school for finance; therefore, all my classmates were WSB finances bros, and all my co-workers have also been WSB finance bros, lol.

While it is fun, and we discuss crazy market movements and strategies for fun, none of us would ever quit our day jobs.

Back in 2017 when /r/weedstocks were hitting 100% gains every other week, there were actually people who made a bank and quit their day jobs to trade this forever, same for /r/bitcoin back in early '18.

But all this does not last forever, sooner or later, speculative investments will come crashing down hard, like very very hard, and at the point, you better have a day job or you are screwed.

gild554,_SwanRonson__,49,"First of all, congratulations. Whatever people say it’s the results that matter and you got them. 

Let me tell you something. 25% is an amazing return. Let’s assume it was 100% due to the actions you took in some way. You should not change a thing if you agree with that assumption. More work/research/whatever does not equal better returns, and your returns are already stellar. I’d venture to say that the person with the highest return in the last decade is some guy who literally forgot he owned a bunch of bitcoin. Would he have made that return if he pored over crypto white papers all day? No, he would have done something dumb at some point. 

Basically what I’m saying is if it ain’t broke don’t fix it. Assuming you’re actually doing something right, keep doing that thing. Maybe your work acts as just enough of a filter that only really good ideas find their way to your hour a day of leisurely reading about investing, who knows. 

Putting on my big boy hat, you got real lucky, congrats. Take the life-changing gains out if you made them, let the rest ride, and for God’s sake if you decide you’re god’s gift to investing don’t bet the (whole) house on what you think is the next bitcoin.",2021-01-09 07:43:49

As we all know, many people got attracted to BTC in 2020 because of its hardened monetary policy. 21M Bitcoin. Halvings every 4 years, etc. etc.

But in 2021 and 2022, ETH will get two upgrades that will give it a monetary policy that’s better than BTCs: (1) EIP 1559 and (2) deprivation of the POW rewards.

EIP 1559 is coming likely mid year and is a fee burning mechanism that will burn a portion of the gas fees in each transaction. So you can imagine the effect of this as the utility and value of Ethereum/DeFi/etc. goes up and people want to use it more. 

Getting rid of the POW rewards in favor of the POS rewards will alone result in a issuance rate drop from about 4.5% to 0.5%. This alone is incredible because its an issuance rate less than Bitcoin for about the next 12 years.

Then, when you factor in the fee burning effects, ETH’s issuance can go negative (something BTC can never do). Over the next year or so, we will start to see ETH being talked about as a competing digital SOV to BTC, and I believe its going to gain a significant amount of that market share.

It is however (like you said, more or less) an opportunity for those who are being controlled by their governments via money to opt out. To safely exit the falling elevator of a failing fiat system. 

This is more than a protest, it is real change. It's unfortunate that we can't prevent those organizations who helped to ruin the dollar from buying in now, but that's a consequence of having a stateless, trustless, decentralized freedom system. 

It removes one important state control apparatus from the equation which may lead to less oppression and eventually maybe more justice. It just won't do that on its own though.

99% of altcoins/ICOs are scams and its difficult to evaluate them unless you know the history of these projects and are a programmer yourself so can evaluate their claims

Altcoins will come and go as we have always seen but bitcoin having a first mover advantage means that it is has the most network effect and best chance of surviving longterm 

One of the primary reasons Bitcoin was created was to have a sound monetary policy and digital scarcity , and being a multicoiner undermines all of this

Using wallets and software that supports multiple coins is confusing  and can lead to mistakes where you can lose money and makes the software far more insecure with a wider attack surface and potential for bugs and exploits 

When looking at the long term graphs , most altcoins pump and dump and lose value relative to Bitcoin. 

Getting involved with altcoins forces you to spend a ton of extra time learning complex and obscure projects 

Scammers prefer to target people that use altcoins as we saw with the ICO craze because Bitcoiners tend to have more experience and be more skeptical to evaluate their claims

Being involved in altcoins usually means you don't have long term time preferences and simply want to speculate short term which many people will consider a character flaw because you are more of a gambler

"" According to their research, \[Nick\] Fuentes, a popular right-wing commentator who was suspended from YouTube last winter for violating its policies on hate speech, received the largest chunk of funding on Dec. 8 — about $250,000 in bitcoin. The Daily Stormer and the anti-immigration website VDARE were among the other recipients. 

Yahoo News reached out to the recipients named in this article to confirm whether they had received the funding, what information they had about the donor and what they planned on doing with the funds. None returned a request for comment, although Fuentes [tweeted an obscene gesture](https://twitter.com/NickJFuentes/status/1349626511079432194?s=20), naming several journalists, including this reporter, shortly after the inquiry was sent.

While the Daily Stormer website openly requests cryptocurrency donations, it also includes a disclaimer that says it is “opposed to violence” and that “anyone suggesting or promoting violence in the comments section will be immediately banned.”

While there’s no evidence that Fuentes directly participated in the Capitol riot, something he has so far denied, the financial resources of prominent right-wing actors are of growing interest to law enforcement.

**“I’d be stunned if both nation-state adversaries and terrorist organizations weren’t figuring out how to funnel money to these guys,” one former FBI official who reviewed the data for Yahoo News said. “Many of them use fundraising sites (often in Bitcoin) that are virtually unmonitored and unmonitorable. If they weren’t doing it, they’d be incompetent.”**

Additionally, much like conversations that took place on social media in the weeks leading up to the Capitol riot, the digital currency transactions are happening in plain sight. While cryptocurrency has the reputation of being anonymous and shadowy, that’s actually a common misconception, explained Maddie Kennedy, Chainalysis’s communications director. “With the right tools you can follow the money,” she said. “Cryptocurrency was designed to be transparent.”",2021-01-15 03:54:04

gjc3ozx,flameylamey,259,"Haha, don't worry, you're not alone. Here's my entire (albeit condensed) crypto story:

Bought in to the market in late November 2017, initially 2/3 BTC and 1/3 LTC - with my entire savings that I spent the last 5 years accumulating.

After a few days of watching BTC rise while LTC stagnated, I decided ""Litecoin clearly isn't going anywhere"" and traded my Litecoin for Bitcoin.

Woke up the next morning, Litecoin was up something like 60%. It went approx 5x over the next week and would've become worth more than my BTC holdings.

Ended up buying in to Vertcoin, became persuaded by a bunch of Vertcoin believers. Became convinced that I was holding ""a proven product that has survived the test of time, with good fundamentals"" as I watched almost everything else moon around me. Made a few trades here and there, but only with the intention of increasing my Vertcoin stack. Spent almost the entirety of December 2017 all-in on Vertcoin. Watched several almost-breakouts that amounted to nothing. By the end, from memory it was the *only* coin in the top 100 that wasn't in the green over the course of the month of December.

Decided I'd go all in on XLM and was about to let it ride, but second guessed myself at the last minute and traded it all back for Vertcoin, as I thought it was ""due for a pump"" while XLM had already pumped a bit. XLM went up approximately 4-5x in sat value over the following week or so. Vertcoin... did not.

Saw a lot of hype surrounding TRX. Decided I was sick of watching all this stuff get shilled that was consistently mooning while I missed the boat, so I wasn't going to miss the boat this time. All in on TRX. (Believe it or not, sentiment was actually positive here around TRX at the time).

Rode TRX up about 20% right before the top - awesome, finally some gains! Saw the hype building around Vechain. Decided to go all in on Vechain. Second guessed myself at the last minute, went back to TRX. Vechain went 4x over the following 2 weeks. TRX... did not.

Took out two $20k loans on the way down throughout 2018, put it all in alts with potential.

Bear market ended up being much longer than I thought. In November 2018, I was something like 90%+ down and decided ""what more have I got to lose at this point? Might as well make some risky plays"". Decided to trade all my holdings back to BTC and try a series of longs on Bitmex. Turns out... the bottom was not quite in yet. Got liquidated, multiple times. Lost everything, including my loan money.

Spent the next 2 years making loan repayments equivalent to paying rent on a small apartment.

Bonus story: In March 2019, I had about $5k that I decided to put into BTC. I thought I'd have another go at leveraged trades on Bitmex. I put the $5k into a 7x leveraged long position on, when BTC was trading for $3950. I had this whole plan where I was going to just leave it for up to 6 months and see what happens. If it dropped and I got liquidated, oh well, it means the market probably isn't going to rise any time soon and I'd have time to buy lower. I'd already rationalised it to myself.

What did I do? you guessed it - less than a day later, at the last minute before I went to bed that night, I second guessed myself (again!) and decided to cancel the position. Woke up the next morning to see a massive surge in price, and... it just kept going. It ended up climbing from $3950 to almost $14,000 over the next 3 months. If I'd just left that position, I would've made it on that long alone. I worked it out at the time and if I'd just left it as I intended to, that $5k would've turned into something like $300k over a 2-3 month span, I would've had so much BTC. Can't even imagine what it would be worth now.

Man, it sounds so over-the-top when I type it out like that, haha. I *wish* I was making this shit up.

Where am I now? Well, while I was mostly living paycheck-to-paycheck while paying off my loan, I did get a bit of extra money from being picked for jury duty in March-June 2019. I served on a trial that went for ~10.5 weeks and ended up earning a nice sum of money to buy back into the market. Since that buy-in I'm up approximately 6x and have recovered around 70% of the total money I've put into the market, including everything I lost. Things are looking up!",2021-01-15 21:04:53

***Lack of preparation? Or planning for an insurrection?***

I believe Trump and his new appointees lowered our defenses so that the [coup attempt he would incite](https://youtu.be/nz-zWeqtVo8) would have a chance to succeed.

Pentagon staff [refused requests by the Mayor of D.C. to approve the use of National Guard Troops to help secure the Capitol on January 6th](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-protests-washington-guard-military/2021/01/07/c5299b56-510e-11eb-b2e8-3339e73d9da2_story.html).

Pentagon staff and [Capitol Police leadership](https://www.stripes.com/news/us/capitol-police-were-overrun-left-naked-against-rioters-1.658054) purposely limited the role of the National Guard. There was to be no activation of the National Guard to secure the Capitol as they had done months earlier during the BLM rallies.

[Capitol Police were also unprepared](https://www.businessinsider.com/capitol-police-officer-says-cops-sent-home-ahead-of-march-2021-1?utm_source=reddit.com), they were not fully staffed, they were not advised to bring gas masks, and were forbidden to don riot gear. ([Chief Sund has resigned, however he stated reports that Capitol Police refused the assistance of the National Guard were untrue](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/11/955548910/ex-capitol-police-chief-rebuffs-claims-national-guard-was-never-called-during-ri))

***Failure to respond:***

There was [inaction despite repeated requests](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/11/955548910/ex-capitol-police-chief-rebuffs-claims-national-guard-was-never-called-during-ri) (from the besieged Congress, from Pence, and from the Republican Governor of Maryland) for permission to send the Maryland National Guard into DC [to respond to the rioting as it unfolded](https://youtu.be/83wgYO2D7bU). *Apparently* [Trump watched the riots unfolding and was delighted](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/533403-sasse-says-trump-was-delighted-and-excited-by-reports-of-capitol-riot)*.*

***Martial Law:***

A riot evolving into hostage taking would have provided Trump with the excuse he needed to [impose martial law](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/12/22/martial-law-trump-flynn-history/), an idea that had been repeatedly floated by his adviser, disgraced ex-National Security Director Michael Flynn, whom Trump had just pardoned.

Unfortunately for the Trump conspirators, the rioters were held at bay long enough to stop the taking of hostages, and perhaps the deaths of Congressmen/Congresswomen and Mike Pence. 

One can assume that if Trump would have used the excuse that only he could maintain law and order, and that he would need to remain in charge indefinitely until law and order could be restored.

[Pence ultimately did an end run around Trump](https://news.yahoo.com/maryland-governor-tried-deploy-national-002546744.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAKsKE2PZ7wwKz9bc7ffqEg2AeWcJIFmKdM9KgWugACuS8DqQp5Vwv9kgpYcIDt3IGfyHT7C_W0JGxng6ACBpd2mqSTqP0DoAG5OxbhLqWJxe95ex6Qx57s4KpXF8q38JaEg8SrdnzFhBAGlgBYoLoTj_jtuBtJ7xVylkOi0HRrj) ([Pelosi and other Congressional leaders were also involved in this process](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/06/politics/pence-national-guard/index.html)) in order to provide the authorization needed for the Guard to arrive and secure the Capitol, stopping the insurrection.

**Aftermath:**

*We need a post-Trump 9/11 style commission to investigate this attempted insurrection. If Trump is complicit in planning an insurrection to remain in power he should be tried for treason*

As is, Trump's inaction after inciting the riot should lead to impeachment and removal from office, and any of the collaborators in the defense department who neutered the National Guard, and within the administration, and every rioter that attacked the Capitol Police need to be doxed and charged.

Apparently many rioters were off duty military, veterans or off duty police officers and fire fighters from distant states that [flashed their ID badges as they entered the Capitol](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/07/capitol-hill-riots-doj-456178).

[They all need to be identified](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/capitol-riots-virginia-police-officers-arrested/), arrested, and if they are currently serving in the military face a court martial, and if they are a current police officer or fire fighter terminated from those positions that require public trust to ensure public safety.

Senators and Congresspeople who either incited this riot and/or continued to attempt and stop the certification of the election after the attempted coup are complicit, and should also be removed from office.

This is based on their approval of a small number of Guardsmen to serve as traffic control (two shifts of 90 soldiers, 180 total), Metro assistance (two shifts of 24 soldiers, 48 total), administrative staff, and one small rapid response team of 40 soldiers. These soldiers were activated specifically for traffic control to help Trump rioters enter and exit D.C.

It's now up to an incredible amount, about ten times higher than what was then considered a fantasy of delusional proportions. There was at the time literally a whole copypasta of some bitcoiner's fantasy of waking up and seeing a $5K bitcoin price followed by spending their day doing various activities with bitcoin integrated into the process.

gj9bsqm,GonzoAndJohn,105,"tl;dr at the bottom. So in order to explain what mining is, you need to know the whole premise of what bitcoin is meant to represent. Bitcoin was designed as an implementation of blockchain, which is a buzzword that basically means ""We need a system to keep track of something (typically transactions, sales, purchases, etc.). We have to make sure everyone has a copy of this ledger, and that it's impossible to forge.""

Bitcoin came in as a ""proof of work"" system for verifying transactions. Basically, whenever someone buys or sells Bitcoin that they already own, they start a transaction: a problem is generated, and every computer that is involved with ""mining"" tries to solve it. It takes the form ""I'm thinking of a number that ends in 000000. Generate a random number that, when run through a hashing algorithm, ends in 000000."" The first computer on the network to solve this problem ""verifies"" the transaction. This attaches the transaction to the ledger, and for the ""proof of work"" that was done to verify it, the person who verified it gets some bitcoin.

Because every detail in this ledger has to line up and hashing is difficult, it's very very difficult to forge. If you wanted to change a transaction in the past (e.g. ""a week ago this guy gave me a million bitcoins, not just one""), or add your own (e.g. ""some guy just gave me a hundred dollars, I promise""), it would be nearly impossible to manipulate every transaction after that point to line up, since previous transactions factor into future ones, and if you want to update the ledger, you need to get more than half of the computers on the node to believe you. (Fun fact, if you owned more than half of the processing power that was currently mining any cryptocurrency, you could unilaterally do anything you wanted with all of it since you could just invent your own transactions and get more than half of the group to ""agree"" that it happened that way).

The key part of this is that hashing is difficult, that's the only reason crypto works. Technically speaking, an old pentium could get very lucky and randomly guess the solution to every transaction before anyone else, but graphics cards are very good at solving these types of problems, so miners tend to snatch them up for mining rigs. You can guess on the first try, or on the millionth try, but if you can guess a million times per second, chances are you'll verify a lot more transactions (and therefore get paid a lot more) than someone who can only guess a thousand times per second.

tldr: Mining crypto is the new version of being a notary and signing your name on other people's fancy sales. It's actually just the bank saying ""Guess what number I'm thinking of and I'll pay you for your time"" so you start guessing random numbers correctly so you can get paid a pittance. However, every so often these random numbers become harder to guess. The bank decides ""I've given too much bitcoin out recently just to notaries because everyone brought their random number generators so they could guess faster, so I'll make random guessing harder. Instead of between 1 and 10, now you have to guess between 1 and 1000."" As a result, the faster your computer can guess randomly, the more of a pittance you get paid, so miners buy new GPUs, work them half to death, and try to sell them for what they paid on Craigslist to unsuspecting people with words like ""Gently used"", ""never over 60% power"", but obviously not ""fan was running 24/7 for the last 8 months"" because miners lmao.",2021-01-15 04:13:38

gjdandv,bitusher,78,"I would rather have higher degrees of privacy working on other layers like lightning, or sidechains(liquid CT) or wallets (Wasabi/payjoin) than the base layer because:

1)	The auditability of inflation and the 21 million limit is critical. All complex privacy crypto solutions may have undetectable bugs that lead to very difficult to detect inflation. With Bitcoin everyone can easily audit the chain. With certain privacy coins like monero their inflation resistance relies faith in the future of ECC security which might need to be upgraded in the future thus casting serious doubts on an inflation bug existing undetected.


2)	It is important to give users the option of transparency and audibility onchain, at least for accounts they choose to expose. 


3)	In the future privacy coins will be the first to be banned and liquidity is super critical. There are good reasons why most DNM txs are still using BTC

It is far more likely they outlaw or restrict privacy coins (because they choose to market themselves as a privacy coin onchain instead of just giving users the option of privacy on wallets and other layers) as you can see here

https://archive.is/ZMAbo

&gt;""Secretary of State Pompeo seems to confirm that the cryptocurrencies the federal government is watching most closely are privacy coins. If so, Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC), and others may soon be in some hot water if they are not banned altogether.""

We are already seeing this occur with new regulations in the US where they are proposing to KYC the withdrawal address which would mean that exchanges will be forced to drop support of ""privacy coins""

This is already occurring 

https://bittrexglobal.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018560640


4)	privacy tech like ring signatures, CT, and zk-snarks has huge scalability tradeoffs and much higher resource demands leading to more centralization and greater inefficiencies.

5) cross-input signature aggregation incentivizes more use of coinjoin by making  regular onchain transactions almost as small as regular transactions and lightning is designed to be extremely private from the get go. There is still an option to have transparency and give the allusion to regulators that they can track coins onchain however.

6) Coinjoin with a wallet is private enough, Look at what an employee of leading coinanalytics company says about coinjoin - 

Read this - 
https://removeddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/c4so58/i_am_a_current_or_former_employee_of_chainalysis/

&gt;Initially, the difficulty was standard mixers (still are) but now I would say Wassabi is enemy number one. **There is no way to de-anonymize it, and I don't see how the government can legally take Wassabi down, so it will probably persist.** Put it this way, if everyone used Wassabi, Chainalysis would go out of business.


note , this was anonymous leak so no way to verify comment came from actual former employee.

7)	Here is a presentation on how Taproot with signature aggregation can allow for UTXOs with untraceable swaps and indistinguishable payment channels. Taproot allows privacy txs to share the same anonymity set as regular onchain transactions thus eliminates the concerns with everyone forced to opt into a privacy Bitcoin wallet to have a larger anonymity set.
 
https://youtu.be/TYkIyUaRG0s?t=7592

8)	Privacy is a complex topic that has many nuances. Many privacy coins have lower tx fees(Bitcoin has lower tx fees on other layers) than Bitcoin onchain(mainly because they are hardly used and have low value) . Lower onchain tx fees can lead to the risk of very inexpensive attacks to deanonymize users as well. Bitcoin being designed where onchain fees will grow to cover the cost on security (and as explained privacy)  and inexpensive txs occur on other layers(that are very private like lightning which is multihop and onion routed by default which makes coin analytics practically impossible) is the better balanced solution IMHO.

9) payjoin is a new way to become very private onchain and reduce the UTXO set while doing so , its already in btcpay and bluewallet

Bitcoin being the first crypto as a store of value, limited supply, etc. is critical in every portfolio. In a world of unlimited money printing bitcoin will continue to go up.

Ethereum is the software of the world. Most of all other coins are built on top of Ethereum. As defi/derivates goes mainstream, ethereum will inevitably go up as well - as its the native currency on that network. And many more use cases are being developed on ethereum. 

Bitcoin might be valued at 36k or whatever but look at market cap. Its about 1 third of Amazon market cap (dollars invested in the asset). So relatively cheap compared to Amazon or Apple. Not to say ethereum is insanely cheap compared to them and its not even at all time highs yet.

If bitcoin is being compared to gold as a 10 trillion dollar asset in market cap, bitcoin is far superior as you can do more w it like wrap and use on ethereum.

There will be a limit to how much people will pay for a bitcoin too. The fact that we don't know what that limit is yet, doesn't matter. The limit will be hit.

Well well well… its been over a year since we have heard from our plucky friend Gator. He slipped into the Louisiana Bayou during the bear market with talk of pursuing studies in economics and international finance. He always was one of the smart ones around here. 

I was in my rocking chair on the back porch overlooking the swamp with a fist full of Apple Pie moonshine when what did I see waddling up my way? My ole’ friend Gator. 

“Been awhile pal” I exclaimed as he hoisted his now full-grown reptilian body up to my porch beside me. “How’s your crypto doing?” I asked jokingly. 

He winked and replied, “Right on track old friend. I have traveled far and wide in my studies and have even given a few key note speeches on decentralization and the emergence of digital assets. 

I see now more than ever signs that crypto is here to stay and that the speculation level is falling. ETH and BTC are still my only focus as a conservative gator.

The hedge against inflation, store of value and digital gold has taken a foothold for BTC among the biggest money managers in the world. Not my fav really, but this will underpin and legitimize the entire space. 

ETH has entered 2.0 in a near-flawless launch and continues to pile in staking deposits and a mind-boggling pace. The realization of what ETH will become is growing stronger by the day. 

I don’t mean to cut this visit short, but I am a busy gator and have more messages to spread across the land. I will say however that for this year to come, the stories will be supply shortage for Bitcoin and Layer 2 and DeFi for Ethereum.  

Good day my friend. Until we meet again.”

As gator slid back into the murky waters, I thought to myself; The young plucky gator we once knew has turned into such a fine young gentleman.

Innocent indulgence in showing how Cardano is technically superior to chain-X, leads to the perception you're fudding other (more popular) projects, and you're toxic. People are naturally defensive of their current perspective. So, assuming you're the only, or first ""Cardano expert"" they're  engaging with, the person that's considering the advice you just gave them on Cardano will stop judging Cardano's pro's and con's, and start judging if your position on it is toxic if you appear to be fudding. People stop listening, and defend their current position in their minds when you mention how much better X is than Y. Instead, why not just talk about X.

This psychological  reaction has ruined more than one project. I mean look what happened to Bitcoin Cash, the only currency I can actually transact with now because of it's wide adoption, and low fee's. Their community's perceived toxicity, and zealotry by others in the crypto space  makes it a tough community to enjoy being a part of, regardless of the far superior tech. I mean try saying anything in that sub without getting downvoted. It's no wonder they crashed in relative price and never recovered. Same thing happened to EOS, great tech, but an unintentional toxicity in the community other's found repulsive, so nobody built anything there, they stuck with Ethereum.

A great deal of Ethereum's success may be due to the fact that you never heard anyone (that mattered) in the ETH community fudding Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Maximalist appeared terrified of it. The tech surrounding Ethereum generated enough curiosity to draw in developers and the rest is history.

Superior tech doesn't need to fudd the tech they're supposedly a great improvement over, it has the opposite effect the individuals, and communities that engage in it desire.

gjvo591,Debo37,75,"Hi all, while everyone's having fun (or not) riding the chop lately, I wanted to zoom out a bit and set up some perspective so we can understand what's going on in the long run. It helps to put the current price action in the context of the 4-year halving cycles - as it turns out, we're in a pretty interesting range that might have a lot of future significance for Bitcoin. Hopium follows.


***


Last cycle's absolute bottom was at around **$200 USD** during the second and third weeks of January, 2015. Last cycle's absolute top was at around **$19,000 USD** for essentially four days during the third week of December, 2017.

The bottom-to-top multiple for the 25 to 12.5 BTC halving cycle was therefore around **95x** for someone who hypothetically purchased the absolute low and sold the absolute high.

The current 12.5 to 6.25 BTC halving cycle has likely already put in its absolute bottom at around **$3,200 USD** for about four days during the third week of December, 2018.

If we assume that the bottom-to-top multiple is halved this cycle (in the spirit of halvings, of course), we can use a **47.5x** multiple from our absolute low to estimate an absolute high of **$152,000 USD**. Assuming our top for the 12.5 to 6.25 BTC cycle lands in that range, and assuming a typical 70-80% cycle correction, we'd be looking at an absolute bottom price of between **$30,400 USD** and **$45,600 USD** during the 6.25 to 3.125 BTC halving cycle. Current spot prices are right in the middle of this range, and all the chop you daytrader folks are riding might just be establishing our support level for the next macro cycle. A good, solid test of the $30k support would be extremely healthy for the long term and might help put in a floor for the next cycle crash in late 2022-early 2023. If your time horizon involves cashing out in the 2025 cycle, this could even be considered an excellent entry point.

This of course assumes that BTC prices are purely a function of BTC's supply inelasticity, and neglects all the market dynamics and narratives at play here though. I think there should be significant error bars to either side of the **$152,000 USD** number to reflect that - with a bigger error bar to the upside given the seemingly positive macro environment and a number of strong, favorable narratives, which I have listed below.


***


**Favorable market dynamics/narratives:**

* High inflation (due to interventionist monetary policy in the wake of COVID-19)
* A concurrent bull market in stocks
* Leading-edge institutional investment interest
* DeFi - decentralized finance
* Bitcoin as a ""store of value""

**Unfavorable market dynamics/narratives:**

* Government regulation and saber-rattling
* Solvency questions surrounding Tether, the crypto ecosystem's largest bank
* Blockchain scaling questions
* BTC's massive electricity consumption (framed in context of climate issues)
* Gold as a better ""store of value""

I foresee the gold vs. Bitcoin question arising at some point this cycle and becoming a permanent fixture of the narrative landscape for the long term. At current prices, gold has around a **~$10 trillion USD** market cap, compared to Bitcoin's **~$700 billion USD** market cap. Should Bitcoin rise to **~$54,000 USD**, its market cap will cross the vaunted trillion dollar mark, and I expect the Bitcoin vs. gold comparisons to go mainstream, as Bitcoin would be priced at roughly 10% the value of gold. I expect this to be one of the dominant financial narratives of the 2020s - is Bitcoin or gold a better deflationary asset in an age of inflation? I think the charts will tell us by the end of the decade, but gold is going to be Bitcoin's greatest adversary yet.

I think the goldbugs will laugh off Bitcoin's threat this cycle - BTC will probably peak somewhere between $100k and $250k, and then print its usual 70-80% cycle crash. But I think the 2025 cycle is going to be dominated by the gold comparisons. If the stock-to-flow model is a correct representation of reality, the next halving would make Bitcoin *more* valuable than gold, and the horse race would get very, very intense. If gold doesn't go down in 2025, it's doomed in 2029.


***


**TL;DR:** Halving last cycle's bottom-to-top multiple and multiplying it against this cycle's apparent bottom paints a price target for the 2021 cycle top in the mid-$100ks, with the potential to go higher than that if the macro environment continues to be favorable. Current price action might be setting a price floor for the next halving cycle by solidifying the $30k support, which appears to be a plausible ""bottom price"" for the 2021-2025 cycle.",2021-01-20 07:15:50
gjvowvd,yazmataz_,75,"daily TA for the vefam:

short term: days, 

long term: weeks

VET/BTC

We broke &amp; held the 100D MA. At this point we'll start gathering momentum against bitcoin with a major upward movement with the 9 week MA. 

VET/ETH

Short term: vet is still trying to reverse the 20D MA and the 30D MA on the vet/eth chart. Yesterday we were rejected by the 3 day 9 MA.

Long term: vet/eth still hasn't even touched its 9 week MA.

VET/USDT

The 100H MA is in a major cup &amp; handle. Last time this cup &amp; handle formed the 100H MA went up 98%. 

Overall

We continue to see the last remaining resistance from vet/eth. We were rejected yesterday from the 3D 9 MA which held at .00002435. In order to get a push against eth we need to reverse the 10D, 20D, and 30D MAs. We believe this will come soon as the vet/usdt 100H MA will continue to push the price upward, and vet/btc has already reversed. We should have enough upward movement to reverse these major MAs against ETH. 

In general, we'd say get your popcorn ready. The upward movement of the vet/btc 9 week MA is very telling of whats to come. These last few resistances will break and we will start moving upward against both ETH &amp; BTC in the coming weeks.

We've put out all of our content &amp; charts on our twitter vetJTT if you're a visual person.

In contrast, Ethereum Classic and Bitcoin Cash succeeded in having a long-term market value because they made strong ideological stances that significant amounts of users agreed with.

When those forks happened, some percentage of actual hodlers looked at Ethereum and Ethereum Classic and said ""screw Ethereum they deviated from the plan, Ethereum Classic is the real ethereum."" Likewise, some amount of Bitcoin holders said ""screw Bitcoin they deviated from the plan, Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin.""

But minimum viable issuance has been cemented into Ethereum's social contract for years and years, longer than I can remember. Nobody could plausibly believe that the miner fork is ""the real ethereum"", unless they are paid to believe that (cough miners).

It's laughable that miners want to create a hard fork based on some weak inexplicable ideology, that will somehow have market value even though nobody will buy it. They really want to commit to mining on a valueless chain?

This tantrum that they're throwing is a delaying tactic, plain and simple. I still haven't heard one valid argument against 1559 that wasn't ""but it will reduce miner profitability"" or based on a misunderstanding of what 1559 actually does.

Change my view, the miners are a child who has been sucking on a lollipop all day, then starts crying as soon as the lollipop runs out. Miners are ""endless lollipopers"". They don't understand that lollipops are designed to dissolve over time in your mouth, that's just how lollipops work.

If you're a user/hodler and you have a good argument that the 1559 patch itself would be bad for the health of the ethereum protocol, I want to hear from you. I'm not convinced yet that you exist.

To everyone saying ""oh no, we better hold off now because this is cOnTeNtIoUs"", I ask: contentious among who? It's not contentious among users, it's not contentious among investors, it's not contentious among developers, and it's not contentious among exchanges. Read: failed hard fork.

Ethereum devs need to stick with their current plan, to address any REAL concerns everyone has with 1559, then ship it. This boogeyman wishy-washy shit will not fly in this community.

One last thought, the miners have no loyalty and haven't hesitated to ditch the Ethereum chain when the Ethereum Classic chain is more profitable. Why do we owe any loyalty to them?",2021-01-21 11:38:29

gk5un4b,AntiSky,164,"Yes.  Some are very rich ESPECIALLY these past few months.  If you use an app like ""Coinbase"" you change money into bitcoin.  Say you have $10.  You would buy .00000000000002 (making that number up but it would be very small fraction) in bitcoin.  Say Bitcoin then doubles its price from when you bought and you now have $20 but still .0000000000002.  You just turn it back into your currency again the same way you bought in.  Who buys it from you?  I do along with everyone else that buys it.  If you sell but nobody buys, the price drops because it has no value.  If everyone buys and nobody sells, it now has value and the price goes up.  The end game for some is to not have a ton of traditional currency (FIAT) but to have a ton of Bitcoin to trade.

My argument for Bitcoin:  Everything else is going digital and the world is getting VERY well connected.  Why still have ""exchange rates"" and why wouldn't money also go digital?

Since the intended design is to have bitcoin linked to the real world pricing why does it also not come with the increased power usage that real life farms have to deal with? The fuel price has gone up approximately 4x for metal fuel tanks so why not just increase the fuel consumption up to 4x the speed depending on what is running? This would affect players that do not have much time to play much less while still allowing the nerf to still have its intended effect on players who are using the bitcoin farm to generate massive amounts of roubles.

gki5lli,oarabbus,128,"&gt; not your keys, not your bitcoin


While this is true, this is honestly bad advice to give newbies in the space, unless they are software engineers or generally technical.

99% of the population has 1000x the risk of losing all their Bitcoin by self-managing cold storage compared to leaving it on a US-based exchange.  I’d go as far as to say “not your keys not your Bitcoin use a cold wallet” is downright dangerous advice to give anyone who is *not* a crypto enthusiast and wants to make a first entry into the space.

It’s not 2017 Wild West with MtGox and all that shit. The risk of the Winklevoss twins or Brian Armstrong running away with your money is quite frankly minuscule. You can see their security protocols clearly detailed on their site. The risk of the “rogue engineer” stealing your Bitcoin in 2021 is not very far off the risk of the rogue Wells Fargo engineer clearing out your bank account.

If you’re technically savvy by all means use a hardware or offline wallet. If the terms hash, private key, and cold wallet mean little to you, do NOT use a cold wallet to store even a satoshi until you read up on it and you do.",2021-01-24 15:43:03

You don't HAVE to buy a single WHOLE stock to have a stake in a company.  The same applies to cryptocurrency.

You can buy fractional portions of a stock.  You can literally buy $10 worth of Apple stock right now, it might seem silly, but you absolutely can.

You could buy $5 worth of bitcoin just the same.  There are things to consider regarding how you own it, exchange fees, transfer and such.  I'm offering no advice, but trying to aid in financial literacy, because it boggles my mind when I hear people talking about stocks like they can't possibly afford to get into it at all.

Robinhood, a very simple trading app, allows literally anyone to invest in the market and cryptocurrency, and other commodities as well.  

I'm no expert, but I can't believe how many times I've had to tell people that someone owning a little bitcoin doesn't mean they've got over $30k USD worth of BTC, nor does a person need thousands to invest in anything.  Decimals are a thing, you don't need whole values.

I've got like 0.10 GME right now.  I threw $10 into it on Tuesday for the heck of it. Might put in $100, nothing I'd be devastated to lose, but if I make a little something it's smarter than playing scratchers or powerball any day.",2021-01-28 15:28:49

I had student loans, credit card debt, rent due, no savings, no investments and thought it'd be great to pay down some of that.

I sold batches all the way up to $100, and then again sold more at $1k, then $10k, then $30k. I don't have any more BTC now.

However, I have no debt, a nice house, paid off car, and all those middle class american dream type things my parents never had. So for me, the utility of selling my bitcoin at the time was worth more than the possibility of having more wealth in the future.

I've also contributed to open source blockchain software, played with alt coins, built and dismantled mines, used FPGAs to prototype ASIC designs, and made some good friends along the way - also things I value.

gl9rak6,Earthboom,184,"Answer:

Your own link gives you you the answer. Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency, like bitcoin, that was named after the doge meme. It doesn't do anything special other than being a meme that people bought into. Since its inception, the coin has tanked to hilarious levels although it enjoyed a brief time where it was actually semi valuable. Most coins that aren't bitcoin, called alt coins, rise and fall with bitcoin's success and failures, Dogecoin is no different but because it's a meme, it rises when people give it attention or when comedy becomes important and they need dogecoin to be the punchline. So it has some independence from bitcoin but it's not funny enough to trend independently of bitcoin. 

Recently, however, satoshistreetbets, a crypto currency Wallstreetbets type subreddit, decided to have some fun and coordinated a mass purchasing spree of Dogecoin presumably for the lulz. This was easy to do because the coin was worth garbage so a few bucks would get you thousands of dogecoins. This caught on because of the current trend happening with GME, and what started as a meme is now a legit bull run further fueled by the likes of Elon musk who has a habit of encouraging and going along with current internet pop culture trends targeted to a specific age and political group that I won't go into too much detail on here.

Now that it's making headlines, average people will hop on board the train for fear of missing out (FOMO), because it's pretty much free money at this point further fueling the run. All that being said, for safety and because we're talking about money, it's important to note this post shouldn't count as financial advise. The cryptocurrency scene is ripe with fraud and it's not regulated like Wallstreet is. Furthermore, it's prone to manipulation. As easy as this purchasing spree is happening, so too can a mass sell off be triggered overnight by ""whales"" (people with insane amounts of dogecoin). Unless you really understand basic economics and are attentive to the market trends 24/7, you could easily be left holding the bag or have your coins stolen if you didn't research the right exchange, or any numerous things people have done in the past that boggle the mind. Worst case, you aren't allowed to sell because the exchange you're on is shady and took part in the price manipulation in the first place, or they don't have enough funds to pay you and everyone else out.

In short, lots can happen here unlike with the GME stuff.

My guess is dogecoin will keep ballooning so long as the meme is kept alive and keeps garnering attention until someone big cashes out which will cause a massive panic and it'll tank down to nothing again. This could be done by reddit themselves, Elon, the media reporting some negative press, China, India, the federal government, AOC, literally anything. It's that finicky and volatile.

Hope this answers your question.",2021-01-30 03:36:51
glanbqz,CarelessMiddleFinger,152,"The more people buy Dogecoin the higher the crypto goes, this is the idea of the free market where we the individual investors can come together to make something out of nothing. the idea is to have it skyrocket such as bitcoin did.

Dogecoin has a lot more traction than the crypto price right now is leading you to believe. Dogecoin hasn't shot up as quick as GME because brokers doubled down after the GME surge and limited crypto buying power to money that has already cleared instead of trading on margin (which they disguise as ""instant credit"").

By them doing this, it makes you question wether this is a hoax or the next surge and will cause people to sell out of fear. There are countless amount of people right now just waiting for their funds to post on the broker accounts so that they can buy in. If those of us who are in, hold the line without fear and people continue to purchase once their funds clear, Doge can easily become the next big surge. 

When it does, you should be able to pull some out with profits and still keep much in, so it will continue to grow. If you pull out too early or too much, it won't work as intended and she won't as satisfying as the girl who never got a nut because your nut came too fast.

glgoans,Krakanu,70,"Satoshi Nakamoto is the creator of bitcoin.  Although it's widely agreed that is just a made up name.  It is unclear who the actual creator is. 

Bitcoin has value because others will agree to trade it with you in exchange for goods and services (or other currencies).  It takes a lot of work (made up work, but still work nonetheless) to make new bitcoins via mining.

At first bitcoin was worth literally nothing which is why you hear stories of people losing their early bitcoin stashes because back then not everyone thought they had any value.  It took time for people to trust the system and for the value to ramp up to where it is today.  The value changes a lot because people's opinions of the true value of a bitcoin swing wildly (and it is still unclear what the opinion is of the public/major governments).  Personally, I believe bitcoin has value because it allows you to relatively  easily transfer value to anyone anywhere in the world without any government or corporation being involved in the process.

Ultimately, bitcoin is just a piece of software that creates digital tokens that cannot be duplicated or double spent.  You can't just say ""I have 10 bitcoin"". You have to prove it by showing where it came from.  Every bitcoin can be traced from its current location (someone's digital wallet) all the way back to the original block it was mined from.

Thank you for spreading awareness, people!

There are a lot of so called financial experts on reddit and youtube spreading bullshit about the supply cap of Dogecoin and calling it a worthless memecoin.

Yes, Dogecoin has a supply growth of about 5 billion coins (that's about 4-5% right now) per year, but why is that a problem? The growth is there to keep transaction fees to a minimum.

Dogecoin doesn't need a supply limit like Bitcoin, because in the long run it will be much easier to exchange Dogecoin for goods and services, than with other crypto currencies or regular currencies for that matter.

If Bitcoin wants to become a real global currency with buying power, not just a speculation tool to exchange it for a few thousand debt based USD when it hits a new record high every few months or years, it's supply will have to grow inevitably.

We have to see the bigger picture! Dogecoin will climb to a dollar, but why sell there? We could build a new, fair, balanced monetary system with Dogecoin, not to make a quick profit, but to change the whole world.

Our money is backed by signatures on debt contracts, not on real values. But it works, because we believe in it, even if it will be our downfall if it continues like this.

""You're stupid if you buy Dogecoin, it has no value, it has unlimited supply."" Yeah right, but your fucking US dollar, which is created out of thin air, is backed by debt and is inflating to endlessness, has value? It has a limited supply?  Please, think about that for a few minutes!

Dogecoin has not an unlimited supply in the sense that the supply could grow 10x from one moment to another, devaluing your Dogecoins by a 1000% in an instant, which could happen to any ""normal"" currency and is happening right now to the USD. That's just not possible, because of the way mining Dogecoin works. It has a fixed number of new units every year, so if the value of 1 unit goes up, the percentage of inflation goes down. People need to understand this.

Dogecoin has the possibility to change our perception on money and what money stands for. It can't be backed by signatures on a debt contract, it has to be backed by real goods and services.

It shouldn't be a tool to make a quick buck of when you see the green candle skyrocketing. Dogecoin needs to be more than that. Yes, sell some of it when it hits a dollar, but stay in it for the long run.

Understand and spread awareness of the fact that our current money is valueless, but we all agree with the illusion that it ""works"", so it's still ""valuable"" in the sense that we use it everyday to buy goods and services.

We could apply that same illusion to Dogecoin, but here it would be different, because it's not backed by debt, like the USD is. It would be backed by real values and our trust in it.

Please share the truth and let people know!k",2021-02-01 06:53:22

\- Do NOT trade (it might be tempting I know but don't do it, you will lose money 100%, not 99.9%, 100%).

\- Do NOT fomo. Whenever your hands are shaking and you feel like you need to buy more, don't do it! If the price pumps don't buy.

\- Do NOT fear. If you feel scared and if you feel like you should not buy, this is the moment you should buy instead.

\- Do NOT sell. I sold many times myself and I always bought back at higher price.

\- Do NOT talk to everybody about bitcoin, do not be that kind of friend that only talks about btc, keep in mind this quote from Satoshi.

Because they're hoping it'll get to $100, or because there's a tangible reason to own Doge other than trying to cash in later on?

If people can't give good answers to why Doge is going to have actual longevity and could replace other cryptos like Ethereum or Bitcoin (or any of the other 10 currencies with a higher market cap), then all of this is just a pyramid scheme where early adopters make loads, middle adopters make a bit, and late adopters get left covering the bill once the bubble bursts.",2021-02-03 09:06:08

[Debunking ""Blockchain not Bitcoin""](https://youtu.be/r2f0HlaRdgo)

TO GET STARTED, you need to buy some bitcoin from a Bitcoin exchange. For beginners, I recommend the Cash App for its 2% purchase fees and free withdrawals. Once you buy Bitcoin, withdraw it to a non custodial Bitcoin wallet. This is a wallet where you control the private keys that control your Bitcoin. Don't leave your Bitcoin on an exchange. 

Not your keys, not your coins. Bitcoin is the freedom from needing banks and governments to transfer digital money. Do not use a custodial Bitcoin wallet. Don't put your Bitcoin into someone else's hands. Hold it yourself in a non custodial wallet. Always withdraw your Bitcoin from the exchange where you bought it.
 
I recommend using [Mycelium Bitcoin wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet) for Android.

Make sure to write down your 12 word restore phrase. It can restore your Bitcoin on any device. So keep it safe and secure. No pictures. No typing into a file. Pen and paper only. This phrase essentially IS your Bitcoin because control of your money is unlocked with it. 

Never sell your Bitcoin. Just spend it when you want to take profit. Selling Bitcoin on exchanges lowers the price per Bitcoin. So just spend it directly like how it's supposed to work.

[Purse.io](https://Purse.io) - Buy anything from Amazon using Bitcoin and name your own discount from 5-30%.

[List of stores that accept Bitcoin](https://www.acceptedhere.io/)

When spending or transferring your Bitcoin, there's a transaction fee. (The fee goes to the Bitcoin miner who mines the block that contains that transaction). 

Check https://mempool.space/ to see how low to set your transaction fee. You'll set the transaction fee when sending a payment from your Bitcoin wallet. Some wallets don't offer this option. Don't use those wallets.

And finally, a warning from Jameson Lopp. ""Every bitcoin that is held by an institution is a bitcoin that has had its security weakened by being subjected to bureaucratic and political decision-making. “Not your keys, not your bitcoin” rings true because when you have to ask someone for permission to transact, you are no longer in a position to resist censorship. Bitcoin owners must not trust third parties to act in their best interest!""

Hold your own Bitcoin. Don't let anyone trick you into giving them your Bitcoin. All of those schemes are Ponzi schemes. Nobody is going to give you interest on your Bitcoin, and if they do, they're paying you in a worthless, flawed token. Or they are doing accounting shenanigans that Bitcoin already solved. They will all collapse, and people with think they lost their Bitcoin, when in reality the Bitcoin was lost as soon as you deposited it into the Ponzi scheme.

glw0rl3,Alexx5,54,"&gt;A node is one of the main things that keeps the block chain secure from malicious actors.

No it isn't. It's a common misconception that running is node is somehow a good thing to do for the health and security of the network. The only thing that truly matter is the hash power of the miners. Your full node can do jack shit against an attack if you aren't mining. All you can do is observe.

Having said that, I agree that it's important that the ability to run a node is available to as many people as possible. But running a node is something you do for yourself, not for others. Mining pools, people running services that use the Bitcoin blockchain, and businesses (and sometimes individuals) that deal with very large Bitcoin amounts are the only ones that should run their own nodes.

glvcpnl,bitusher,30,"Bitcoin has gone through many bear and bull markets throughout the years and periods of rapid appreciation followed by a large correction or a bubble. 

This is primarily fueled by More buyers than sellers and Bitcoins disinflationary supply 

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply

The three last bubbles(of many) in Bitcoin are :

**Early 2013 Bubble** A 2 month bull market creep from 20 USD a BTC to 90 USD a BTC before the bubble sets in and the price skyrockets to ~270 usd and than corrects to an average support ~110 USD 

**Late 2013 Bubble** A very slow bull market lasting 6 months bringing the price from ~110 to 290 USD and than skyrocketing up to ~1200 , to than correct to a 800 support declining into a bear market

**2017** - Strong Bull market for 11 months this year bringing bitcoin from ~1k USD to 4.5K USD  followed by a bubble in late November pushing Bitcoin to almost 20k USD a Bitcoin than correcting to a support of ~14k declining in a bear market. 

Note -Bitcoin only remained above 18k that year for 3 days 

This year looks more similar to the 2017 bull market with a long bull market leading to what might be another bubble in early to mid 2021

The supply shock from the last halvening this year on may 11, 2020 is setting in, coupled by institutional investors is really driving this bull market. Eventually I expect a very large correction but I think the ""bubble"" hasn't even really started and we are still in the ""slow"" build up. Notice the July 9, 2016 havening was what had a large impact on the bull market in 2017 and how delayed the impacts of this scarcity takes before the ""bubble"" occurs. This in part is why some like myself see the next bubble occurring mid 2021 with a ""slow"" lead up.... but **you shouldn't trust my or anyone elses ""price predictions""**


The correction typically occurs because their is irrational exuberance/FOMO(fear of missing out) that cannot be sustained and people start taking profits causing panic selling and settling on a corrected support which usually will lead into a bear market


Supply and demand is key and a supply shock creates a vicious cycle of more demand until a new ATH is reached and we fall into another bear cycle. This will likely change in the future when inflation is very low and Bitcoin is less volatile but for now I expect several more years of volatility

The main reasons for the return of the bull market in 2020 are the following

1) The may 11, 2020 halvening created a supply shock where the amount of mined Bitcoin dropped from 12.5 BTC per block inflation to 6.25 BTC block inflation . As you can see with the 6 month delay in the July 9, 2016 halvening creating the 2017 bull market this scarcity takes time to set in which would indicate we are just at the start of the bull market

2) New institutional investors from square, MicroStrategy , MassMutual hedging part of their portfolio in Bitcoin

https://bitcointreasuries.org/

3) Fear of higher taxes due to economic stimulus packages and over spending causing capital flight into bitcoin to avoid taxes and inflation

4) More adoption from retail investors and liquidity options to invest in bitcoin",2021-02-04 00:32:09

gmjl38b,aminok,1,"&gt;I'm new to crypto but I do know about it having an open protocol that is meant to transfer cryptocurrencies to different blockchains. 

Yes, so to further elaborate on that, they have a network of users, that run REN darknodes. Each needs to put up 100,000 REN token as collateral to be able to run a darknode.

These nodes collectively generate a private key, and then create a public deposit address for a blockchain, say Bitcoin, and accept BTC deposits to that address.

The nodes also control an address on Ethereum, that accepts ERC20 token deposits.

When users deposit cryptocurrency to the public address on the other blockchain, the REN darknodes automatically issue ERC20 tokens to that user's address on the Ethereum blockchain, and these ERC20 tokens are 'backed' by the cryptocurrency that being kept in the collectively controlled address on the other blockchain.

When a user send their ERC20 tokens back to the REN-controlled Ethereum address, the REN darknodes will collectively sign a transaction, using multi-party computation, to send cryptocurrency from the address holding the collateral that is backing the ERC20 tokens, to the user's cryptocurrency address.",2021-02-08 12:20:54

In my opinion, the Tesla news that then followed on this historic day has to be considered the adoption singularity. There is no way back from here. We have crossed the Rubicon. I expect the price to adjust much faster to this entirely new situation of large corporations using bitcoin as reserve asset (and when will the first cities or nations follow?) than I had anticipated before. 

A word of warning: Selling here in the thinking ""it has to correct soon and I can buy back lower"" is an almost 100% sure way of ending up with less BTC than before. It's fine to take USD profits of course, but be aware that the market will manage to use almost any action of yours as a way to decrease your bitcoin holdings.

Most people seem to underestimate the gravity of completely *feeless* compared to *almost no fees.* In everyday transactions, nobody ever would come up with the idea of tossing 1c in a jar every time we hand somebody a 10$ bill. In crypto we accept it, because it is the common status quo.

It really is like this: 

fee-less  &gt;&gt;&gt;  tiny fees  &gt;  fees

There are many reasons that speak for Nano and make it an incredibly powerful network in the upcoming economy. Payments are the first and most obvious use-case for DLTs, that's why the proof-of-concept of permissionless Blockchains, Bitcoin, was orginally intended to be a P2P cash system as well. Money is an information system, and decentralizing it closes the trust-gap.

Furthermore, **Global transactions** will only become more in volume, and more common for regular people. The same holds true for **Micro transactions** as our economy will shift more towards pay2rent and pay2use services (especially online). The capability to quickly transfer value for free, and the economy that can be built on top of this is still out of grasp for most of us.

Imagine for example gaming. Instead of charging any particular accounts (steam, xbox live, fortnite) you just transfer quickly and uncomplicated out of your own wallet. No need for an individual account with any of these, no need for an in-game currency. No need for any intermediary. And that's just one possible usecase among literally thousands.

Additionally comes, that Nano doesn't compete with DeFi (Finanical Services), Smart Contract platforms or any other, more elaborate use-cases. It can and will blissfully coexist with ETH, ADA, IOTA, VET and other elaborate DLTs.

It revolutionizes the **""payments-industry""**, nothing besides that. No extra layers, no complications, ""do one thing and do it well"", and that is Nano's design philosophy. Payments affect almost every single person almost every single day. Nano really is the Internet of payments, but with in-built egalitarian, non-discriminative, sustainable, qualities on the protocol level.

And to everybody saying I am shilling Nano: I am not talking good about Nano because I am financially invested. I am financially invested because i can only talk good about Nano.

The idea of not pushing all transactions onto one blockchain, and instead build an ever-expanding **grid of theoretically infinite intertwined blockchains**, is fucking genius. It's absolutely superb design. Even non-fans that love technology must appreciate this.

I believe most of us cannot even remotely grasp yet the full potential of a fee-less (not super cheap!), decentralized payments network. And for those that do, Nano is the way.",2021-02-10 18:03:49

Crypto is volatile and risky.

The safer bet is bitcoin. The riskier play is Alt coins.

gmtxuti,dhork,879,"While every Bitcoin holder is welcoming the increase in price, right now, I feel like it's bad for the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole. The difficulty of Bitcoin mining increases with the number of people doing it. Blocks are mined about every 10 minutes. There is a block reward of 6.25 BTC per block mined.... But with BTC now over $40k, that means that every block found rewards it's finder with $250k. Every 10 minutes. It's as if Tesla decided to release 300 new shares every 10 minutes, yet still the price goes up!

So since miners essentially turn electricity into blocks, this high block reward incentives miners to use as much cheap electricity as they can. Bitcoin's energy footprint is directly related to it's price (and the block reward). As long as price goes up, so does it's energy footprint.

If there's a silver lining, it's that the protocol developers designed the reward to decrease over time and eventually be eliminated. The block reward is halved (roughly) every 4 years, so in 20 years the block reward will be a shade under .2 BTC. For the block rewards to be equivalent to right now, BTC would have to be worth $1.25 million by then. Seems unlikely, but back in 2012 when I first started getting into it BTC at $40k seemed unlikely, too.",2021-02-11 01:28:41

So why is ethereum more valuable than bitcoin?

Bitcoin is valuable because it's a hedge against inflation. There is a hard cap of 21 million bitcoin. The issuance that bitcoin miners received is cut in half every 4 years, making bitcoin rely on transaction fees more and makes bitcoins monetary policy stronger.

Ethereum decided to solve a problem with determining an appropriate gas price and ended up creating eip-1559 which when combined with the merger (fully pos ethereum), it will likely make ethereum have a slightly deflationary supply.

Ethereum will get better gas pricing estimates, variable sized blocks to handle congestion, and a better monetary policy from eip-1559.

DeFi is the _killer_ feature of ethereum and DeFi has been exploding the last few weeks due to the gme incident. DeFi is just going to get better with zero knowledge rollups and even better when sharding is ready.

gmyt99z,Red4141,25,"From a crypto firm...

The great thing about DeFi is that it’s global, has relatively low fees (once Ethereum scales), few intermediaries, transparent fair rules for everyone, and the trade is the settlement. It gets rid of the rigged system and replaces it with a shared public infrastructure that cannot be rigged. No broker can ratchet up collateral requirements because there is no gatekeeper broker. The clearinghouse is just a smart contract. Since everything is automated and happens via smart contracts, a trade either happens or it doesn’t. There is not + 2 days, but instead “trade intent” + 30 seconds. Once your trade gets confirmed on Ethereum, it’s final, and that’s it. And since these systems are global, anyone can access them anywhere in the world; it just takes a smartphone or computer and some cryptocurrency. The advent of DeFi mitigates the main problems and rigged parts of the system these Redditors were frustrated with.  


When you use DeFi, you’ll realize finance is never going back. The moment I internalized that this was for sure the way the future is going was in 2020. This may surprise some people, given that I’ve been building in the DeFi space since 2014. But I was 90% confident for a very long time, and it wasn’t until last year when I became 99.9% convinced that DeFi is the future of finance. I wanted to trade from one asset into another. I had one cryptocurrency that was a token on Ethereum. I needed dollars to send to an OTC desk to get me a cryptocurrency from an exchange that didn’t trade in the US market. I used a decentralized exchange aggregator (a site that routes your order across dozens of decentralized token exchanges and gets you the best price) and traded that first token for USDC. The price I got was better than any OTC desk quoted me for the same trade. Ordinarily, I would've had to send it to a centralized exchange first, wait a while, trade it, and withdraw the USDC, which usually retakes a bit. Once I had the USDC, I sent the USDC to an OTC desk (at about 2 AM, when the banking system would’ve been closed). The OTC desk bought me the new token and then sent it to my wallet for that blockchain a few hours later.  


So what just happened there is insanely cool. I’d have to sell the initial position in traditional finance, withdraw dollars after waiting for settlement, and wait for the wire to process (so three days so far). Then the foreign OTC desk could buy me the asset I needed. And I’d probably pay a fair amount of fees along the way too. And I certainly couldn’t have done it at 2 AM because nothing would’ve been open (neither my bank nor the market). Crypto markets trade 24/7.  


Just the other night, I was getting indicative quotes on a 1000 ETH trade, and decentralized exchange aggregators offered lower slippage than Coinbase Prime. This feels like a watershed moment for the DeFi space. Not only is it a better system in theory, but it is also actually starting to become more useful to crypto users than other centralized systems. Companies like Coinbase will always help onboarding users to crypto from fiat/USD. Still, for crypto to crypto and stable coins &lt;&gt; crypto, DEXes will begin to dominate. Ethereum is the asset at the forefront of all of this. Even after its recent run-up, it still trades at a P/S ratio of 40x, which will become earnings for ETH stakers when value switches to Ethereum 2.0. Revenue on Ethereum has grown over 400x since January 2020. It’s an insanely cheap asset compared to anything else in the public markets with that kind of growth relative to its revenue multiple. It’s not entirely crazy to see Ethereum being able to 5-10x from here, especially when compared to traditional equities markets. Ethereum is the base layer of this new open financial system. The vast majority of the value in that system is transacting on top of smart contracts written on Ethereum. The net present value of the global settlement layer's transaction fees for all of finance is a considerable number. We have positioned the Pantera Liquid Token Fund around the opportunities surrounding decentralized finance and the Ethereum ecosystem for all the reasons above. 

 The fund was up 98% in January versus BTC up 15%. We think that similar to the last cycle, Bitcoin dominance (BTC’s percent of overall market cap in the space) will eventually go down into the forties again. In our view, the primary beneficiaries are likely to be Ethereum and Ethereum based decentralized finance assets, as well as eventually DeFi assets on other chains like Polkadot later in the year. This outperformance so far has mainly been due to our positioning surrounding DeFi (and some due to catching an opportune time to take some risk off after BTC hit $40k). These significant innovations we talked about above are only \*4%\* of the total cryptocurrency market cap. By the end of this cycle, we think they could potentially be 20%, or a relative outperformance of 5x.",2021-02-12 03:29:21

   * Ethereum is the most utilized crypto platform in the world, with more fees being paid to Ethereum miners than any other project's. The dominance extends beyond just Ethereum, to Ethereum-based dApps, with seven of the next nine largest revenue earning crypto projects in the world being based on Ethereum, as this charts shows with all the projects highlighted in pink being Ethereum-based: [https://cryptofees.info](https://cryptofees.info)
   * All major DeFi applications operate on Ethereum. [Tracked by DefiPulse](https://defipulse.com/). These DeFi apps are all interacting to create an increasingly sophisticated open financial system on Ethereum that gives the platform an increasingly insurmountable advantage over potential competitors.
   * All of the major stablecoins; Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), True USD (TUSD), Binance USD (BUSD), and Paxos Standard (PAX), use the ERC20 standard.
* Beyond market adoption, the Ethereum development community is by far the largest in the cryptocurrency space, and its advantage over all other smart contract platforms has rapidly grown over the last three years:
   * Ethereum has an overwhelming lead over all other cryptocurrency and blockchain projects in the number of developers working on it according to the recently released [Electric Capital Developer Report (2020)](https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2020-9417165c6444). This lead is accelerating, with a 215% increase in the number of developers working on Ethereum since 2017, and with the number of monthly developers increasing by 300+ between Q3 2019 and Q3 2020, which bucked the downward trend seen in the rest of the cryptocurrency market. [(source)](https://i.imgur.com/Hfo9rTP.jpg)
   * The overwhelming majority of Research and Development on blockchain scalability is being done on Ethereum-based projects [(source)](https://github.com/Awesome-Layer-2/awesome-layer-2). Groundbreaking scalability solutions that have recently launched on Ethereum Mainnet include Loopring and zkSync, which use zkRollUp technology to enable thousands of transactions per second to be processed on Ethereum layer 1: [(source)](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-pay-is-live-zkrollup-transfers-on-ethereum-770d35213408) The misinformation you'll hear too much
   * Ethereum's [developer tool list](https://github.com/ConsenSys/ethereum-developer-tools-list) outshines everything out there. Getting smart contract to work properly is complex, and there is no magic port that will can do that realistically (no matter what others might shill). These are years of tools from thousands of developers. Having smart contract functionality means little compared to the tool list needed to use it effectively.
   * Every other project still needs years to have all these tools, for what? A blockchain that has some trivial perk (assuming it's a perk). By the time they have these tools (years away) ETH 2.0 and a whole new paradigm of functionally will be in place. [Again, there are thousands and thousand of ethereum developers, no other project comes close.](https://i.imgur.com/Hfo9rTP.jpg)
   * Note, there's some that think moving tokens (ERC20) from one blockchain to another is a big deal. It's not. There are no simple converters for the broader blockchain functionality. This is not a push button process. An ERC20 token is not the real world application being converted, it's just a simple token. Nothing special.
* ETH 2.0 model outshines all in the areas of decentralization. There's a lot of discussion about types of ""Proof-of-Stake"" (a validation method of the blockchain ledger). ETH 2.0 allows individuals to stake (validate) the ledger. Projects that claim to be cheaper/faster use delegators (cartels), often calling their method ""Delegated"" or ""Dynamic"" Proof-of-Stake (or other names), which essentially forces control of the chain in to groups, so for example, exchanges could assume control. ETH 2.0 stakers can opt in to join pools, but pools are not required. Got 32 ETH? You can stake as a individual.

**Ethereum's supply (and other common new-person questions about ethereum)**

* ETH is not capped, but restricted, capped is unlikely to be secure. Ethereum's monetary policy is best described as ""minimum issuance to secure the network""
* ETH issuance and burn is more sophisticated than Bitcoin. Under EIP-1559, some ETH get's burned (removed), which is projected to be greater than issuance (created). Everything is about creating a stable network, rather than and arbitrary cap. Bitcoin IS inflationary, and will be until we're all dead. Ethereum has a true deflationary mechanism
* What I see - anyone saying that ETH isn't scarce or anyone saying a ""hard cap"" is healthy for blockchains:
   * doesn't understand math and securing blockchain systems
   * is purposely deceitful
   * trying to pitch their corpo-coin
* You might hear someone say ""immutable"" or ""code is law"" or similar topics, in references to ethereum's early history. Young blockchains are technologies that often have issues that needed sorted out to build trust. Bitcoin had a really bad event that had to be fixed (lots of bitcoins were generated by an exploit). But it got repaired. Ethereum had a similar event, and some will try to split hairs about how Ethereum's event was different. In the end, blockchains require trust or they will not be validated. In the end, Ethereum has garnered that trust, by devs, by investors, and just starting, industry.
* What about ""eth-killer"" (enter whatever) doing such and such?
   * The graveyard of ""eth-killers"" is VAST:  ICX. QTUM. VET. ZIL. EOS. ONT. XTZ. IOTA. NEO. STRAT. AION, Rootstock, ETC (to name a few). We have a new wave of them now. My advice. Stop pretending you can ""kill"" ethereum and starting thinking how you can contribute to the world ethereum is creating.
   * But the gas-fees are too high... Yes, they are. Because the chain is being used. But L2 (above chain) solutions are already out ([an example](https://blog.synthetix.io/l2-mainnet-launch/)) for developers to start using. Plus other updates coming in a few months, such as  EIP-1559 and the GETH client this summer (which makes a lot of upgrades). FUDing gas costs now though is justified, but don't think untested/unused projects have any edge, especially with upgrades on a functioning chain (ethereum) are here, with more coming.

**More opinion, not advice**

* The order of importance is Ethereum, Bitcoin than any of the players trying to innovate the space, which are overwhelmingly building on Ethereum.
* I no longer see any other independent blockchain as relevant compared to Ethereum. I did a few years ago, but many of those projects failed their vision, some disappointed greatly
* Ethereum 2.0 will easily cover my prior concerns. So to me, it's done - if blockchains have a future, it's Ethereum's future. (mostly)
* I do see plenty of interesting defi projects (on Ethereum, of course). They are all MUCH higher risk than Ethereum. itself.
* I have a minority opinion, it seems Bitcoin is irrelevant compared to Ethereum. It's more just name recognition.
   * Ethereum already does more than Bitcoin, including more transactions, but that's not the reason I see Bitcoin as irrelevant
   * The major valid argument supporting Bitcoin (compared to ETH) is that it is a simple blockchain. It remains a powerful upgrade to gold, a better store of value. Ethereum, while more capable, involves innovations, which adds potential risks. AND ETH 2.0 is not fully here yet
   * I do, somewhat, agree with the above argument, in the short term, but if ETH 2.0 works (and it seems it will) and it fully becomes a computer-ledger for the world (a bigger ""what if"" for all crypto), then ETH becomes a more fundamental resource to society than Bitcoin. ETH, then, is a better store of value. Bitcoin is irrelevant.
* Working together - I see it. Other chains (yes, which ever one you're holding bags for) may still be around in a couple of years. To Kill Ethereum, you need to do something absolutely unexpected, like turning a phone into a camera. Turning gold digital. Turning digital gold into an app store (Ethereum). What's next? Something HUGE, I suspect some day, but NOTHING I see now in this space is anything other than just a shadow/subordinate of Ethereum (in my opinion).",2021-02-14 10:24:22

gnduooy,Tricky_Troll,38,"Here's a response of mine from further down which I think is going to get buried:

It's basically answering why I think that Cardano or any other ETH killers won't overtake Ethereum.

- Ethereum has the largest network effect of any smart contract platform (Don't underestimate network effects. Why else would an obsolete blockchain like Bitcoin still be number 1? Imagine how much effort is required to migrate all of DeFi onto a new chain. It would be like moving a mountain with a shovel).

- Ethereum is the only chain with valuable block space. The reason why gas fees are so high is because people are willing to pay a premium for the superior settlement guarantees, decentralisation and composability with the wide range of DeFi apps.

- Ethereum is the most provably neutral and decentralised. Most chains which have better scalability have given up decentralisation to achieve it. Something which Cardano proponents often brag about is the ease of staking, but this is actually because it is delegating stake. This results in more centralisation and less node operators. On Ethereum, if you want to stake without a separate entity like RocketPool or other staking pools, you have to stake 32 ETH. No more, no less. This makes staking harder for whales too as they have to run more validators. This has an extra effect on reducing the prominence of whales. I mean, just look at this chart of validator whales. It's so damn decentralised!",2021-02-14 19:47:24

Be vigilant everyone. These ""debates"" in cryptocommunities tend to end up being divisive. The narrative can quickly change and we can find ourselves in the minority.

Then when I researched Stellar, I was impressed with the goal but didn't really think it was all that.. when I subsequently researched bitcoin, I thought, ""how is bitcoin even valuable at all?""

Then I went back and researched even more about sdf, and I am fully bought in. There is actual value behind XLM, like, legit utility..

My question is, are there other coins with as much utility potential as XLM. I can't seem to find one. I see a lot of ethereum based tokens, but my research on ethereum led me to believe it'll be a bust. Do I just have confirmation bias or is XLM actually the only long term valuable coin at the moment?",2021-02-15 02:37:24

&gt;Due to the rapid rise in some cryptocurrency prices, foundries that churn out semiconductors have months of backlogs due to GPU and ASIC demand.  Why?  Because there are only a small handful of foundries capable of manufacturing state-of-the-art chips and as a result there is a limited capacity irrespective of what the ultimate destination may be.  

&gt;This has led to a shortage of chips used in automobiles to the point where large manufacturers such as Ford or General Motors (GM) have announced plant shutdowns.  In its most recent earnings announcement, GM estimated that:  

&gt;The semiconductor shortage will shave $1.5 billion to $2 billion off adjusted earnings before interest and taxes this year.  

&gt;How much semiconductor output capacity is being squeezed because of PoW miners?  

&gt;Digiconomist estimates that TSMC – the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world which produces most, if not all, ASICs for cryptocurrency mining – would need 3-4 months at full-capacity of its 7nm output just to produce the ASICs for PoW mining equipment that have been ordered.

I will concede a couple of points:

1.  I didn't think we'd see so many dead altcoins pump this cycle
2. ETH will have to execute the strategy that it's laid out for staking, EIP-1559, Berlin, and ETH 2.0.  I think the market is ready but won't brook a 6 month delay.

Why do I think this is the Amazon moment?

&amp;#x200B;

1.  Defi is maturing at a rapid pace
2. Bitcoin has become culturally accepted by institutions, CEOs, and other king makers.  I believe ETH will find the same acceptance in the next 6-12 months
3. The tech roadmap for ETH is laid out for continued improvement to the protocol over the next 2 years
4. Dapps are there and ready to capitalize on ETH's scaling improvements.  There will be so much creativity in the crypto space ready to take advantage of improvements to Ethereum.

This isn't to say that ETH will be $10,000 by 2022.  Amazon's stock price has taken 20 years to get from the bottom to where it is today.  I just believe that the days of ""wait until crypto crashes 80% to buy"" are over.

Bitcoin is the best performing asset of the year, the decade, possibly of all time. It's grown by around 500% in the last year; by around 11,000% since 2015. Those are *incredible* gains. What a time to be alive and have the good sense to invest now or the recent past in bitcoin.

Yet those gains are not enough for some people. They want *more*. So they go to Celsius and hand over their keys for an additional [6.2%](https://celsius.network/earn-rewards-on-your-crypto/) on their annual return on their bitcoin. Put differently, to change the annual return on bitcoin from 500% to 506.2%, you hand over your bitcoin to some company and pray that it does not go the way of Mt. Gox.

This sounds insane to me. It sounds reckless. It's a bearish signal because the reward does not in any way outweigh the risk. Simply put, it's *greedy*, and we all know what Buffet says you should do when everyone else is greedy.

gnkr1r5,FrankieSaints,5,"I don't know much about Eth, but the fees you described are exactly how it works on Bitcoin. If it costs $5 to send $100,000 you can choose for the fee to be $4.50 and save yourself 50¢

If there are hundreds of transactions waiting in the $4.51-$4.99 range, those will be processed first, and your $100k transaction sits in limbo until all transactions willing to pay $4.51+ are done.

On the flip side, if transactions are costing $5 in fees and you wanted to jump the line, you can choose $20 in fees and you'll be head of the line, taken care of first.

The fees creep up as more transactions at that price are requested. Say 1,000 transactions are waiting at $4.99 to $5.01.... the person paying $5.02 will jump ahead of the line, someone at $4.99 gets tired of waiting and retries at $5.05, someone else at $5.15, etc, and that's how the fees rise.

Now let's go worst case scenario: BTC is falling like a rock, everyone is trying to cash out. When thousands or millions are on the line, all of a sudden a $40 transaction fee doesn't sound so bad, and the surge of volume has people justifying higher and higher transaction fees so they can GTFO. I believe the 2017 crisis hit $55 fees (in other words - it doesn't matter how much money was in your transaction, you were paying $50+ or you were waiting indefinitely).",2021-02-16 06:28:29

In fact, I could imagine a world when authorities straight up ban cryptos.  The more it becomes mass adoption, regulations (direct or indirect) will kick in.  Smart money cannot be in love with cryptos where Trillions aren't flowing in the normal market.

Those big firms jumping in the train is also a double edged sword.  Very good short term for the price, then later on you realize they are able to manipulate the price somehow and profit from it leaving retail on the side, once again.

[Survival of the Richest: The wealthy are plotting to leave us behind](https://onezero.medium.com/survival-of-the-richest-9ef6cddd0cc1)

&gt; After I arrived, I was ushered into what I thought was the green room. But instead of being
wired with a microphone or taken to a stage, I just sat there at a plain round table as my
audience was brought to me: five super-wealthy guys — yes, all men — from the upper
echelon of the hedge fund world. After a bit of small talk, I realized they had no interest in the
information I had prepared about the future of technology. They had come with questions of
their own.

&gt; They started out innocuously enough. Ethereum or bitcoin? Is quantum computing a real
thing? Slowly but surely, however, they edged into their real topics of concern.
Which region will be less impacted by the coming climate crisis: New Zealand or Alaska? Is
Google really building Ray Kurzweil a home for his brain, and will his consciousness live
through the transition, or will it die and be reborn as a whole new one?

&gt; Finally, the CEO of a brokerage house explained that he had nearly completed building his own underground
bunker system and asked, “How do I maintain authority over my security force after the
event?”

&gt; The Event. That was their euphemism for the environmental collapse, social unrest, nuclear
explosion, unstoppable virus, or Mr. Robot hack that takes everything down.
This single question occupied us for the rest of the hour. They knew armed guards would be
required to protect their compounds from the angry mobs. But how would they pay the
guards once money was worthless? What would stop the guards from choosing their own
leader? The billionaires considered using special combination locks on the food supply that
only they knew. Or making guards wear disciplinary collars of some kind in return for their
survival. Or maybe building robots to serve as guards and workers — if that technology could
be developed in time.",2021-02-19 13:49:18

gnxv1w5,NotCloseToFour,17,"There is a thread that was posted a few hours ago that is asking about Litecoin's price peak for this bull run.  I took a few minutes to write out this reply, so I might as well share it here too:

$2.5k to $6k is my prediction.  A lot of people will come and accuse me of pure hopium, but I do think that this range is very reasonable given the market conditions.

First off, I believe that Litecoin will surpass a price of $1k prior to this summer.  Both the LTC to USD and BTC charts look extremely bullish.  With Bitcoin being over $50k, Litecoin doesn't even need a .02 ratio to get to $1k.  I do believe that between now and the end of May, there will be massive gains on the Bitcoin ratio, which will bring us to $1k and beyond.  Not only do the charts look poised for a move up, but it is lining up with a pretty favorable lineup of positive news for Litecoin: Mimblewimble entering the code complete phase, possible news on Mimblewimble deploy date, Paypal/Venmo crypto integration that includes Litecoin, Flare network integration, massive Grayscale investments in Litecoin, etc.  The timing just makes sense.

Second, I can definitely see Bitcoin reaching a $250k to $300k price point this run.  I believe that the $1.5b Tesla investment is the start of what will be a trend of larger corporations adding cryptocurrencies to their books.  Not to mention the fact that there is already a lot more institutional interest in cryptocurrencies this time around compared to 2017 (see Grayscale).  With this additional institutional interest, we are definitely heading for a supply shortage that could see the price move much higher.  Bitcoin is the high tide that raises all ships.  If Litecoin regains its .02 ratio against Bitcoin, a $300k Bitcoin would bring Litecoin to the $6k at the top of my range.  Even if a .02 ratio never happens again, Bitcoin performing strong still helps Litecoin.

Third and finally, we are talking about blow off tops here.  Just based on how these blow off tops have performed in the past, they move quickly and violently, and they aren't exactly based on reason.  Once the FOMO hits, its a free-for-all on where the price may land.  If $6k does hit, I don't think it will be for very long - Litecoin only hit $420 for a split second during the last run.  No one should really be trying to time the top.  The better strategy is to sell on the way up.

So to conclude - I do think some people are underselling the price potential of Litecoin during this upcoming bull run.  As far as I'm concerned, $1k is a foregone conclusion, and the 2021 price top is well beyond that.  How much beyond that is obviously the million dollar quesiton.  Compared to other coins, Litecoin has had a slow start in 2021, but over the next few months, this thing is going to start moving quick.",2021-02-19 07:31:03

1. The experience people were getting from centralized exchanges is not great. People are excited about the products we've been building in DeFi, with LPs and farming.  When BNB made a low-friction path to those products available, they got immediate mainstream adoption from the RobinHood gang.
2. Binance Chain Wallet is onboarding people to the idea of in-browser wallets as a substitute for accounts and logins.  If they want their marketplace to stay relevant, they'll build seamless network swapping of assets right into the wallet.  Binance bridge sucks, blocks small transactions and US users and then just stops working altogether.
3. BSC is basically a new Ethereum distro. I'm sure the Debian people were peeved when RedHat forked but really, this is great for the ecosystem.

“in 2017 ... LTC when BTC explodes - a story

Well, as it seems to always be - the Litecoin Gods require tears, sweat, and blood. You must cry until your face feels weak and crusted with salt. Your clothes must fill and drip with sweat, and your fingers must freely flow blood from their worn furiously typing stumps. Only then will the Litecoin Gods take note.

But then they look on you with pity and smite you again. Down the ratio falls - 0.015, 0.013, 0.011... your heart churns at each step. ""Am I an idiot,"" you ask yourself. ""Am I a person that is destined to lose it all with bad investment decisions?"" You lash out online and in your soul. People around you don't know the raw flame of horror that burns deep inside turning nausea into pain into emptiness and back again. Bitcoin rises, shattering all expectation. The Litecoin Gods near their satisfaction.

Yet hold! HOLD you hear - you scream in desperation! Beaten and weak, drained and scared, you watch the ratio slow its nightmarish descent... 0.0105, 0.01... this must be it. How could it fa-- 0.0098!!! You shriek in agony at the zero digits! NO! No! How could this be? How could this possibly be?!

And as the ratio explores the depths of this new hole - the &lt;0.01 hole - you lose all hope. There is nothing you care about. The world is empty and dull. All that grows is self-hatred day-by-day, but even with that you feel apathy. The soul, festering with maggots and mold, decays within you.

But then, one night while you sleep... the Litecoin Gods chuckle having had their fill...

↓ 0.00565 ⛧0.00564 ↑ 0.00565

AND UP IT SHOOTS - past every number you couldn't stand to see - above 0.007, 0.008, 0.009, and even 0.01! For a moment you think to sell, but those thoughts are wiped clean. Litecoin was never a bad decision! Up and up - 0.013, 0.018 - you watch closely as it nears your break-even of 0.022 - what? Sorry I can't go out tonight I'm busy - the numbers flash across the screen as unbelievable capital flows into chikun coin! You knew it! You KNEW it!

↑↑↑ 0.03521

go6ciwp,Y_crab_Y,1,"Short answer is yes and yes, but there will always be a fee.

Long version...Sorry if this covers anything you already know...
Sender includes a fee with every transaction (in sat per byte) &amp; can choose how high to set it. 

The transactions go into the mempool and miners choose transactions (tx) to include in each block. Because they get the fee, generally going to choose higher fee txs first. 

At busy times when mempool fills with unconfirmed txs, senders will up their fee in a bid to have their transaction confirmed before others.

When users withdraw, coinbase will send txs with appropriate fee estimated to have them confirmed reasonably quickly.

When coinbase send out a tx, there could be many outputs to numerous user addresses in that tx, so the tx fee could be split amongst users, but the important point is coinbase dictate the fee applied, which varies.

Right now, fees seem high because the bull run is causing a spike in transactions (increasing sat/byte fee) and bitcoin at all time $ highs (increasing $ per sat). Was similar in 17.

Not much help now, but once you have BTC in your wallet, you'll be able to set fee yourself when you send next based on your time preference. 

Here's a link to mempool stats, which show pending transactions and current fees in sat/byte. Dont think we'll have low fees for a while.

The flip side to that is if you are not very organized or lose/misplace things easily then either have a lot of accessible backups in safe secure places or last resort leave it on Coinbase.

Litecoin is fundamentally similar to Bitcoin in terms of things like disinflation rate and halving cycles. The only major differences are the circulating supply, block time, and algorithm (Scrypt vs SHA-256). Therefore, it’s easier and more comforting to speculate that Litecoin’s price will spike up in a certain way by looking at Bitcoin’s historical price vs its disinflation rate.

It’s undervalued compared to what it should be worth (compare the Grayscale LCTN trust premium to LCT market price), but people are starting to notice that. Grayscale hoarding it is making people slowly wake up and start getting into it.

80% of it will be mined this year. When 80% of Bitcoin was mined in 2017, it’s price exploded by 19x in that year alone.

Paypal will support Litecoin as one of only 4 cryptos they’re currently suppoting, so its going to be useful for more than just gambling.

Litecoin has stayed in the top 10 list since its inception despite some new kids on the block like BNB, ADA, and DOT that I never heard of kicking it down a couple places. I am hoping for this trend to reverse.

gocx1y6,Merlin560,64,"Pnf Review.

This is a long one.  Get out your pencils and take notes.  This one will show you how to trade a situation like today.

[My annotated PnF chart](https://imgur.com/a/dS7Ry3s)

Today I wanted to post my version of the chart so you can see how to make some sense of this type of action on the chart.

The first thing to notice is that we were in a long pole warning.  That is where the LPW in purple is.  That means were are four boxes above the breakout (the green x.). This means the price has gone up too much without “support.”  It is ripe for a reversal.

The column going up had 17 boxes, so when it reversed, the expectation would be where the LPW Reversal Target arrow is pointed.  That would have been the first place you look for support.

We clearly blew through that, taking out stops on the way down.

The next stop would be the “local support.”  This is the boxes with the red \* in them.  This is a diagonal line up from the LAST low column.  This moves up and to the right every time we add a column.

Today that price would have been $51,413.

That clearly did not hold…so we were really falling hard.

The NEXT stop would have been the Negative Break Down Point.  That is listed as the NBD box and that is found one box LOWER than the previous low.  What this means is that we are about to break down, and probably form a new formation.  Local support is gone and we will continue down.

How much “should” we go down.  There are three ways to look at this.  First is to count the width of the formation.  In this case, marked in blue, the count is four columns.  If you add that number in boxes moving down you would be at $48,434.

The second way is to count the length of the last breakdown.  This goes back over a couple of columns…and the length of the column is 7 boxes.  If you overlay that on top of this column you can see we already exceeded that move.  That's OK…this why we look at different things.

Finally, you start looking at previous local support.  In this case it is again listed as he red asterisks coming up from the left.  The low target there is $47,80.  We did not quite get there is this time around.

To see support going down, you would just repeat this process using the previous support times.  I usually don’t keep them on my charts, just to keep them clean.

So if you were shorting this move, you would use those target levels to set the general areas where things “should” behave.    When it hit one of those support areas you would start looking for a reversal (moving BACK UP 3 BOXES.) . Sure you will lose catching the bottom, but the bounce back up could be good for a few percentage point gain.  

Keep in mind this is Bitcoin.  Bitcoin doesn’t give a shit about you or me.  It doesn't care about my chart..  It **ALWAYS** moves a little more than it should.  But it usually is close enough.  If you watch it.  NEVER blindly jump in on a move like this unless you are sitting on like a momma hen.

If you were to look at a ""normal one-day candlestick chart"" the low for this run is as obvious as the back of your hand.  You might not be able to pin a specific number, but if you can draw a straight line where things bounced around you can see it, plain as day.

If you are looking for TA to give you specific numbers, I would recommend Tarot cards.  You will be as lucky.  At least, Tarot cards are supposed to make you think about the message.

Setting up a chart like this from the one I usually link takes 5 minutes a day MAX.  It is MORE useful when trading traditional stocks (not high flying WSB stocks, but normal boring stocks.)

I don’t do a lot of day trading.  I do some swing trading.  This is more a daily routine than anything else.  What it DOES provide me is some “peace of mind” when it is dropping.  I “know” where things should go, and adjust my emotions accordingly.

If you are not using a system, any system, to assess your risk you are going to lose money.  

Don’t lose money.

I hope you found this helpful.  I hate watching people get worked up and lose money.  This doesn't have to be a casino.",2021-02-23 02:09:27

gol0dkb,fractalfiction,392,"Honest question: how are the billionaires and hedge funds in control of  Bitcoin? 

The savvy investors/lucky speculators of blockchain tokens have had 10+ years to accumulate an asset that has gone up tens of thousands of percent, before any billionaire or institution even dipped their toes into it (publicly). This is very different from an asset class or market like Wall St, which has been a gated playground for the rich and institutions for over a century.

I think we are still early to this party. There are plenty of smart people that have uncovered market patterns that help retail investors like us to finally get a leg up on an investment that hasn't been completely frontrunned by the banks and billionaires.

I think that the new wave of smart contract blockchain projects like polkadot, cardano, avalanche, etc... will be foundational and give the retail investors opportunities to shape the way the new financial system could work. BTC can remain the store of value in the public domain, but we're still on the first or second floor of the new Proof of Stake skyscrapers. 


Finally, we need billionaires to push the market cap to where we all ultimately want to see BTC and the crypto asset class. They are the rocket fuel that can propel us to the moon. Without them investing billions and bringing BTC into the spotlight, good luck getting enough blue collar nerds invest enough to squeeze a few lambos out of some fringe speculation that isn't even institutionally adopted.

Nobody's celebrating any development milestone, they probably can't even tell you what the tech is about at all, but they sure celebrate a big BTC buy for Tesla's reserves.

gogvrju,Atlas_Black,161,"Want a sad story?

In 2009, when Bitcoin was less than $0.01/BTC, a friend of mine gave me $20 worth of BTC for my 19th birthday in June. 

He told me to hang onto it and it would be worth a lot of money one day. He tried explaining it to me in ways that sounded crazy, using phrases like:

- Universal currency. 
- Money of the future. 
- Completely digital source of income. 

Just stuff like that. 

I didn’t take it seriously, so 6 months later, in December... My 2 year anniversary with the girl I had been dating was coming up. I felt like doing something special, but I was jobless at that time. So I sold all 2130 shares of my Bitcoin for a profit of $1.67. 

With $21.67 in hand, I went to the store, bought the ingredients for her favorite meal, bought some flowers, and went to her place to get cooking. 

It was a really nice dinner. Totally crushed it. She was smiling through every bite. We talked, we laughed, we had a good time. She complimented the meal, and then dumped me as I was clearing the table. 

... Yeah... It came out of nowhere for me too. 

I didn’t give it much thought until December 2017, when Bitcoin came up in my new circle of friends. It was at $19,000 per BTC. They were all talking about how they had missed their chance to get in on it, and I just started thinking back to my birthday in 2009, and what that friend said, and how I had thought it sounded crazy. 

But what was really crazy is that I got dumped ON my 2 year anniversary, AFTER I had cooked that girl a plate of Fettuccine Alfredo that, adjusting for the modern BTC price, would be worth $40,470,000 dollars in December of 2017.

A few days ago, that Fettuccine Alfredo was worth $125,670,000. 

I tried looking up the friend who gifted it to me. We had lost touch after I moved out of state. All of his social media had been deactivated, but I was still friends with his sister on Facebook and Instagram.

Through some of her posts, I found out her brother (my old friend) had paid off his parents house, bought his sister a house, bought himself a house, sent his sisters to college, bought everyone in his immediate family new cars, and then stopped spending. 

The houses aren’t huge. He’s living very modestly for how much money he has. He just wanted to set up his family with all they needed and then be comfortable forever. 

I know for a fact he has an obscene amount of BTC left, or cashed it out for a ridiculous amount of money, because when he gave me my $20 worth, he told me that he had invested all $8000 of his savings into BTC. 

If $20 would have been worth $125million... His $8000 would be worth TENS OF BILLIONS (depending on when he sold).

Aaaand that could have been me as well.

Monetary stimuli being sucked into things that are unrelated to the “real economy” is the real thief here imo. Pumping in trillions into the stock market has marginal to no value when the same companies can borrow at absurdly low rates. It’s basically a GDP black hole. 

Imagine a central bank just printed a trillion dollars. A commercial bank borrows it to lend it onwards. A big company borrows it at rates close to 0% and then puts it in literally any market, or just buys back its own shares. That’s just more debt and quite literally 0 output.

Bitcoin is the only reason ""cryptocurrency"" is becoming a household word. Bitcoin is the most accurate measurement of exactly how much the USD is inflating. Bitcoin's liquidity is sucking billions out of the stock market, precious metals, bonds, and traditional savings vehicles into a better system. It's undergone the longest, most persistent stress test of any other cryptocurrency.

A day is coming when Bitcoin has so much liquidity that its price stabilizes, and as much as some people here don't like to admit it, the only way you realistically get a 100 trillion market cap is through greed.

When Bitcoin becomes price stable, when half the world has heard of it and *knows how to use it,* then, and only then, does cryptocurrency become a true global alternative to central banking.

Maybe Bitcoin's fate is to just get wrapped onto the Ethereum network or whatever network becomes the real currency of choice. That's fine.

At the same time these posts were made, 10-15 bear accounts raided the StockTwits message board spreading the same fear in a clearly coordinated and planned attack.

Once the stock found a bottom, buy activity commenced, the bears vanished, and the reddit scam posts were removed.

Reddit was taken advantage of, yet again, by the market makers and hedge funds causing many redditors to sell in panic and lose their money.

I want to provide some counter points to the scam article, to explain a) why I believe this company is not a scam and b) why I believe this company is a solid investment.

Why would a scam company commit publicly to an audit of all financials for uplist to OTCQB - if they in fact were a scam with fraudulent books?

Why is he not out there publicly? They mine in cartel territory in mexico, so leadership and the company wants to remain a bit closed lip to protect the privacy and safety of the team. Additionally, Chinese businesses are notoriously private. Do some DD here and you will see what is going on plain as day.

Corestateholdings is fake or scammers. - NOT TRUE
Really?
https://ptpwallet.com/ looks pretty legit. Ptpwallet is on android and ios.
They run https://cannasos.com/ - looks pretty legit.

I don't see how you can call these guys fake- they looks like a development shop that would be contracted to help a miner launch crpyto. the coin is also proven real.

The coin isn't backed by gold - MISLEADING
In an attempt to be transparent the company has listed the legal disclaimer with the coin - including language that says in effect the coin is not backed by hard assets or credit. This means that you cannot redeem the coin for gold (they won't send it to you) and you can't get FIAT credit for your token from AABB. This doesn't mean though that the currency is not itself backed by gold reserves already mined and to be mined. It just covers the legal stance that AABB isn't going to mail you gold if you buy the token. Seems pretty standard legalese to me. BTW bitcoin doesn't have similar disclosures, would love to see that transparency....

There is more DD we can get into here, but the core arguments made is that this company is a giant scam, and the evidence, corroboration disproves that thesis pretty substantially.

The level of felony conspiracy and coordinated, flawless scam execution across multiple companies, law firms, IR firms, accounting firms with reputation on the line at this stage in the game is laughable if not tactically impossible to pull off.

AABB has money, gold, increasing awareness, and many upcoming catalysts including audit/uplist, coin launch, future mine development, shareholder dividend prospects etc... where they lack in easily accessible transparency is made up in potential for giant gains here.

Turns out, AABB looks as real as it gets in OTC land. Those who invested should do so knowing there is always risk, and do their own DD. Just don't get played so easily.

gotzrab,TheFrozenPyro,71,"Answer: Surprise, it was just stocks all along!

I'm kidding but cryptocurrencies, as they are now, have a system similar to stock markets. While you do something similar to exchanging one currency for another (let's use bitcoin in this instance), you exchange enough money for one bitcoin. You could also exchange the same amount into one company for X amount of stocks. With the bitcoin, you own that coin as money of a different currency to freely do with it as you please; compared to stocks where you just own a small (or large) part of ownership in a company.

The problem is that there's not much that you can do with that bitcoin (or really ANY cryptocurrency), outside of specific groups and companies who will accept it as payment. Setting it into a similar situation with stocks where it's volatile money where it can just be held onto or sold back at some point and get back more, or less, than what you invested into it. So those who are investing in cryptocurrency are hoping that it becomes the next bitcoin where it eventually gains enough traction to rise up in price and make them more than what they put it... like stocks.

goxt5dq,cryptoragstoriches,75,"Here is a birds eye view write up on the project. Ive mentioned it elsewhere but it frankly covers most of the project.

ADAs Differentiators:

Incredibly decentralized and proven mathematically as secure as Bitcoin. By the time March 31st hits the entire network will be fully operated and owned by the community with 100% of all block production being handled by community stake pools.

Fast, robust, built to scale, liquid democracy through on-chain voting, open to all. Allows the entire protocol to be community driven and able to make choices in a more robust manner compared to the industry standard.

The best network stack meta-data implementation in the industry. Extended-UTXO model offers Cardano the ability to run smart contracts safely while maintaining scalability capability.

Hard Fork Combinator technology offers seamless upgrades/hardforks. No obtuse or cumbersome forks with ADA unlike other blockchains who force end users to ""claim"" tokens or coins. This enables fully seamless upgrades.

Built on solid foundations by some of the best people in the industry, who have been working/planning this for over half a decade.  95+ research papers peer reviewed at cryptographic conferences https://iohk.io/en/research/library/ Multiple citations currently in the industry enabling ADA to also benefit from other projects research as they are building off of ADA's existing papers.

Current blockchain labs and partnerships in Tokyo Tech, University of Edinburgh, University of Wyoming,  University of Athens etc. This adds to a healthy educational network that enables further innovation with graduates from these blockchain programs eventually building on ADA.

Largest decentralized PoS network with no downsides to staking and no minimums. You just put it in your wallet and pick a pool. It takes about 3 clicks and you begin to earn ADA. No special hardware or electricity demand needed with no lockup. Your ADA can be moved at anytime.

NATIVE Assets + ERC20 Bridge converter + KEVM. Interoperability done right, nothing like custodial “wrapped assets”. Current ERC-20 projects can migrate over seamlessly and retain their same base code. This will allow their Eth dapps to run faster and cheaper on ADA. DEFI will no longer have the very high fees associated with it.

Native-Assets capable of benefiting from the EUTXO, integration with projects treated as first class citizens, capable of using all of the tools built on ADA without custom integration/smart-contracts.

Developer of the NiPoPow standard - https://nipopows.com/ enabling direct cross chain compatibility with all blockchain projects who adopt it. Will enable direct and decentralized chain-to-chain interoperability without any centralized custodials or middlemen protocols.

All ADA tokens / projects get their own treasury system and voting system built right in for their projects and communities. This is inherent to the system and allows other developers to take advantage of the same benefits as the base ADA protocol does.

Well thought out strategic partnerships, with the goal of providing decentralized finance and blockchain solutions to those who need it the most. Offices located in Ethiopia and operations around the developing world - There was a recently confirmed win found out in an interview with John Oconnor - head of IOHK's African Operations. https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/cardano-iog-reveals-worlds-largest-blockchain-deployment-in-africa/ - More info to follow on this with an Africa Special video from IOHK.

Proven solutions in Supply-chain tracking (Beef-chain) along with PoC's done with New Balance (tracking counterfeit shoes) and Ethiopia (Coffee tracking)

ADA has its own smart-contract language next to the KEVM - Plutus.

ADA will also eventually support legacy programming languages - Python, C++, Java etc.  This will allow future onboarding of current mainstream developers who have not tackled a blockchain project. This is accomplished via the K-framework and is what is enabling the Solidity smart contracts to run.

Plutus smart-contract language has been in development for years by the same people who created Haskell. Useful for any scenario that requires high assurance - Flight systems, Banking networks - perfect for Blockchain / monetary systems.

Built to run a L2 scaling solution called Hydra. This is a layer 2 scaling solution that will allow for unlimited scaling up to (n)  Each stake pool adds 1000 additional tps to the network. At current pool count (1.5K pools) this will allow a theoretical TPS of 1.5 million TPS but will grow with the additional SPO's operating the network. This is currently 15x faster than Vitaliks Eth 2.0 speeds (100,000 tps) This solution does not require security trade offs unlike sharding does but down the road we can shard the base later if we wish and the science pans out. The EUTXO is actually easier to shard than Eth's Account base model.

Sonic: Zero-knowledge snarks in the future.

Multi-oracle Solution - https://cryptoslate.com/how-iohk-will-put-developers-in-charge-of-oracles-on-cardano/: First partner is wolfram alpha - same guys who power siri, amazon echo etc. Developers will be in full control of their choice of oracle and other oracles are able to be onboarded into the framework.

Decentralized voting through the built in wallets, that provides rewards as an incentive to participate and use your voting rights.

Community voting for funding projects from the built in treasury. This incentivizes developers to pitch their idea to the community to receiving funding. System is an inherent venture capital incubator due to this - over 100 million dollars in the ADA treasury to fund developers and entrepreneurs currently. Eth does not have this at all and so is not as self sustaining as ADA.

Decentralized re-useable identity, provided through use of verifiable entities. Atala prism as mentioned in the above article -https://www.atalaprism.io/ This solution runs directly ontop of the Cardano protocol.

277,000+ User delegates

1935+ Nodes/Validators/Pools.

72~% Supply already being staked / delegated already. This lowers liquidity in the open market and also inherently promotes holding coins as opposed to actively trading them. People CAN still move the ADA if they wish but many may choose to just collect the ROI from the rewards as it is risk free.

There are plenty of examples of lazy Bitcoin or Ethereum copy/pastes that have sky high valuations and are adding nothing to the cryptocurrency space. Why always complain about Cardano, which seems to be legitimate and to share many goals with Tezos?

I have a theory that we're in a place somewhat analogous to the 90s dot-com bubble. There is money flowing into cryptocurrency, but most investors simply don't have anywhere near the technical knowledge required to compare the fundamentals of the networks they're investing in. As a result, general hype, who is shouting the loudest, and observed growth of prices in the past, can often be bigger factors than technical assessment. Those blockchains won't necessarily be the winners in the longer term though, just as you can probably barely remember pets.com or boo.com. Several of the current giants that emerged from the dot-com era are companies that weren't widely hyped (or in some cases were even mocked by analysts) at the time.

This denominator is so small and has such an outsize effect on the result that ""all time"" gains are pretty much irrelevant.

If you say BTC is up 44,053 percent over its history, then the first price it must have traded at would be 1/440th of today's price of $47k, or $106. Bitcoin hit $100 for the first time in 2013 and markets were already well established. It had been $1 just a couple years earlier prior to the 2011 bull run to $32. It had traded far below $1 up to that point.

I see Bitcoin's first documented trading price quoted around the internet as $0.0008 in mid-2010 after a year or so of functionality in which there literally was no known price. That would put it at 47000 / 0.0008 * 100 = **5,875,000,000% gain**.

Maybe we use the 10,000 BTC for two Papa John's pizzas transaction as the benchmark for the ""first"" price. What do two such pizzas cost? $30? That would imply a BTC value of $0.003, and gains of ""just"" *1,566,666,666%*.

Copied from another answer of mine:

There's a severe shortage of semiconductors, a vast majority of which are from Taiwan (TSMC is the largest). It's even impacting the automotive industry and the White House is getting involved: https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/01/semiconductor-shortage-halts-auto-factories/

EU is considering the same. 

The reasons for the shortage?

* Pandemic. For a large part of last year the foundries were shut down in Asia. 
* Overwhelming demand due to WFH and people looking for alternative entertainment. That includes phones, laptops (Apple M1 is a huge drag), CPUs, GPUs and yes consoles. These semicondutors are used in a lot of things.
* Prioritization. AMD is prioritizing consoles over the Ryzen or the Radeon chips. Apple bought out tons of time in the foundries so they cannot produce other things.
* The amount of time it takes to create a brand new plant is insane. I've heard anywhere from 1-2 years just to get it up and running.
* Yes bitcoin mining does add to the demand but it's not the only factor.

Bitcoin clearly exists. And it's trading around $50k today. So it's *possible* to make money off it. And there's a non-zero probability of it going up 20x. 

The only factual, logical conclusion is that is does have some sort of value, and it's possible it may appreciate a lot more. So it would be irrational for everyone to allocate zero investment to it. 

&amp;#x200B;

If someone says they're not investing because of their risk appetite, or because they've assessed it and they think it's going to go down, then fair enough. If you're a retiree with a low risk appetite and a portfolio full of bonds, I understand bitcoin isn't for you. 

But I still see people who should know better denying bitcoin completely. Claiming that bitcoin is currently worthless, will always be worthless and there is a 100% chance of loss and 0% chance of any profits for any investor, ever.

gpmju23,btcmarkets_throwaway,111,"Sorry if this is long. To preface, I am 30 years old, high school grad, mainly doing sales in various industries putting me in the “lower income bracket” by most standards, recently married, own no physical assets (car, house, etc.). 

In August 2013 – against all sane advice I read on subreddits like this and others – I put about 95% of my then-modest life savings into bitcoin. 2014-15 killed me as I thought Dec ‘13 was a one-time bubble that would never repeat itself and I should have sold. But I also felt if I couldn’t make money in crypto I would at least be putting my money into a tech I believed in, I continued to buy in small amounts with what I had over the next 2 years. 

Mid 2018 I sold around 5% to cover rent and various expenses, and divested around 10% into alts like ETH and ADA. But other than that, no day trading, just hodling 24/7.

Close to the start of this bull run I became a millionaire, and recently a multi-millionaire. If some of the outlandish predictions come close to reality this year, it’s conceivable I could reach 8-figure net worth. 

And I’ve never felt more scared in my life. I feel like I have no idea what I’m doing on this rocket, and my ticket got mixed up with someone else. I mean I come from an extremely blue collar family, low education, low income, tech illiterate, etc. and here I am in practically another stratosphere financially. Somewhere I’ve never planned to be, nor have any idea how to navigate. 

As I also keep all my funds on hardware wallets  - and even though I’ve carefully done all the recommended security measures - I still feel the incredible weight of the responsibility. I feel like there’s four pallets of cash under my mattress that’s secured with a tiny padlock inside my brain. No one ever talked about this part of “be your own bank.”

I told my wife about it all recently and she’s thrilled, but equally at a loss for what to do with it all. The rest of my family doesn’t know anything about it. 

I mean I’m not asking you guys for financial advice because I know that’s not what this subreddit does. I’m just feeling overwhelmed and wonder if anyone else is in a similar situation. How do you get your head around “being rich” and being comfortable and smart about it? 

I have some plans like maybe going to college and getting a degree, putting a down payment on a house, buying a car, etc. But the rest I have no idea. It’s just insane looking at my net worth (actual and potential) and trying to filter through all the possibilities and decide what to do with it all. And then there’s Saylor talking about not selling at all, just leveraging your holdings to accumulate debt to pay for what you want. Wtf really? 

To be clear, this is not a “boo hoo poor me” comment. I’m excited and happy beyond belief and grateful for being at the stage of starting a family with a nest egg the size of the Hindenburg. It’s just that I’m in way over my head and don’t want to make any mistakes in planning the rest of my life. If I’m smart with this I could take care of my parents, family, kids, grandkids, have my dream job, and make the world a better place maybe. If I’m financially foolhardy I could maybe make a good life for a few years but then have reality hit me in the face when it all runs out. 

And thanks to everyone in this sub for educating me and keeping me sane through all this. I post here every once in a while with my main and it’s really the most mature online place to discuss BTC in my opinion.

gpoleq2,warrior2012,234,"Xlm is a great blockchain and has great technology, but there are still quite a few differences between Nano and Stellar where Nano has the advantage.

We already know about speeds. Nano is a fraction of a second transact time and Stellar takes 3-5 seconds. This isn't a major difference that would be recognized by the average user.

We also already know about the fees. Obviously, nano is feeless and Stellar has a miniscule fee. The stellar fee is set to 0.00001 xlm. This is supposed to be the static fee and never changing. This 1/10000 of a coin also doesn't seem like much to the person sending dozens, hundreds or even thousands of xlm. The people who get left out are people who live in places like Venezuela. That fraction of a coin will be the difference of people being able to afford those fees, especially as the price of the coin goes up, the dollar value of the fee goes up.

Now let's talk about a few things that people don't usually discuss too much while comparing these two coins. First off, Nano is completely in circulation. There will never be another coin minted or created. Stellar has less than 50% of coin cap, actually in circulation (22.5B/50B).

Lets also talk about wallet minimums. With Nano, you can have 1^30 of a Nano (smallest divisible amount) and you can keep moving that as much as you like. See current spam on the network of a user sending the absolute minimum back and forth. https://nanocrawler.cc/ even with this person spamming transactions, there hasn't been any issues or slowdowns. With this spam, Nano handled more transactions yesterday than Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin combined. 

With stellar you need to have a minimum of 1 xlm in the account to open the wallet. You cannot remove that 1 coin ever. I understand the reasoning behind this, but it could be seen as a deterrent to small crypto users as they know they are never going to be use that one coin.

These two coins are very similar in what they try to accomplish. However, go about their solutions in very different ways. I believe that both of these currencies can co-exist, but I personally think that Nano has the edge advantage. Thats my two satoshi worth on this discussion.",2021-03-05 03:46:20

gpps89d,vitaminBTC,130,"You are totally correct, I agree fully. It is not because Bitcoin is appreciating in value that is why it will become the base value holder for the entire future of world commerce. The price appreciation is just the market recognizing over time that Bitcoin is a standalone system outside of the world of central banking and finance capable of final settlement without concern for borders, apolitical and neutral, permissionless and nearly frictionless, open for transactions 24/7/365 and with open markets every second of the day with a bid and an ask in practically every currency pair, free from government manipulation and debasement. (PS did you know that the stock market is open 6.5 hours a day, 5 days a week, or 32.5 hours per week, ie - open only (7x24=168) 32.5/168, just under 20% of the time, not including holidays or circuit breaks. That means every year of Bitcoin trading is actually 5+ years of stock market trading) 

The problem with comparing Bitcoin to the massive list of companies/commodities/currencies that have shot way up before coming crashing back down is, how many of those experienced massive drawdowns, were left for dead, and then they rose again to even higher levels than ever thought possible before? Its crashed, and I mean CRASHED, about a dozen times with 80% or more drawdowns -- curiously though, always at higher lows. And here we are somehow, scraping $50k a coin, 900 Billion dollars worth of value created out of uhhh - a bit of ingenious code and a transparent ledger.

The question you must ask yourself is, why? Why does it not die? It has every reason to! No other example comes to mind of anything coming back from the dead once, let alone multiple times. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin is a protocol layer on top of which the application layer rests. The only comparable example is TCP/IP - otherwise known as, the internet. The internet digitized and democratized information- it is now in the same power as you and I as someone with access to the world's best minds to find out whatever we want at the absolute cost of ZERO. Bitcoin is the digitization of money, it is the democratization of money. Today only the privileged in first world countries can have access to bank accounts, credit cards, checkbooks... To send a wire internationally you can pay $35 and wait a couple of days, that is if the country you are sending to is a country your country is down with and the amount of money does not raise any eyebrows in compliance departments. 

&amp;#x200B;

But we are now in the process of seeing the transformation that will allow any person anywhere the ability to send money unfettered, without questions, without unreasonable fees, nearly instantaneously, from Istanbul to Venezuela if that is where their family members live, on a Saturday, at 11PM, and the person receiving it is not charged extortion fees, or bullied, or marked, or followed, or known to have received any value whatever. 

How much is something like that worth? 

&amp;#x200B;

So in the end if price is all you see, there is a reason for it, it is the iceberg under the surface that you are not seeing, this irresistible, unstoppable force that has been released into the world without hope of curtailing it no matter how much those who control the money supply might try. 

And that is because Bitcoin, without firing a single round and without spilling a drop of blood, has forever placed beyond the reach of man the ability to manipulate and control the money. It is a voluntary system with clearly defined unchangeable rules (21M BTC, Nodes, Proof of Work, Difficulty adjustment, permissionless, non-sovereign, neutral, Supply schedule set in stone for the next hundreds of years) that if you would like to participate in, you are more than welcome to. If you decide you don't like it, you may sell it and leave. And without a CEO, marketing team, or coercion to transact in it as in FIAT, it has made people believe in it to the point of it being today one of the top 15 companies/ commodities/currencies with the highest of market caps, and it is the only one that looks bent on rising the ranks faster than any of the others. And for the first time in its history the macro external outlook has made it look by comparison, FOR THE FIRST TIME, as a desirable place to park value by those with value to park, accumulating enough liquidity to interest public companies. Validation for the thesis subtly embedded in the first block, ambitious and ridiculous in its scope and imagination, PLAYING OUT IN REAL TIME, earning respect in the eyes of the most serious of capital allocators. 

And isn't it interesting that as the price appreciates, it actually becomes more useful and valuable, a better network, more reachable to bigger and bigger entities? It is the world's most fine-tuned positive feedback loop ever witnessed. Created by someone (anonymous of course, how else!) who understood this needed to be a public utility (as in water or electricity) and never cashed in on their deca-Billions! IS YOUR MIND BLOWN YET

Bitcoin is in the envious position of having time on its side. Everything else feels like it is borrowing against the future at ever-steepening costs to attempt to keep the charade going for another day. Short term gain, long term pain. Every decision at a corporate and government level today is made with the short term in mind, without paying a lick of mind to the long term. Bitcoin just mines another block. And another one. Miners keep dedicating to it more hashpower. It gets stronger and more secure. Monetary policy automatically tightens every 210,000 blocks/ approx every 4 years. Price rises. And the loop goes on. 

With this scenario as laid before you, in the long term, how does this all play out from here? 

Bitcoin in the end, is an unalienable right. Like water. Like electricity. Like the internet, arguably. 

because...  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. And that includes freedom of monetary opression. For every human being on the planet, INDISCRIMINATELY, let freedom ring.

Bitcoin (the apple of crypto -blue chip)is the undisputed market cap leader and pioneer in the space-  Mike Novagratz. Bill Miller, John Tudor Jones, Cathie Wood, Mike Saylor are bulls.  Ethereum is the backbone for the defi movement and has actually outperformed bitcoin in 2020 and I believe in 2021.  As for alt coins focused on defi space and long SNX and Chainlink- these are strong alt coins with superior teams and tech behind them.

gq3lbh2,shawnz,1,"&gt; Fiat currency has no intrinsic value in that it is just paper or plastic or coins. But there is the consensual agreenment of value (which bitcoin has)

Agreed.

&gt; ... but on top of that also has an intrinsic value BECAUSE it is regulated. Inflation is kept under control. Money printing or lack thereof is done in order to maintain stability and low volatility. On top of that governments(not perfect) provide safety, insurance as do the banks for fraudulent transactions and stolen money. If I go to the police or any authority they will provide some help.

Agreed, these things are all benefits of using fiat currency for most people. (I think it's debatable whether that is properly called ""intrinsic"" value but that's just semantics).

&gt; Bitcoin has neither of those. The qualities and applications or beauty of it start and end in the digital realm. In the real world it has become a scam and used by criminals mostly.

In certain applications it is exactly BECAUSE it doesn't have any inflation control or reversible transactions that it provides a benefit. You don't always need those properties, and most people might never need them, but sometimes they can be desirable. For example, Argentinians probably never thought they would be needing to escape their government's currency controls 50 years ago. So what will we think 50 years from now? Bitcoin provides a hedge in case the systems we rely on fail in unexpected ways.

&gt; For the sake of simplicity let's say they make an initial coin offering ...

Frankly, I don't love the idea of ""initial coin offerings"". They make it easy to create scams like you describe. Cryptocurrencies which are not pre-mined provide a major advantage in this way: The creators of the coin don't have an incentive to manipulate the price for their own benefit. Bitcoin was not pre-mined and so those kind of arguments don't really apply. Although the anonymous creator ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" did mine many coins for himself while Bitcoin was still relatively unknown, so you might say in that sense even Bitcoin was kind of ""pre-mined"", although those coins have never been moved and it is widely assumed that ""Satoshi"" is dead (it's commonly assumed his identity was actually crypto researcher Hal Finney).

&gt; Acoin starts being traded. News hits, people talk about it, some people make money on it. THIS IS PART OF THE SCAM TO DRAW IN NEW MONEY TO THE GAME. Because if nobody made any money, no one would care. ... It is just like how the government will post pictures and prizes of winners to make people THINK they have a real chance

What you are describing is more like a pump-and-dump scheme than a ponzi scheme. Any asset can fall victim to a pump-and-dump if the volume is low enough for it to be manipulated, it is nothing specific about the asset itself. The ""fix"" for that is to get more speculators into the market, since having more speculators makes it harder to manipulate the price (as you have to compete with the speculators in order to change the price). If you believe that people are mistakenly overvaluing it then it is a great shorting opportunity for you, which will allow you to profit from the people who are mistaken and also close the price gap to prevent future investors from being tricked. To suggest that speculators are just leaving those obvious shorting opportunities on the table doesn't really add up.

&gt;  So how do I even know now that the crypto equivalent of wall street/hedge funds are not or (have not been already) artificially pumping the price up with insider transactions? ... I am sure people who had BB stock and held to sell right before its bubble burst thought they were very smart but really they just got lucky. It is impossible to know what will happen.

Like with any investment, just ignore the hype you read on finance sites and make your own informed decision about the valuation. For example, lots of risky/uninformed speculators got burned during the dot-com bubble. But were people wrong to be excited about web businesses at that time? I am certainly not suggesting you should go remortgage your house so that you can spend it all on Bitcoins -- I am just saying it's an interesting new asset class that is worth considering and might even be worth investing a small percentage of your portfolio.

Maybe you think Bitcoin is useless for you, I think that is pretty typical for most people living in a first-world country with a stable currency that has stood strong for decades. In that situation it is hard to see the advantage of Bitcoin. But not everyone is in that situation and therefore Bitcoin does have value for those people. Like you say we also can't predict the future, and there are many situations that Bitcoin can provide a hedge against, so I don't think it is unreasonable even for westerners to want to hold a small amount of their portfolio in Bitcoin just to account for those tail risks.

&gt; I have a suspicious feeling whoever or whichever group made this knew exactly what they were doing to extract money from the system into the illegal world. 

Fully agree, whoever created Bitcoin was well aware that it would be used to bypass laws. But the same is true of every encryption technology: We don't seriously talk about banning encryption because it lets criminals communicate in secret, so why do we talk about banning Bitcoin because it lets criminals transact in secret?

The US could get rid of the fourth and fifth amendments and it would be easier to catch criminals that way. But it would also be easier for politicians to create overreaching policies that hurt citizens' freedoms. So as a society they have decided that the fourth and fifth amendments are necessary checks and balances even though they make committing crimes easier.

&gt; So to advertise crypto as a safe and reliable investment wouldn't really make sense

Agreed, crypto is not a ""safe and reliable investment"" and it would be wrong to describe it that way. Perhaps in 20-50 years when cryptocurrencies are more understood then maybe it will be considered equally as ""safe and reliable"" as gold (which is still not very ""safe and reliable"").",2021-03-07 23:32:47
gq3l2yo,SheetrockBobby,1,"OK, sounds like you've had some solid returns recently, and precious metals would help stabilize the volatility from Bitcoin.

What do you consider the chances are that your investment thesis, as you've described it, might be wrong? What would have to happen to make this turn out badly? 

It's possible we might agree on the same assessment of the risks that traditional equity-and-bond portfolios inherently have: economic and market cycles, misapplications of fiscal and monetary policy, structural changes in how markets are regulated and work with each other. There may be others, but I'm just naming what I think of off the top of my head. And if I'm understanding you right you're expecting those risks, with the weight of over fifty years of policy decisions taking leading up to a disastrous outcome.

But with the pushback you're getting in the replies, I was just curious about what your plan is if your own portfolio doesn't work out, because many seem to be estimating that the chances of a flaw in the gold/silver/Bitcoin portfolio are higher than the chances of a US debt default.",2021-03-07 23:30:18

* In the past 24 hours the market cap has grown only slightly. 
* Bitcoin leading the charge. Going from 55k to 57k and bouncing around a lot between 56k and 57k
* BTC gaining 1.3% dominance. 
* ETH disappointing its fans by not even hitting 1.9k. Their tears falling on bitcoin's gilded road.
* ATOM was unable to hold its $20.
* XLM shows it can be less stable by moving down some.
* Most alts down from the day before. Some are calling it a dip. The wiser call it sideways movement. 
* FTM's big pump was stopped short and FTM fell down some afterwards.
* VET seems to want to move below 6 cents. 
* BAT showing off again, almost breaking 2018 ATH. 
* Bitcoin gold somehow one of today's gainers. 
* Random person talked about being bullish on BCH.
* Hatred for personal stories is greener than any crypto gains.
* Most still up for the week! 
* Mostly unknown to westerners NEM is this week's biggest top 100 loser with a 25% drop. 
* NEM also biggest loser of the day with 16% down, followed by FTM with 14% down. 
* THETA's fuel is the biggest top 100 gainer of the day with 64% up!
* CHZ biggest top 100 gainer of the week with 189% followed by the fuel with 138% up. 
* Today mental image is the big king solo-stampeding all the alts, destroying their beautiful green dildos and revealing the blood inside.

The move up continued overnight and into this morning.

There was that crazy Ivan last night that scared the crap out of a lot of people.  That was fun to watch.

This morning we continued up the column of Xs and hit the point where we passed the High Pole Warning.  This happens when the price moves up over 4 boxes from break out point.  This is marked with purple highlights.

When we hit a high pole warning, we should be cautious about a reversal and drop down 50% of the column.  This reflects the part where the price has simply gotten ahead of the market.  It doesn’t mean the world is ending.  It doesn’t mean the “bull run” is over.  If you are day trading you should know the stop points on the way down.

If you are swing trading, don’t get worked up until the price does something outside a normal movement.

So here are the prices today:

1.  The price hit a high pole warning.  The current column is 19 boxes high.  The High Pole Warning Reversal target is 8/9 boxes down.  That price would be in the $51400 area.  

2. We hit the first price target at $56,230 box.  The second price target (for the next week in normal stocks, but much sooner in bitcoin.) is $57,360.

3. We already broke out and we are moving in areas without local resistance.

4. The break down would happen down around $46,100.

5. The trend line has not changed.  The trend trade is up 146%.

Expect some short term profit taking from this last run—which is almost at 20%.  Why wouldn’t we expect profit taking.  But the downside is pretty limited at this point.  Nothing out of the ordinary has happened to change that.

Watch out for Crazy Ivans.

For those of you unlearned on Crazy Ivans, watch this:

gqpy74e,HappyGoLuckyBoy,24,"In short, yes you are getting lucky. Everyone is getting lucky. I am 47 and I haven’t seen a bull market like this since the tech revolution. Back then you could throw a dart at a stock and it would make you money. We’re not that far from that today. 

So as far as bitcoin goes it’s just like anything else, and this is a rule passed down from grandfather to father to me to my son and I’m just gonna share it with you because it’s the number one rule of investing as far as I’m concerned:

You cannot time a market.

Sure, you can find a good entry point to stake out a position. And you are right on target buying on a crash while everyone else is scared. That is the first part of a solid strategy. But what you are doing? Jumping In and out and in and out? It’s not a sustainable strategy in the 30 years I have actively been trading. At some point when it stabilizes, and you sell,  it may very well just push further and establish a higher “stability point” from where you sold, and you have lost out on all of that additional gain

 Let’s say bitcoin is at 53,000 and drops to 47,000. You buy, and then when it goes back up to 53k and stabilizes, you sell. The next week it makes a breakout run to 60. You just missed out on that. 

It happens to new investors over and over and over and over and over again. Only when you get up to my age have you seen it happen enough times that you learn to just buy and hold, and timing the market is a sucker play. I read an article recently that said the boomers have figured this out and that’s why they just never sell. Same with the apes over in Wall Street Bets have figured out that holding is the key. 

Thing is, I was you once. And I wasn’t gonna listen to the words some stranger on the Internet said. So I get the feeling you’re gonna stick with your strategy until you get burned. But at some point you will. Either you will buy the dip and it will keep falling. Or you will sell the stabilization and it will keep rising. It’s just a matter of time.

TLDR: Hold",2021-03-13 04:03:12

365 days ago, a majority of people thought Bitcoin was on the brink. I won’t lie, I was beginning to sweat as well. The crypto doomsday clock appeared to be approaching midnight. 

Flash forward 12 months. The daily Bitcoin moves are greater than an entire coin was worth back then. Hedge funds and wealthy elites are snatching up all they can, and the average Joe’s are scrambling for the rest. The days are back wherein this sub is a megaphone of optimism and euphoria permeates the comments. 

If this much change was possible over the last year, imagine what could be in store for the next year.

Monero is the Linux of cryptocurrencies.

Even nowadays, Linux is an operating system that causes fear and shivers to those who don't consider themselves technologically literate. This OS has always had great difficulty in conquering space in the area of personal computers. However, what most people don't know, is that unlike how it was in the past, today most of the digital infrastructure is Linux or Linux-based. Cloud computing, AWS, almost all of it is Linux-based. You use or benefit from Linux without even knowing.

Monero, like Linux, does not have a central entity responsible for marketing and education. Unlike 99% (no exaggeration) of other projects that have been pre-mined or receive some sort of ""reward"" from the miners, Monero does not have virtually infinite funds to buy ads, hire marketing firms, etc. The best example of the antithesis of this situation is Justin Sun with Tron. Seriously, who thinks Tron is really a great project? But Justin Sun manages to be in the spotlight constantly which helps in the promotion of his token. In Linux, the main advertisements in previous decades were produced by RedHat, Suse and IBM. Private companies that had a vested interest in promoting Linux. Not Linux itself, because Linux is just an open-source technology.

Similarly, in the Monero Project we are forced to create decentralized groups that have no money and are not necessarily coordinated to create advertising, education materials and general promotion of the project. It is extremely difficult to compete against massive marketing - but if we have learned anything from Linux, it is that over time superior technology wins.

Every person who believes in Monero has incredible potential to help the project. Create a Twitter account. Create educational materials. Translate them into multiple languages. Buy Monero stickers with a QR Code for the official website. Send emails to online stores and service providers you use, asking them to accept Monero. Help them implement it. Everything helps, and we need YOUR help to make Monero reach more people.

*“Ah but I am against spamming or shilling.”* If you understand why privacy is important, it is no longer a matter of just shilling. Using Bitcoin or another transparent currency can be LITERALLY a matter of life and death, for people who live under authoritarian regimes or find themselves in extraordinary situations. These people depend on others who are promoting and educating about the technology of our beautiful and beloved Monero Project.

With the organic growth of our community and more people effectively participating in efforts to improve the scene, there is no doubt that Monero will follow a similar path to Linux and we will soon be dominant in the market. There will be more transactions by individuals on Monero than on Bitcoin, which is doomed to the fate of having txs only between exchanges and other corporate and government entities. It will be virtually impossible for the average person to transact on-chain when fees cost $1000  or more.

Monero is king and is a currency used today, in real life, by people whose physical security depends solely on the currency being private. Nothing beats that.",2021-03-13 04:34:27

gqqiqiu,Theoretical_Action,7,"&gt;Let’s say bitcoin is at 53,000 and drops to 47,000. You buy, and then when it goes back up to 53k and stabilizes, you sell. The next week it makes a breakout run to 60. You just missed out on that.

To further this analogy for anyone still not convinced let's compare three strategies. The first being the strat where you only time your entry to the market and nothing else. The second two being where you trying to time frequent entries and exits. 

Strat 1) You buy when it drops from 53k to 47k and HODL. Bitcoin rises back to 53k again but it doesn't matter you're HODLing this. Over the next year it has it's ups and downs, none of which concern you, and by end of 2021 it rises to 60k and it stabilizes there for, lets even go so far as to say a few years (unlikely but for purposes of the illustration lets say it does). You cash out here and net yourself 13k in profit. 

Strat 2) You're trying to actively trade bitcoin. You buy the dip at 47k and sell at 53k. The next few weeks you're watching btc like a hawk for more dips. 2 weeks later bitcoin dips to 45k! A bargain! You snatch it up. A month and a half goes by and bitcoin has fallen to 37k. No problem, it'll go back up....it's bitcoin after all, right? Right...? It dips further to 33k and sits there for a month. You start to question your decision. It rises back to 39k and stabilizes there for another 2 months. You decide you'd rather just eat the loss than watch it fall back to 33k and stay there for years! You sell and wipe out your previous 6k profits that you took. 

Strat 3) You're trying to actively trade bitcoin. You buy the dip at 47k and sell at 53k. The next few weeks you're watching btc like a hawk for more dips. 2 weeks later bitcoin dips to 45k! A bargain! You snatch it up. A month and a half goes by and bitcoin has surged to 53k again. You sell and snatch your 8k profits. Bitcoin dips to 47k again and you decide what the hell, it's worked so far. You buy in. It continues dropping to 40k and sits there for months. MONTHS. You question your position again, but decide to hang on. You watch bitcoin fall to 38k. Then 35k. 30k. Can you hang on? Maybe you should sell SOME of your position? Maybe you do, maybe you don't. Lets say eventually you're tired of the stress watching this coin brings and decide you want out. You wait until btc gets all the way back up to 47k and exit breaking even on the last trade. Bitcoin rockets to 60k+ the next week. You've stressed and wasted all this time and effort for a measley 1k gain than you might have gotten over simply HODLing the whole time. 

Point is, not only can you not time the market, you will cause yourself a lot of extra stress trying to. Investing with your hard earned money sometimes really does make you forget how hard earned it was. Tossing 50k into an investment? No problem. Until that 50k is gone and you realize the last year of your life was just completely spent and wasted away on that decision.

It wil be just another fiat currency like any other flawed and failing currency.

I'd expand this point: Board members are herd creatures.

gqyn4xt,Nuclear_rabbit,10,"Let's do some evil math. The last time I saw this headline posted (and much of this comment is copied from what I said there), someone calculated as if teachers were glorified babysitters, and used the figure of $3.25 per student per hour.

Let's be even more severe. A teacher has (let's assume, because we are evil admins) only five class hours a day, the rest is spent on planning.

We will also consider the number of students to be a ""bulk discount."" The prophet of finance, Dave Ramsey, once posted on his blog that bulk buying toilet paper netted a 22.6% discount. And since toilet paper in a pandemic is about the value of a bitcoin, we can model covid-era toilet paper to be the same value as a child on the dark web. Thus, we can use the 22.6% discount when bulk buying children.

We evil admins all know that classrooms only 30 children. There's no way we'd cram 42 in one room ever.

Although the school year differs in some districts, I grew up in one that was only 180 days per year.

So instead of $3.25 per student per hour, we have $2.52 per student per hour times 5 hours a day times 30 students per hour times 180 days per year. That comes to...

$68,040.

gqxunra,Hanzburger,8,"It's such a horrible example and allow me to explain. The argument is that some entity can just buy up a bunch of ETH to control the network. First off, the more they control the more the price would move up and the more expensive the attack becomes as they increase their supply. 

Second, this is no different than some entity putting that money towards buying miners to attack bitcoin. People act like it's more impossible to setup warehouses of miners than 51% ETH. Let's assume the market isn't moved at all, it would cost $100B (50% of market cap). While a 51% mining attack on bitcoin would cost [$720k per hour](https://www.crypto51.app/). Not to mention you'd get to keep attacking the network once you own the mining equipment rather than losing that investment as would happen with Ethereum PoS.

Third, to address their nonsense about spiraling costs of an attack since the security is directly tied to the price of ETH, this isn't very different than how it works with Bitcoin. When the price of bitcoin drops, so does the hashrate, because it's less profitable to mine and not worth it. People shutting off their miners increases your share of the hash rate making the network cheaper to attack, and vice versa in the other direction.

This double speak is all too common where people say something is an issue in another chain and ignore it the other way around. Ethereum PoS will be even more secure than Bitcoin PoW, plain and simple.",2021-03-15 05:37:05

It’s all personal choice but someone with $10,000 of cash after bills could do a ton of things. My school of thought is have 3 months bills (mortgage/rent, cell, food gas, utilities) in liquid cash in your bank account as an emergency fund. Even with what we all believe is the imminent collapse of either the dollar or market crash I still keep this cash in my account and don’t touch it. I want to put it in investments so bad to make me money but I don’t touch it. You don’t know when your car will break down, get laid off, or just need a new *fill in the blank*

gr5pouy,VictorCobra,13,"I just wrote [a new analysis](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/LTCBTC/AINdMwgV-The-LTC-BTC-Conundrum/) on the LTC/BTC pair. It's interesting to me because it seems as if whales are constantly dumping coins on the Bitcoin pair (looking at on-balance volume). Meanwhile, institutions and retail are buying on the USD pair (looking at grayscale and Coinbase). 

If the ratio is to go up, I think it'll come from the USD pair first, and the buying momentum from retail would be enough to break through the sell pressure on the Bitcoin pair. Just some thoughts! 

For some context, I accumulated my first Litecoin in early 2019 at $32, and sold it all for ETH and some other alts near 0.5 on the LTC/ETH ratio. I began accumulating again after selling all my XRP at $0.47 for LTC at $110. Then I doubled my LTC allocation with some ETH at 0.09 on the LTC/ETH ratio. Patiently waiting now.

The current climate for crypto, to me at least, feels different than ever before. Rather than the unabashed mania that washed over the world in 2017, this market feels like a consistent and natural maturation of the crypto sphere. 

Good, bad, or other, huge corporations are buying in to the idea of crypto. Yes, Bitcoin is the main benefactor, currently; however, a rising sea brings everyone up. As fresh capital floods into crypto, confidence builds, projects advance, and values increase. 

I for one think these are the first fledgling steps towards the inevitable future. Will Bitcoin replace the USD? I’d be an fool to give a definitive “yes”, but will Bitcoin, and crypto as a whole, become a legitimate store of value... yes. 

Again, personal opinion here, but I feel as though we in this sub are among the vanguard of the future of finance. I understand that sounds hyperbolic, but I truly believe it. Gigantic corporations are scrambling to invest in Bitcoin, crypto ETFs are springing up everywhere, and we are all exactly where we need to be. All we have to do at this point is wait. The tides have turned, the winds shifted, and we stand ready to hold our coins and tokens as the rest of the world shifts towards us.

Not sure I understand?

Is the question something like - given that some exchanges such as Gemini and Coinbase do not list Monero - what are some other ways that Monero could grow its userbase and price?

If so, a couple thoughts of the top of my head:

* People can buy other coins using fiat on-ramps, then trade them into Monero. So the mechanism exists to get Monero, the main thing is whether or not the organic demand will increase. We don't necessarily need Bitcoin &lt;&gt; Monero atomic swaps to exist.
* Demand could increase a number of ways, including:
   * Education - as more people get introduced to crypto and learn more about it, they may learn the pros and cons of coins like Bitcoin - and see the inherent value in things like privacy and fungibility - leading them to monero.
   * Influencers - Currently Bitcoin has influencers like Anthony Pompliano, Andreas Antonopolous, Jack Dorsey, Michael Saylor etc talking highly of Bitcoin. Monero doesn't really have the same kind of thing - but that could change.
   * Utility - people are gradually learning about digital privacy and the need for it. Monero provides privacy preserving technology, and so it's likely that as privacy online continues to erode, the utility for Monero will increase.",2021-03-18 01:49:27

Just to remind folks, the Fed releases its minutes today.  What you should be looking for is their forecast on the interest rates and predicted rate hikes.  If these move up the stock market will shit a brick.  If they don’t move up, bond market will think them insane, and it will react.

Also look for a decision on SLR limits.  This is the reserve levels that big banks must maintain—and how Treasuries are counted.  Exemptions for both started at the beginning of COVID and are scheduled to expire at the end of March.  An extension wouldn’t have a huge impact.  An unwinding of the rules will inject cash in the market looking for a home.  The problem is that there are not many hospitable places for that cash to go.

So, this afternoon “could” range from a relief rally to absolute shit show.  And this all impacts Bitcoin because of stock prices, margin calls, and people search for yield.

Corinna Kopf actually gets a Doge tattoo after Elon Musk calls her out

After promising to get a Doge tattoo once she reached 50,000 retweets on Twitter, Instagram influencer Corinna Kopf has finally followed through on the challenge after an intervention from Elon Musk.


Social media is a powerful place, and plenty of creators and influencers have left their fate in the hands of thousands of Twitter users in the past, often setting a certain amount of likes or retweets as a goal that decides whether they will have to do a challenge or not.

Back in January Instagram influencer and gamer Corinna Kopf decided that she would get a ‘DogeCoin’ tattoo if she reached 50,000 retweets after it became particularly popular around that time.

DogeCoin is a cryptocurrency inspired by the viral Shiba Inu ‘Doge’ meme, initially introduced back in 2013, but experienced a surge in popularity in 2021.

Corinna appeared to hit her goal relatively early on according to one Twitter user who said, “it hit 50k right at the start and she didn’t do it, she’s only in it for clout,” alongside an image that showed she had reached the goal she suggested.

This was in response to a thread on March 24 where Corinna said if Elon Musk followed her she would buy “one bitcoin.”

That then led to Elon Musk himself replying to the disgruntled Twitter user who called Corinna out for not following through on getting the tattoo, with Elon saying, “you raise a good point haha.”

Elon’s tweet seemed to prompt the influencer to finally get the tattoo, as she revealed in a tweet on March 26, the word ‘Doge’ inked in an unusual place.




Corinna tagged the Tesla CEO in a reply to the tweet, but it’s unclear whether or not he’s seen the new tattoo.

Regardless, he seemed to have been the person to finally convince the star to follow through on her promise, and fans are impressed that she’s actually done it.",2021-03-29 23:39:50

I don't think that the faith you talk of is only about the price of bitcoin going up, it's also a lot to do with preventing your current wealth being diluted down and in that respect it's an awful lot like gold. 

Remember, there is work/energy used to both mine gold and bitcoin, tooling/extraction equipment vs raw processing power/energy consumption, unlike fiat currency that requires very little work to produce.

Proof of Stake is where you can lock in your ATOMs into the protocol (this is simplified) and are rewarded for securing the blockchain with ATOMs. As opposed to Proof of Work where miners use hash rate to compete with each other to discover the next block, securing the network through computational power.

&gt;But it's a sobering thought: betting on BTC is shorting our whole way of life.

What? How? This is such a ridiculous reach but it's nothing new. People were saying things like ""For bitcoin to reach $10,000, we'd all be living in cardboard boxes"" since 2010.

Yes, bitcoin (and even robinhood) for that matter have given people the ability and desire to invest and not just stack cash under their mattress. Bitcoin has literally taught me how to save money. That's a good thing.

The big lie you've been taught your whole life is that consumption has to continue at full speed and that frugality is anti-capitalism. People still act like ""jobs"" is the metric that matters. Yes, people need to have positive direction and motivation to contribute to society. No, that doesn't mean that if someone doesn't have a job, they can't do that. All sorts of jobs are moving to automation. That's a good thing. 40 hour work weeks will be a thing of the past soon, and for many of us, they already are. 

It's going to be an interesting transition to a society where frugality is encouraged, consumption is no longer the fuel that makes the world spin, and we actually have to find ways to keep people engage with society in a positive way without having to work 40 hours a week to barely afford rent at their mom's house. Many people will go into this new world kicking and screaming.

This is what I plan to do and is based on what happened in the past. Holding alts over a bear marketis a very bad idea.

[https://imgur.com/a/ERvGSrZ](https://imgur.com/a/ERvGSrZ)

I haven’t posted for a couple of days because nothing much of note was going on.

Today we continued up the column of Xs from the Low Pole of the weekend.  Today we met the local resistance coming down from the previous column’s high.  This means if we get through this box, we should hit a break out and then onto a new ATH.

Good for us.

At the same time, if we reverse down to $57,361 before moving up we will continue the formation.  That would not be horrible as it extends its width meaning the next move up would be nice.  The next breakdown would suck…on the other hand.

Here are the numbers for the day:

1.  The formation is 9 columns wide.

2. **@ $59,691 we would match the previous three high boxes.**  That would create a solid triple top.  In PnF charting this is actually pretty good.

3. **If we break out, it would be a triple top break out.  That happens at $60,288.**  A Triple Top Break out is a significant positive move and we should see a move into the mid $60’s without a lot of resistance.

4. Local support is way down the line at **$51,400.**

5. The trend line today is still at $19,780.  I think we are safe from a trend reversal today!  

It appears that we are holding the $58,700 level right now.  The PayPal news hasn’t sent us to the moon, but I think it’s keeping us up.  That is good.

So, look at the your breakout spots and get ready for some fun.

(PS:  I took my month end ""harvest"" today.  That is when I cull a percentage of the monthly gain and re-allocated it in my portfolio...and add it my ""truck fund.""  Traditionally, this happens and the price goes up.  This has been the case since October.  If that is not a good solid signal representing the monthly cycles of bitcoin, I don't know what else is!)",2021-03-31 03:05:33

Bitcoin's available supply is going to decrease at a faster rate as options to earn money on bitcoin instead of selling it become safer and more accessible. 

In prior bull runs the only way for a holder to realize gains was to sell X amount of your stack. Some might sell everything in a bull market, some might sell a few percent, but in all cases some amount of held coins would be released back into supply. 

Now with lending programs it is possible to ""cash out"" by putting some percentage of your stack to earn interest, which has the advantage of not reducing your stack or incurring capital gains taxes. Again some might transfer all of their coins to blockfi and others only a few percent, but the overall point is the need to sell coins and release them back into circulation has been reduced and will be further reduced over time. 

What this means is bitcoin will convert from a speculation game where a lot of people invest for timeframes less than 10 years and look for capital appreciation, into an accumulation game where a large number of investors will be primarily interested in acquiring and growing the size of their stack. The impact of this can not be understated since bitcoin is already a scarce asset and this will cause it to become even scarcer.

This reinforces my belief that this epoch will track more closely to the 2012/13 run than the 2017 run.",2021-03-31 06:49:28

I spend about 15 hours per week keeping up on this stuff, because so much money is earned that I see it as a second job, so I might as well share the information.  The article is now about twice as long as before, and it includes details about how the lending industry works in terms of Genesis and more about other companies' actual business models.

With their recent rate cuts, BlockFi is now only recommended for people with less than one bitcoin.  Gemini improved its customer service enough that it is now the preferred borrower for people owning between 1 bitcoin and their limit of $5m, and we recommend Genesis directly for lenders with more than $5m.",2021-03-31 03:28:59
