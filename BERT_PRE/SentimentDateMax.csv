top_kek_top,"|\*| Some late night shower thoughts if you will as to the current state of crypto.....

* The rise of Bitmex is one of the reasons why BTC has become this volatile.  BTC has never been this volatile ever.  It is being shorted and longed on every single piece of new information no matter what.  The degenerate gamblers of Bitmex have turned BTC into an altcoin.   What I mean is that with the leverage these gamblers are addicted to and combined with the FUD and twitter TA traps, whales on Bitmex and other exchanges have turned BTC into a high capped volatile altcoin.  You may be thinking, ""well how can btc be treated like an altcoin by these ppl when even on its worse day it only moves 15&amp;#37; in either direction....."".  Answer: Bitmex leverage.  Those 5\-10&amp;#37; swings at 100x are massive.  And this is happening over and over and over and over.  And will continue to happen unless the flood gates of BTC are opened or permanently closed.    Bitmex may have been around 1 year ago \(not sure\) but it's never had this big of a market impact.  Will not shock me if another 2 Bitmex clones come out later this year with better liquidation rates.  

* The sophistication and the further development of trading bots have ruined altcoins as a result of the above Bitmex BTC manipulating idiots.    The bots we have today are different than 1 year ago and will only get better, cheaper and more idiot friendly in the future.   These bots are reacting not only to BTC price movements from the Bitmex idiots but they are also using twitter scraping keywords such as ""partnership, listing, airdrop, etc..."" and are pumping coins milliseconds after any announcements, and inflating the prices of any of the alts with news.   The news scrapers, I don't mind much but the BTC swing bots are destroying alts.   Think about it.  Right now the only alts that are doing the type of gains we saw in 2017 are on new exchanges \(hadax, etc\) and/or ETH based exchanges \(Idex, etc\).  Both of those types of exchanges don't have anywhere near the level of moronic bots that Binance has.  In fact with Binance's low fees, it easily has the most bots of any exchange I can think of \(not sure about the strictly Asian ones\), since these cheap ass bot owners want to spend as little on fees on the hundreds of transactions their bots take part in every day.  Simply put if your altcoin is strictly on Binance you are royally fucked.  This was evident for anyone that held WTC/VEN/ICX when Binance was the lone exchange at hand \(although whale suppression was also a reason for some of those coins as well.....\).

Moving forward, not sure what to do, started in May 2017, still way, way up, already cashed out my initial 10 fold and still have a good chunk in alts.  But Im thinking about just staying in BTC now and playing days like today, catching the bottom of the alts I like and either flipping on the upcoming recovery days or hodling and DCA'ing only on days like today \(these types of days will prolly be common moving forward\).

I'm thinking maybe if Bitcoin ETFs get announced that will be a big enough catalyst to stop the Bitmex mafia from capitalising on BTC volatility and will clean the bears right out........truth be told no clue about what is true or not......these are just musings late night after a long hard shower......",dz2qedz,769.0,neutral

vbuterin,"You're asking for an investment advice on a forum full of overenthusiastic people who often display a disregard for risk and encourage reckless behavior. There is also a conflict of interest because everyone has skin in the game and must convince themselves and others their decision (irregardless of whether it's sound or not at the time) is never wrong. 

Do you expect people here to say ""no, it's fucking stupid, save your meagre funds to slowly build your financial safety net that will save your ass when some random incident will disrupt your security or goals""? Of course not. They'll say ""Do it, go all in!"". Ask yourself is this the best place to seek sound investment advice? You want to just speculate a bit? It's your money and your loss or win, good luck. You want to invest? Prepare to think critically and do your research. No, asking here to get some bullish hype responses  is not research unless you're just looking for validation in which case you will get it promptly.

What is smart idea? [Reading carefully this post written by /r/bitcoin mod that was stickied during the peak of the hype is a good start.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/) 

What is stupid idea? Asking here if you should blindly speculate on a very volatile asset on the most predatory market on the planet with a history of manipulation and shady actors with substantial portion of your current earnings is a stupid idea.

What you need is to critically exame your goals and your current condition.

1. Do you have a basic financial safety net that will ensure you will be able to handle random disasters when your life shits the bed? If not, build it immediately. I don't care if you have no expenses, live in your parent's basement and they pay for everything. Life can shit the bed at any time, you need to be able to handle random situations with a flick of the fingers. If your situation is more safe you still should have some money for less important FUBARS, if you can, good, this is a first step towards financial safety.

2. Do you have **any** kind of savings that you can pull out in case good opportunities arise? I remember a post some time ago on coinbase subreddit of a mother that lamented and wailed that there was a problem with her coinbase account and transfer of funds and she couldn't withdraw her money quickly because she had all of her savings (lol) on coinbase and there was a flash sale with a laptop she could buy for her children birthday for about a third of a price. Of course coinbase had to shit the bed and she lost excellent opportunity that would save her a lot of money on this goal. The children were devastated and so was she. Don't be like her.
Also people often spend too much on things they want **now** because instant gratification is easy and nice but not save enough to afford things they could buy cheaper at a later time. Or they buy shitty things over and over because they break more often instead of buying one good thing that will last them much longer if they saved. But people don't want to pay more for quality sometimes, it's a mistake. This gives you advantage and saves your money. If you don't have opportunity money (and I don't care what your goal is, whether it's a car, or new printer, or a very nice pair of shoes) you are already losing son. You are losing and you're not even aware of it. Be aware.


5. Do you have any kind of savings that you can lock in for a longer time frame that you don't want to pull out at a moment's notice but you can move them should there be an absolute necessity? I assume not, not at this time of your life. But it's good to have at least some.


If you answered yes for all of those questions however, congratulations, you may have enough financial security to begin investing and maybe even speculating on risky instruments with a portion of your portfolio. Sounds boring? Welcome to investing, you've barely arrived at the starting line, if you didn't answer yes to every one of them you should invest in your financial security ASAP. I don't care you have no expenses, that's even better, build your future from the beggining and you will be better off than your peers that waste their money on newest iphone or some other stupid shit and lament they can't afford really nice things when it really matters. Invest in your financial safety net first, invest in yourself ASAP, then after you're safe and comfy, ready to push a button and snatch a good opportunity at any time you want and you have some nice additional savings (relative really) then you're ready for high seas. And even then you need to spread the risk and diversify. 

But before that, no, it's fucking stupid. Investing isn't about jumping at every promise of getting rich quick. No matter how good the promise may seem. Financial security and investing in yourself will never fail. ",dzk732l,553.0,neutral

wehttam19,"You're in the right place. We like honest questions.

Hate is a strong word. I dislike it. I'll list the reasons.

**Its fans.** Oh man, this shit is like Rick and Morty: a fanbase that makes you want to take an electric drill and jam it into your eyeball rather than be involved with them. Bitcoiners falls into two categories: **mad cultists** and **libertarians.** 

**The mad cultists** are mostly just insane. They will not listen to any criticism of bitcoin. They will not take any flaw seriously. Anytime problem with bitcoin as a currency? ""Its the tech, bruh."" Any problem with blockchain? ""You just don't understand the tech bruh"". Its infuriating, particularly because no one has yet been able to give me a legitimate use case for an actual decentralized blockchain (as opposed to internal, centralized blockchains).

**Libertarians** are the worst. If you're not familiar with libertarian philosophy, [In the most general sense, libertarianism is a political philosophy that affirms the rights of individuals to liberty, to acquire, keep, and exchange their holdings, and considers the protection of individual rights the primary role for the state.](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/) But more specifically, libertarians (particularly of the bitcoin variety, usually ancaps)  believe that taxation is a form of theft, that industry should be unregulated by government, that all regulation should be only what the market does. The poor, etc, are not entitled to any care from the state. Roads, buses, everything would be better if it was private. All around, its just terrible. Bitcoiner libertarians will rail on and on about how terrible banks are, 'destroy the fed,' how an inflationary currency is worse than genocide. However, if you pay careful attention, what almost always emerges is that what they REALLY want is to get rich, to not have to work. Its damn infuriating.

Bitcoin 'investors' also show an extraordinary level of hypocrisy: they claim they want a totally 'unregulated' market place (regulations by government, after all, are terrible for some reason), but the minute something goes wrong, they will advise you to contact your bank, charge back your funds, etc. They rely on the government regulations that they routinely deride, as soon as those regulations are in their favor. It shows you time and again that what they're really trying to do is just get rich.

Furthermore, they are smug about it. Bitcoin is the most arcane and technically opaque system of payment transfer I have ever seen. It is extremely difficult to use and requires a ton of research. If you make one mistake, they will blame you for your loss of money; they will literally blame you when someone steals from you, because you didn't prevent by being tech savvy enough  to anticipate all the ways in which you could be swindled. I'm not a tech person. I rely on other people in the tech field to make things accessible and easy for me to use, while I fulfill other functions. If I were to use bitcoin for even a small transaction, because it is so complicated, I would undoubtedly lose my money and (because there are no regulations) no one would help me and everyone would shrug and say 'sfyl'. Yet they act like this is the future, like people should actually be using it? Come on!

That brings me to the scams. Scams, and scams, and scams every single day! All you see is people being taken to the cleaners, robbed, constant pump and dump groups. And if you hang out on r/bitcoin, you will find people openly talking about the pump and dump groups, about how they know the market is manipulated to hell (by wealthy people, particularly those who control the exchanges). Their goal is just to time their buys right so that they can make money off the manipulation (or to 'hodl' through). Yet people lose money all the time, they get taken advantage of all the time, and no one is held accountable because 'free market, bruh'. And in the same breath, turn around and say this should be mainstream? This grossly manipulated, scam-infested market is fit for mainstream adoption? Are you kidding me? I hate scammers. I hate people who take advantage of others, and that's the whole bitcoin community.

Finally, as others have commented, the environmental waste really grinds my gears.

whyam-i-onreddit,"nahh its kinda hard to explain until you have actually been in the philippines. but this is just one shop with one owner putting his sign board as ""bitcoin"" its common practice to naming shops based on popular products. youll find ""ipad,samsung,apple, alienware"" shops everywhere but all they do is sell food really or its a computer shop for people to play games on. by looking at how small this shop is,  i doubt it even accepts bitcoin.

tldr: while this looks really cool, its really not a big deal adoption wise. (treat it as a billboard advertisement)

Don't fucking Johnn***E***  Test me. 

All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanityÃ¢ÂÂs smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is Ã¢ÂÂeasy,Ã¢ÂÂ think about the all the times youÃ¢ÂÂve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if weÃ¢ÂÂre using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as IÃ¢ÂÂve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so IÃ¢ÂÂm perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if IÃ¢ÂÂve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), youÃ¢ÂÂll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the Ã¢ÂÂfactsÃ¢ÂÂ that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I donÃ¢ÂÂt need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles youÃ¢ÂÂve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, itÃ¢ÂÂs difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not to say I donÃ¢ÂÂt understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when SusanÃ¢ÂÂs chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the EarthÃ¢ÂÂs atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sistersÃ¢ÂÂ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and IÃ¢ÂÂm talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have Ã¢ÂÂdelusions of grandeurÃ¢ÂÂ are due to my being Ã¢ÂÂhighÃ¢ÂÂ or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day. I await the furious fussilade of odious obluquies and belittling bombast in the comments below. Ã¢ÂÂToo long; Did not readÃ¢ÂÂ: Did you really think I would include one of these silly little things at the bottom of my witty wordsmithery? It's not my fault if you can't handle my de trop of definitions or my lexical linguipotence! Get back up there and read it, even if you have to go through it with dictionary in hand.

woollymarmoset,"we had a pretty long bear market

every shorter thinks they are an experienced scalper because they had months and months of being able to make money just by shorting any kind of quick rise.

same way bulls think they are an experienced scalper when they make money in a bull market by buying the dip 

changing your mind set is hard, its human nature to double down when you suddenly start losing money. Its basics psychology.

$6,400 didn't hold? its ok, I'll open another short at $6600 and average down my position. BGD to $7,500? Has to be a fake out, I'll double down again. And on and on and on, until they get to $10,000 and spend the next 2 days without sleep because they have to baby sit their position and pray that $10,000 holds. Then even that goes down, and not only do they lose all the money they made during the bear market, they also lose their original investment. And then you get another /r/buttcoin user who'll tell anyone who'll listen that Bitcoin is an overpriced scam.

Thats why the market doesn't just go up or down. It oscillates to give people like that hope, because when they suddenly see it going down again, they get full of hope, but never close when they are only down 5%, they keep holding hoping to break even. And if breakeven comes, they then continue holding to make a tiny bit more profit.

That's the difference between real traders and gamblers. Real traders know when to cut their losses when the market reverses. Gamblers continue using the same strategy they've been using for months. Like I wrote a week ago, the mindset of the market has changed, thats why I switched from ""short the top"" to ""buy the dip""",e2hcdqg,205.0,neutral

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ETHUSD/n48TGByp-ETHUSD-LONG-Forming-Ascending-and-Symmetrical-Triangle/

That green arrow is supposed to indicate decreasing volume over time, but I think it got messed up while the poster was readjusting the chart. To be honest I am not sure if the symmetrical triangle (the smaller triangle) will form anything, but I believe that the ascending triangle (the bigger triangle) will result in a run up. 

&gt;The ascending triangle pattern represents a period of consolidation during an uptrend, so the volume tends to contract as the pattern develops over time. When the breakout occurs, traders usually look for a significant increase in volume as confirmation of a breakout. The absence of volume during a breakout could lead to a false breakout - or a bull trap. ~https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/ascendingtriangle.asp

Indicators are pointing to at least some major change. MACD is pointing towards bullish, RSI is at a perfect neutral 50, and Bollinger Bands are squeezing which also indicates a major change. 

If y'all want some *fundamental* analysis, ethereum usually trails bitcoin's bull runs, and should run up soon. However, if we see a drop in Bitcoin were probably going to come down to the $420 support level. Honestly, there is no news that really points into any change. The recent announcement by [China that they will be using ethereum to develop China's dream city](https://www.ccn.com/chinas-dream-city-taps-ethereum-dev-studio-consensys-for-blockchain-push/) did absolutely nothing to price, so if anything fundamentals are pointing sideways until Constantinople.

zk2997,"felt like it this was a good time to leave a note. 

I've been a bitcoin user/investor since early 2013 and I've never been more bullish about the long term. 

Traders have been blessed with crypto-volatility, wave after wave of high percentage daily changes. Over time this volatility is likely to decline, at least for cryptos with large market caps, but the volatility is also one of the reasons we're all here. The tradability of this asset class is a key draw. All of those exchange profits are REAL. 

Binance is straight up minting money. That a Goldman-backed Circle bought a post-peak Poloniex for $400M is... a reminder of why major banks will (in the long run) find crypto trading irresistible. If the next major run begins, many big banks want to be ready to rake in the $$$. 

And a similar story with insurance. and institutional custody services. Crypto involves huge premiums relative to standard financial instruments. The pull of profits exerts a predictable force on companies, like an apple falling from a tree, the prospect of profit will draw more and more major insurers and other services into the space. And that requires them to understand crypto a little bit. And I've never known someone who really understood crypto to not be a believer at some level. And this increase in understanding and involvement will lend legitimacy to the core. 

In the interim: Price will go up. and down. and all over the place. 

But long run, bitcoin is a killer option play. The downside is pretty limited, maybe 50-60%. The risk adjusted upside - at this entry point - is way higher than you can get with any traditional investment. even with VC returns. 

So, console yourselves a bit, all of the tears being cried today will help carry our crypto ark to the promiseland of maximum profit.

They failed because people saw through their BS... so they did a study finding **preachers to be ""the most trusted men in 1930s America""**

Acting on this, their efforts then focused on disseminating their message through donations to friendly churches.

Therefore when the price of BTC moves, the price of other cryptocurrencies that mostly trade against BTC naturally move with it.

ripplemesilly,"meh.

I think ""bitcoin"" companies being tech laggards and spending their time adopting yet another altcoin rather than keeping current is a real concern. ... one that even draws question on the competence of regulators (not that we really needed more examples...), since regulated exchanges keep getting approved to add more altcoins when their Bitcoin support isn't even current to Bitcoin circa 2013 (e.g. uncompressed pubkeys, no batching, no segwit, no sending to bc1 addresses).

But breaking backwards compatibility isn't a good way to do it.  I think the message you're sending is ""you should oppose improvements to Bitcoin, because eventually you're going to be _forced_ into using them."".

As an author of [BIP 173](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki) I think BC1 addresses are a good improvement, but not remotely important enough to give people a justifiable basis to oppose future changes.

When we designed segwit we explicitly left out a new address format in part to avoid tying segwit to the ability to send to new addresses, since we knew that it was going to take a long time before wallets and services could uniformly send to them. IIRC, it took something like two years for bc.i to be able to send to p2sh addresses.

Right now it seems many businesses prefer to add altcoins instead of keeping their bitcoin support state of the art because thats what makes them money.  This equation changes if people choose to do business elsewhere, and people can make that choice without breaking compatibility.  Organic customer demand at least lets them stick with a cost/benefit trade-off and make their own decision. And besides, I think the failure to stay current sends a valuable signal about a business' operations that we'd lose by forcing it.

""Each Gartner hype cycle begins with a burst of enthusiasm for the new technology, and the price is bid up by the market participants who are Ã¢ÂÂreachableÃ¢ÂÂ in that iteration. The earliest buyers in a Gartner hype cycle typically have a strong conviction about the transformative nature of the technology they are investing in. Eventually the market reaches a crescendo of enthusiasm as the supply of new participants who can be reached in the cycle is exhausted and the buying becomes dominated by speculators more interested in quick profits than the underlying technology.""

""Following the peak of the hype cycle, prices rapidly drop and the speculative fervor is replaced by despair, public derision and a sense that the technology was not transformative at all. Eventually the price bottoms and forms a plateau where the original investors who had strong conviction are joined by a new cohort who were able to withstand the pain of the crash and who appreciated the importance of the technology.""

""The plateau persists for a prolonged period of time and forms, as Casey calls it, a Ã¢ÂÂstable, boring lowÃ¢ÂÂ. During the plateau, public interest in the technology will dwindle but it will continue to be developed and the collection of strong believers will slowly grow. A new base is then set for the next iteration of the hype cycle as external observers recognize the technology is not going away and that investing in it may not be as risky as it seemed during the crash phase of the cycle. The next iteration of the hype cycle will bring in a much larger set of adopters and be far greater in magnitude.""


""Very few people participating in an iteration of a Gartner hype cycle will correctly anticipate how high prices will go in that cycle. Prices usually reach levels that would seem absurd to most investors at the earliest stages of the cycle. When the cycle ends, a popular cause it typically attributed to the crash by the media. While the stated cause (such as an exchange failure) may be a precipitating event, it is not the fundamental reason for the cycle to end. Gartner hype cycles end because of an exhaustion of market participants reachable in the cycle.""

1. The nature of bitcoin is that it is possible to irrefutably prove, with a digital signature, that you have a certain amount of them. Ivan provided to me proof that he had been holding a large number of bitcoins, and he would tell me which website he would deface moments before he did so. I watched them design and test the trojan before releasing it, and then I saw countless videos and posts of its victims running the software and trying to spam the bogus referral links it generates. He uses the same username within the cult that he had used in our group, and will immediately ban anyone who tries to join with a username of someone in our group. I do not have a shadow of a doubt that the things he has done have actually happened or that it really is these two who have done these things.

**For any new cryptopians looking to get started, the following is the simplest &amp; cheapest way for most people to buy cryptocurrencies** (though it will depend on where in the world you are):

Ã¢ÂÂ

First, set up Coinbase and Binance accounts.

* Coinbase has few coins (BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, ETC, ZRX): If you only want these ones, you don't need Binance too.
* Binance has hundreds of altcoins, but does not accept fiat deposits (yet).

Once you have set up your account(s):

1. Deposit fiat to Coinbase. Bank transfer will be cheaper but slower than debit card, usually.
2. Transfer fiat to Coinbase Pro (free).
3. Place Buy Limit order for Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH) on CB Pro (no fees, but you'll have to wait for the market to fill the order).
4. Withdraw BTC or ETH to Binance (also free).
5. On Binance, use your BTC or ETH to buy as many shitcoins as you can lay your filthy little mitts on!

Ã¢ÂÂ

**Remember:**

* Always do your own research. View all information regarding crypto with a critical eye, and make your own, informed decisions.
* Don't invest more than you are willing to lose.

xboarder,"re Tether FUD. 

I think people may be missing an essential factor in the analysis: Core Tether stakeholders are very wealthy folks. Not just from Tether. They were deeply embedded early crypto folk - they've likely got big money from Bitfinex, from Tether (it's almost certainly a very profitable business) and from their personal crypto holdings (the drop from $20k to $6k means very little to a person who started a bitcoin _business_ in 2012 - unless they totally fucked up absolutely everything, they're set for life just on their bitcoin holding). 

Point being: these stakeholders - the group of individuals and orgs that own Tether - have too much to lose by Tether being a fraud. 

Worst case imo: The billions backing Tether are really there. but some regulatory slaps on the wrist may be coming.

But this story is analogous to big banks, when you are making _so much fucking money_ you just start pricing in $100M fines as a cost of doing business. and you are thrilled to be able to continue operating and raking that money in. 

Big banks are obv a master of this. 

The idea that Tether is some kind of Madoff level ponzi is 5 std deviations away from reality imo. The basic incentives of everyone involved just don't point to that kind of ponzi. 

And when I say everyone, I include all the regulatory agencies that are investigating Tether. If this were a total shitshow, they'd have shut it down ages ago. 

So... this Tether FUD sideshow should, at least by all reasonable folk, be permanently put to bed. Even more so now that we've got half a dozen stablecoins sprinkled across the regulatory continuum - from fully above board (Cirlce/Gemini) to decentralized (Maker). 

And beyond Tether ponzi FUD. I think it's worth addressing stablecoin hate. 

People who uniformly demonize stablecoins are missing something absolutely essential about the promise of crypto-assets. We are at the most nascent stages of developing tether-crypto assets. But this trend is massively important. 

The ability to tie a decentralized crypto asset to an equity, to a debt instrument, to _any_ financial instrument. and to even go beyond traditional financial instruments - a stablecoin that tracks not just the _price_ of something, but a coin that tracks anything that's objectively measurable in the real world. 

That is a revolution. 

No doubt it takes some vision to see why this is so. But it opens up an entire new universe of economic/social activity - it requires us to stretch our imagination in ways that few people are capable of. But when you see it, the power of the vision is like seeing the face of god. 

To close: 
(1) Tether FUD is almost certainly overstated. 
(2) stablecoins represent the beginning of our ability to link crypto-assets to crypto-exogenous events. And that is a very big deal imo.

I know I'm sporting a bear flair right now, but at my core, I'm a Bitcoin bull. I think most people here are, and I think our reasoning for being so is incredibly sound.


Ever since the 2008 financial crisis, world markets have been running through no man's land - a time of unprecedented central bank intervention. The reasoning was simple - the credit freeze spooked the fuck out of every business the world over, and made them paranoid and extremely risk-averse. To combat this, the Fed injected tons of money into the market ecosystem via TARP and the various QEs, intending to make the market environment seem safer and convince businesses to take on greater risks (risk-taking, of course, being the engine of economic growth). On the surface, this worked brilliantly. We've experienced a precedent-shattering bull market, unemployment rates reached historic lows, etc. But if you dig a little deeper, I think this intervention actually completely and utterly failed. Let's analyze what has ACTUALLY happened in major markets over the last ten years. Businesses, still shell-shocked from 2008, seem to have taken safe and easy routes to make money post-2008 - via things like stock buybacks, M&amp;A consolidation activity, etc. Companies were able to buy the outward signs of growth in the easy-money, zero interest rate economy, boosting their share prices easily while not taking on much risk at all. In this way, Fed policy failed - it did generate nominal returns as stock prices went up, but risk-taking behavior actually seems to have gone DOWN. Capital seeking greater returns than the passive growth of the whole economy was forced to look for bigger returns by chasing tech startups, real estate, and riskier niche assets like crypto. There was more money chasing big returns than there were things actually worth those big returns, which left us with wonders like [Juicero, the venture-backed wi-fi juicer company](https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/1/16243356/juicero-shut-down-lay-off-refund), the [California housing crisis](https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/qvmgem/california-has-a-hidden-homelessness-crisis), and [utterly useless, exit-scamming shitcoins like Oyster Pearl](https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/new-crypto-exit-scam-sees-oyster-pearl-developer-create-more-prl-tokens-to-sell-immediately/), respectively. Right now that very same risk-seeking capital is LOVING weed stocks, which are in the process of topping out right now, so check out /r/weedstocks for some cheap laughs. **TL;DR: The Fed's low interest rate policies did not create sustainable risk taking or long term growth. They just fueled market consolidation via balance sheets getting bigger, and sent capital on the fringes into weird corners of world markets, where it inflated all kinds of fun bubbles (crypto included).**


Now, the Fed is raising rates, the ECB is playing chicken with Italy, and the US &amp; China are engaged in a pissing contest over balance of trade. Each of these three are all spooky things that could cause a recession. As we watch US equities markets correct, any one of these dams could burst and become the catalyst that brings markets down. Rate raises could easily kill off some of the US's ""flagship"" companies - [Sears recently filed for bankruptcy](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/15/business/sears-bankruptcy/index.html) and [GE is looking dangerously close too](https://wolfstreet.com/2018/11/02/what-general-electric-does-to-avoid-question-when-will-ge-file-for-bankruptcy/). In Europe, the populist [Matteo government is threatening a repeat of the 2012 Greece crisis](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/italy-eurozone-debt-new-budget-matteo-salvini-five-star-a8566671.html) - but Italy is in a LOT stronger position than Greece ever was, making the outcome possibly dangerous enough to the Eurozone to spark an international crisis. Add the specter of Brexit and the really [shaky foundations of Deutsche Bank](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/967943/deutsche-bank-latest-s-p-global-ratings-Germany-shares-crisis) to the mix, and you have a tinderbox waiting for a match. And don't even get me started on the [US v China trade war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_China%E2%80%93United_States_trade_war) - imagine the absolute chaos that would happen if the PRC manipulated the yuan in an ""unfriendly"" direction. The Chinese government is a *real* whale with *real* power, and they could dump their US Treasuries too to add insult to injury and ruin one of the biggest safe haven assets the world financial system depends on. **TL;DR: There are three really big, somewhat probable ""catalyst"" events that could send world markets into a nosedive.**


The really insidious thing about all of this is that the central bank emperor no longer has any clothes. If unprecedented intervention doesn't prevent the next crisis (or worse, creates an even NASTIER crisis than 2008), it's quite possible that the faith in central banking as a cure-all for crises will be shaken or totally undermined. I'm of the opinion that all that injected capital didn't make our markets stronger - it just subsidized risk-averse behavior and didn't adequately penalize companies for their lack of risk taking. It created paper growth (inflation) and not real growth. Laughably, it also subsidized the creation of [never-profitable behemoth companies like Uber](https://www.reuters.com/article/uber-results/uber-narrows-loss-but-still-a-long-way-from-profitability-idUSL1N1V611I), so it'll be interesting to see how those companies end up in a time of crisis. **TL;DR: The Fed [inflated the USD roughly 17% over the period 2008-2018](http://www.in2013dollars.com/2008-dollars-in-2018?amount=1), for minimal (if any) gains in market strength.**


And that's where Bitcoin comes in.


When the markets finally do get rekt after their 10+ year artificial inflationary orgy, it's *possible* that people will wake up to the fact that we live in inflationland. The illusion of stability and safety will be shattered once again, as will the illusion that central banks can do anything to control or ""tame"" the inherent wildness of markets. Consequently, it's possible that people will lose faith in the greenback as the *de facto* global arbiter of value in this scenario. It's not going to be easy to watch paper ETF gains melt away while companies nominally beat earnings, or watch long term bond holdings start trading way below par. The defeat of the ""central banks are all-powerful"" narrative will send shockwaves through global markets, which will realize that *no one is in control*. Bitcoiners have been adjusting to the realities of a system where no one is in control for some time now, so they'll have a head start. **TL;DR: When markets get rekt, everyone will realize that central banks are just whales, after all. They make waves, but they don't make the ocean.**


Bitcoin (and probably a handful of other non-inflationary cryptos) will benefit the most from this scenario if it happens. An inflationary world where no major currency can be trusted to hold its value long-term will send money scrambling for things with fixed or limited supplies. Precious metals and other commodities will probably also benefit in this environment, as people re-configure their investments to be as close to tangible assets and cash flows as possible. The tail risk of being financially ruined in an inflationary world is worth hedging against, and remains my dominant reason for holding 10% of my net worth in crypto at this time. I assume many of you folks believe the same.


**Whether you're here to hedge against the inflationpocalypse or just to get rich, I wish you all the best of luck in acquiring as many BTC as possible. It's a long road ahead.**

u/omise_go u/nebali that surely is a nice list of things done.

Inspite of some negatives there actually are many positives. As we have criticized the team for the negatives, we must appreciate them for the positives.

Taking our criticisms and suggestions, the team has striven to improve. They have taken many insults, threats to life and yet continue to strive. There have been weekly updates, weekly AMA's, Community Updates almost monthly in recent times, they have an Internal Testnet and we saw/played Plasma Dog. Kudos for all of that.

Blockchains were in the works from the 90's but only private chains were possible. It's only in 2009 with the Bitcoin whitepaper that Public Blockchains became possible. From 2009 till 2018, public blockchains have had the time to iteratively improve. Lightning Network and Raiden have been working on payment channels for more than 3 years and are yet to release fully.
Layer2 based Plasma had it's first spec in Jan 2018 and inspite of the complexities related to security and UX we are inching close to a public testnet within a year. It would be good if we can consider and appreciate this.

A simple timeline

. Plasma MVP Spec out in Jan 2018

. Q1 2018 - Plasma MVP prototype code done and release

. Q2 2018 - Plasma MVP had bad UX so research was done to produce More VP, Fast Withdrawals, Fast Withdrawals for faulty chains and Fast finality

. Q3 2018 - First production version of OMG Network based on Tesuji design that produced an internal testnet.(Production releases are beasts as you have to get all details right regarding business parameters, security, performance, etc.)

. Q4 2018 - First round of formal verification, Plasma Dog based internal testnet, Production version to use More VP and towards a public testnet. There is quite a decent amount of GitHub commits to Elixir-Omg.

Sure there have been negatives in the past, but for all our sakes, it's time to let go of the past and move forward.

This has happened in the past when a major exchange went under. There is zero protection for BTC balances, because noone can print BTC to bail you out.

I highly recommend getting a hardware wallet, and withdrawing your BTC from the exchange. Until you do that, you own 0 BTC and an unbacked receipt for *maybe 10 BTC*.

wookiesvendetta,"Ã¢ÂÂIf You Build It, They Will ComeÃ¢ÂÂ: An Open Letter to the Artifact Community

Ã¢ÂÂ

Ah, a classic test of narcissism: who is the Ã¢ÂÂyouÃ¢ÂÂ in that statement? Is it Valve? They built a game. It seems good to great to me. Artifact is certainly a better value than most of games IÃ¢ÂÂve paid $20 for in my Steam library. Still, the game is lacking features the player base sorely wants and subsequently has suffered a precipitous drop in user base. A lack of meaningful ranking system hamstrings those seeking to be Artifact professionals and turns away even casuals who just want to see how they compare.

Now, consider: is the Ã¢ÂÂyouÃ¢ÂÂ, well, you? DonÃ¢ÂÂt we as a community have some role in establishing a competitive scene or ranking system? Dota and Counter-Strike are legendary in the esports scene. I played CS and DoD when they were still just HL2 mods. The competitive scene did not just get handed to us. Ranked mode wasn't even a concept that existed inside video games beyond arcade leaderboards. It took people like Clinton Ã¢ÂÂFearÃ¢ÂÂ Loomis, grinding away at some shitty desk for years, knowing that one day Dota was going to be a thing. It took people like JarosÃÂaw ""pashaBiceps"" JarzÃÂbkowski giving up Ã¢ÂÂregularÃ¢ÂÂ work, believing he could support his family by one day competing in Counter-Strike.

These kinds of people are out there in Artifact, grinding away right now. Players were putting themselves out there on Twitch on Christmas Day because they love the game and canÃ¢ÂÂt get enough. I know. IÃ¢ÂÂve seen them, even talked to some of them. There are great players and personalities out there who want to compete at this game of cards we all find so irresistible. Yet, when they open the game client to do so, all they can really do is compete at how many hours they have grinded through the skill rating system, if it can be called a system. The social tab is painfully empty. It feels like a giant competition with players from all over the world and a giant venue but the organizers did not spend any time or money organizing the actual event.

We, you, need to build the community if we want to see our own great esports events and competitive scene. Liquid canÃ¢ÂÂt do it if no one else is trying to do it too. We all need to get shaking and moving together if we want a deep community to thrive and be an exciting scene. Otherwise I suspect the few Artifact interest groups that exist right now will wither away while we wait for Valve to Ã¢ÂÂfixÃ¢ÂÂ a game that is fundamentally sound.

If you are an aspiring pro, keep on playing, the work will show.

If you are a Twitch viewer/donator, consider visiting medium or small Artifact-focused streams.

If you love the game, ignore the haters. It is a brand new year, carpe diem!

I would like to take a moment to commend Stancifka for carrying on the competitive spirit of all sports by putting his money on the line. He is the greatest Artifact player right now. Do you think you are better than him? Prove it, go take his money.

universemasterthrowa,"what does making it ""simpler"" actually mean? 

From what i understand, some computations have 3 main bottlenecks - processor dependence, memory dependence and storage dependence. Processor dependent operations perform most of the calculations inside the processor. memory dependent operations are partly calculated inside the processor, but in order to complete the operation, they have to keep reading information from the computer's memory, to the point where improving the processing speed doesn't make much difference. ultimately, transfer speed between the processor and the memory has more impact. storage dependent operations are similar to memory dependent, but the information is taken from the hard drive, onto the memory and then into the processor.

An ASIC is basically a bunch of processors soldered onto a single circuit board. they can perform millions of processor dependent operations simultaneously. ASIC resistant cryptos (often referred to as memory-bound proof-of-work) increase the amount of data that needs to be created in order to solve a block to the point where the processor alone cannot solve it, forcing it to put data into the memory, e.g. litecoin requires 128kb of memory, monero requires 2mb, aeon requires 1mb ethereum requires 1gb etc.However, his doesn't always work, as some manufacturers have worked out how to ASIC litecoin and previously monero. Bitcoin uses a processor-bound proof-of-work. There is also storage-bound proof-of-work, which is basically proof-of-capacity

simply switching to SHA128 doesn't really change anything, SHA-3 is more energy efficient than SHA-256 and more secure than SHA-128. the reason ASICs dominate mining is not down to simplicity, but instead down to how one ASIC can produce as many computations as several thousand GPUs, making financially unfeasible for anything other than ASICs. Once the amount of hashpower of all people involved in mining reaches a certain level, it becomes almost impossible to mine a block on anything other than thousands of dollars of mining equipment as mining is a competitive process and the benefit of mining power of a regular computer is neglible.",edn4e7e,1.0,neutral

timetravelinteleport,"both. Someone must spend for someone else to accumulate.

The ground truth is the price; its the only number which illustrates the real balance between the demand for savings vs spending in btc.  The reality is that the price at which sufficient people will spend to meet the demand of those who want to save is around ~4000 usd worth per btc. That is about the amount of value to cover 1 year of eating at restaurants for the average middle aged american.

These technical indicators are positive for the health of the network, but they dont prove anything about if or when the price of bitcoin will go up. More realistically, the price of the dollar going down will push the value of bitcoin up. Ultimately, the dollar as we know it today must devalue or die, so this is somewhat inevitable. Hard to say when , but probably later than we think.

xpvwws,"nullc / Greg Maxwell:

Are you the same nullc described in the article ""Evidence that the mods of /r/Bitcoin may have been involved with the hacking and vote manipulation ""attack"" on /r/Bitcoin.""?

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7eil12/evidence_that_the_mods_of_rbitcoin_may_have_been/

&gt; We believe that it is likely that /u/4n4n4 aka /u/nullc was also aware of or involved in this attack based upon the suspicious timing and similarities of [CU-2]. 

&gt; So who posted that?

&gt; We have a surprisingly large amount of evidence indicating that 4n4n4 is /u/nullc, the CTO of Blockstream.
The biggest indicator we found is that nullc has the very frequent pattern-- of writing--his sentences with two dashes separating words. This by itself is somewhat rare, though we confirmed that he uses it more times than anyone else in the CN database, the much more unusual habit is using two dashes with no spaces on either side. The CN database stored 860,000 comments for us to compare with, and very quickly confirmed the similarities between the two. His history is littered with examples, but we also used the bitcoin-dev email list to confirm the unusual habit. Like 4n4n4, nullc also has examples of using this--specific pattern twice in one sentence, which was extremely rare in our searches.
But there were many more things we noticed. We found several examples of 4n4n4 picking up nullc's conversations and continuing them. One such case was 4n4n4's third comment ever. 4n4n4 also referenced many of nullc's writings and posts. 4n4n4 referenced this code change that originated from nullc multiple times. 4n4n4's [CU-2] comment edit used the words ""rbtc playbook,"" something our database confirmed was extremely rare but is a saying nullc likes.
And that was just the beginning:
	1	Very knowledgable about Bitcoin Core development &amp; the history of the scaling conflict.
	2	4n4n4 picked up a thread after many replies by nullc arguing that low fees and empty mempools are actually a problem.
	3	Just like nullc, 4n4n4 liked BIP148 but did not ""support"" or ""endorse"" it.
	4	Seems to know an awful lot about nullc's life.
	5	Used the phrase ""Bitcoin's creator"", a major nullc trait previously documented
	6	Talks about nullc. A lot.
	7	Somehow knows who is working on what within Blockstream.
	8	And even responded directly to nullc in support of a claim nullc had made multiple times within that thread

whuttheeperson,"thank you so much for reaching out! I think your input would be extremely helpful--basically, I am just trying to paint a good picture of what bitcoin miners do. The questions I have are:
--How did you first get involved in bitcoin mining and why? Also curious to know more about how long you were a miner and why you quit.
--For you, was bitcoin mining essentially your primary job, a secondary job, or a hobby?
--How many hours per week on average did you devote to mining, and where did you like to do this work?
--Would you describe the process of mining in your own words?
--IÃ¢ÂÂve heard that many bitcoin miners go out of their way to keep their identities a secret, for privacy reasons. Is this true/is that something you tried to do, as well? If so, why would you say it is important to protect your privacy as a miner?
--What would you say was your Ã¢ÂÂgoalÃ¢ÂÂ as a miner? Was it just something you liked to do, was it purely to accumulate more bitcoin, etc.?

unstoppable-cash,"Ã¢ÂÂA shipping container in a remote corner of a Canadian oil field is churning out an unlikely byproduct: bitcoin.

Inside the container, high-powered computers generating new units of the cryptocurrency run with hardly any human supervision; they just need powerÃ¢ÂÂlots of it.

In what seems a perfect marriage of supply and demand, that power is coming from natural gas with nowhere to go.


Power Couple
Natural gas has become nearly free in parts of NorthAmerica, making it appealing for the mining of bitcoin,which also has lost value.

Natural-gas prices have cratered over the past few years. The market is awash in the stuff, to the point where some North American producers are setting it on fire or paying people to take it away. In some parts of Texas, natural gas is now going for less than nothing for the first time on record. More companies are now looking at productive ways to use the natural gas right at the source.

The container sits next to an oil well owned by Black Pearl Resources Inc., near the town of Marwayne, Alberta (population around 600). Black Pearl is getting a good price for its crude these days. But for all the oil the site pumps, it also pulls natural gas out of the ground, which presents a problem.

Hauling it away to sell it isnÃ¢ÂÂt economically viable for a location this remote, and it canÃ¢ÂÂt just dump it either. Local governments in places like Alberta have limits on how much natural gas companies can burn or release in the airÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂflareÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂventÃ¢ÂÂ in oil field lingo. When that level is reached, producers may be forced to shut down oil wells to avoid a buildup of natural gas.

That has turned at least one traditional oilman into a bitcoin entrepreneur. Stephen Barbour, a consultant who helps lower costs for oil field companies, last year set up the 20-foot-wide container to mine bitcoin, with a power plant attached to convert natural gas into electricity.

Stephen Barbour set up shop in the container last year.

Ã¢ÂÂI knew about all the wasted energy that goes on,Ã¢ÂÂ says Mr. Barbour, who until a few years ago worked as a mechanical engineer for an oil company. Ã¢ÂÂReading about bitcoin mining and how it could monetize energy through the internet, I just thought that was unbelievable,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.

Ryan Wartman, a production foreman for Black Pearl Resources, said that channeling about 400 cubic meters of natural gas a day to the bitcoin-mining rigs in Mr. BarbourÃ¢ÂÂs container helps keep the wells operating 24 hours a day.


Ã¢ÂÂIt was the best option for us,Ã¢ÂÂ said Mr. Wartman. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre using it to bring ourselves below the government-regulated amount that we can vent on location and keep producing oil.Ã¢ÂÂ

Because bitcoin mining -- a process of solving complex equations to Ã¢ÂÂmakeÃ¢ÂÂ new units of the virtual currency and earn transaction fees -- is so electricity-intensive, much of it is done in remote, chilly areas with cheap power, such as windswept parts of northwestern China. When bitcoin prices exploded in 2017, mining in North America also took off.

As the digital currencyÃ¢ÂÂs value has plunged over the past year, inexpensive electricity has become even more crucial for miners.

Lightspeed Hosting, which runs data centers for bitcoin mining and other uses, is building a new facility in Akron, Ohio. Chief Executive Joshua Holmes said one way to cut down on electricity costs could be to build a generator and take in cheap natural gas from Appalachia, another region with more natural gas than producers know what to do with.

This year, Lightspeed has also started submerging some mining machines in mineral oil to cool them, another way to keep energy costs down.

ItÃ¢ÂÂs hard to keep costs any lower than in Mr. BarbourÃ¢ÂÂs shipping container. Ã¢ÂÂI know for a fact that I have the lowest operating cost on the planet,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂBut the other side of that is the capital cost.Ã¢ÂÂ

Natural gas that would otherwise be disposed of powers the bitcoin-mining operation.

Buying and outfitting one shipping container to handle the high power consumption can run anywhere from $45,000 to $130,000 even before installing the bitcoin-mining equipment.

For others, such an investment just hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been worth it.


Dave Perrill, which powers bitcoin mining in data centers in South Dakota and Texas, said he has had to pass up offers to team up with natural-gas producers and landowners in the Permian Basin because of the infrastructure costs involved. Ã¢ÂÂIt wasnÃ¢ÂÂt economical for us to make it work,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.

The digital currency has traded near $4,000 recently, down from a high of more than $19,000 in late 2017. Mr. Perrill said bitcoin prices would have to exceed $5,000 at the current level of mining difficulty for him to consider taking on excess natural gas from the Permian. (The computing power required to create each new bitcoin has increased over the years as more miners compete to create coinsÃ¢ÂÂand the number of coins are finite.)

Others set the break-even benchmark much higher. Last year, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Jean Ann Salisbury estimated that using free natural gas would only become profitable if bitcoin prices averaged $18,788 over the next 15 years, based on initial costs of about $700,000 for the power plant, $100,000 a year in operating costs and increasing mining difficulty as time goes on.

For now, Mr. Barbour is holding on to the cryptocurrency that he creates in Alberta, only selling bitcoin when he needs to cover operating costs.

In addition to his container on Black PearlÃ¢ÂÂs oil field, he has built and sold two other units. He is working on his fourth for a team in Texas that was drilling for oil but found only natural gas.

But he has struggled to get oil-industry veterans interested in mining cryptocurrencies. In September, he showcased a rough version of his mining container at an oil show in Lloydminster, a city on the Alberta and Saskatchewan border, to a bewildered crowd.

For a net credit of 10kwh .   That Type of thing.  Usually when they credit you they will do so at a fraction of the price they charge you for going over (only 10% for me).

Going through his post history you got gems like this 

&gt;I have seen you make a similar post within /r/apple at least once before. Apple products are luxury goods for individuals with high incomes. $1800 is not a lot of money to many of us. Whether I buy a $500 laptop, a $1800 laptop, or a $5000 laptop makes no difference to me financially.

&gt;If this is a testament to how you spend your time there is no need to wonder why you are poor. You too probably do not understand why someone would buy a luxury car, clothing, or home. You lack sophistication and culture so you rage with jealousy and envy on the internet about things you don't understand.

[link](http://np.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1hzivf/what_changes_have_you_noticed_in_mavericks_beta_3/cazo069)

and

&gt;Apple laptops are not by any means the most expensive computer someone can ""come across."" I also own an Asus G75VW-DH72 and a variety of other computers that I have purchased over the years. &gt;**Again, you are obviously poor.**

&gt;You are right, I do not have the same concept of money as you. Whether or not I am purchasing a Apple laptop or a Mercedes makes no difference to my quality of life nor does it alter my financial state.
Would you consider someone foolish for spending $1.99 on a pack of gum instead of the cheaper .99 option? Your concept of money is one of a poor persons. You have an inflated view of $1000 that many of us do not have.

&gt;If it makes you feel better I can send you an old Apple product collecting dust in my closet. You seem to be the type of person that is poor from lack of education and drive rather than an unfortunate circumstance so you may not deserve it but that is okay.

xBram,"Ã¢ÂÂAfter I arrived, I was ushered into what I thought was the green room. But instead of being wired with a microphone or taken to a stage, I just sat there at a plain round table as my audience was brought to me: five super-wealthy guys Ã¢ÂÂ yes, all men Ã¢ÂÂ from the upper echelon of the hedge fund world. After a bit of small talk, I realized they had no interest in the information I had prepared about the future of technology. They had come with questions of their own.

They started out innocuously enough. Ethereum or bitcoin? Is quantum computing a real thing? Slowly but surely, however, they edged into their real topics of concern.

Which region will be less impacted by the coming climate crisis: New Zealand or Alaska? Is Google really building Ray Kurzweil a home for his brain, and will his consciousness live through the transition, or will it die and be reborn as a whole new one? Finally, the CEO of a brokerage house explained that he had nearly completed building his own underground bunker system and asked, Ã¢ÂÂHow do I maintain authority over my security force after the event?Ã¢ÂÂ

For all their wealth and power, they donÃ¢ÂÂt believe they can affect the future.

The Event. That was their euphemism for the environmental collapse, social unrest, nuclear explosion, unstoppable virus, or Mr. Robot hack that takes everything down.

This single question occupied us for the rest of the hour. They knew armed guards would be required to protect their compounds from the angry mobs. But how would they pay the guards once money was worthless? What would stop the guards from choosing their own leader? The billionaires considered using special combination locks on the food supply that only they knew. Or making guards wear disciplinary collars of some kind in return for their survival. Or maybe building robots to serve as guards and workers Ã¢ÂÂ if that technology could be developed in time.
ThatÃ¢ÂÂs when it hit me: At least as far as these gentlemen were concerned, this was a talk about the future of technology. Taking their cue from Elon Musk colonizing Mars, Peter Thiel reversing the aging process, or Sam Altman and Ray Kurzweil uploading their minds into supercomputers, they were preparing for a digital future that had a whole lot less to do with making the world a better place than it did with transcending the human condition altogether and insulating themselves from a very real and present danger of climate change, rising sea levels, mass migrations, global pandemics, nativist panic, and resource depletion. For them, the future of technology is really about just one thing: escape.Ã¢ÂÂ

qchisq,"kinda attractive, but prices like these for gpus really bring me back to just a few years ago when they first announced the nvidia titan and it was holding up to the name of being a beast of a gpu, a special luxury to have when you do tasks beyond only gaming, it was a grand and it was considered a lot, money that you would only spend if youre serious enough.

Years later more titans were announced, and the second biggest thing that distinguished themselves from your typical high end consumer gpu is that they were so expensive that you must be a madman to spend a grand on a gpu.

Thats at least all under my point of view,   
And now your typical high end gpu is as expensive as the titan series, if anything, far more expensive.

And all that luxury? mostly for having rtx capabilities, that unsure if the high price tag was to insure the foundation of rtx support in games (which is not much of a reality, not it seems) or a big money grab of because nvidia has grown overly confident that their consumers will have no choice but to buy their cards at whatever price they are listed for after watching the bitcoin mining consumer market devastation

Bitcoin works therefore on the idea of *consensus rules*. We all agree that right now, a miner can not reward themselves more than 12.5BTC plus the transaction fees for those transactions they put in the block. We also agree that the block is only valid if it proves the work was put in by creating a hash that is under the target difficulty.

if such an act of ""crypto-terrorism"" happens on a big scale like taking out the #4 crypto, I think there will be a giant pullback in the space overall.  there might be a temporary rush to BTC if it's seen as a safe haven asset but OTOH maybe people wonder if it's safe to entrust one's life savings to the very miners that just bankrupted the #4 coin and everyone who held it.

Uber/Lyft sure as shit hasn't exactly led to a Utopian change.

That said, from a purely ML perspective, at some point in the (distant) future when there are methods for generating code to fulfill some task, a paradigm like this could be useful as a way of thinking about how to disassemble programs into sub-components and (ultimately) writing/reusing code into large scale projects. There was a cool paper on reinforcement learning using typical model-free approaches to learning motor programs, then a higher level scheduler to use those low level programs to accomplish goals.

Ã¢ÂÂ..the best long-term results were achieved by accumulating Bitcoin whenever the Mayer Multiple was below 2.4.  Ã¢ÂÂ



Historically, price seems to find a secular bottom relative to its boom bust cycle when the multiple is around .5

We seem to be on a trajectory that is confluent with hitting the multiple at .5, around the time when BTC price hovers around 6.5k.  This price is where many chartists myself included see the bottom at 6.5k Ã¢ÂÂ the measured move from the current descending triangle after losing 8k horizontal support.  At that multiple range, price is firmly entrenched as historically .5 has meant price is at a secular bottom in its life cycle since inception. (Ã¢ÂÂGains lockedÃ¢ÂÂ) .  I believe this is also why its more useful to look at BTC price bottoms year after year to understand the storage of value proposition.  The bottoms are ironclad (if you were fortunate enough to accumulate there) though the volatile price action above it is the domain of the degenerate traders and FOMOers.

In other words, BTC is soon approaching this secular bottom level again.  It might not rise for a while (as is usually the case) but price should hold the range (where accumulation happens, unsurprisingly) to set the stage for the next slow rise up and parabolic leg but not before a long period of sideways meandering in price and the .5 multiple range.",f4z13bq,26.0,neutral

temp_plus,"imo all this would be enough...

**Add more Scav spawns to specific areas** - Right now people just rush to specific loot spots, for the chance at 100k+ value items. Most commonly Resort locked rooms, Techlight, Labs Ledx spawns, western Rezerve buildings etc. Add Scavs that almost always spawn in these areas at the start of the raid. Whilst you can just kill them with a pistol, it still slows down the hatchet runs, and forces them to make a lot of noise. Slow reactions mean blackened limbs, or even death.

**Dynamic loot, or just more Static spawns** - Dynamic loot mechanics for loose loot is the dream, however this may require a lot of work, so an alternate. Just add more static spawns for the high-value loose loot. For example, give the Red Keycard 10 more spawn locations around Resort. Same for Ledx &amp; Tetriz/Bitcoin spawns. Force hatchet runners to search many rooms to find the good loot. Once again, slowing them down, allowing others to catch up &amp; kill them

**Add an animation when placing items into your Secure Container** - This one hurts everyone, but a 10-20 second immobile, loud animation is a much better alternative to removing it. The goal being to slow down hatchet runners even more, and together with the above two changes, you have a pretty good chance of catching them before they pocket all the loot.

**Lock the Secure Container for the first 10 minutes of the raid** - Most hatchet running happens within the first 10 minutes of the raid. Naked player rush to high value loot spots and pocket the valuables before geared players can stop them. This would completely stop that style of play. There is no spot on any map that you cannot get to within 10 minutes, no matter wear you spawn, even if you bring heavy gear.


Those changes alone i believe would reduce the effectiveness of hatchet runs, whilst hurting everyone else relatively little. At the very least, i believe we should give these changes a chance before removing the container completely. Neither these changes, nor removing the SC, will completely stop hatchet runs. All we can do is make them inefficient to the point that the more popular methods involve more gear.

Some other changes i believe are worth some consideration...

**Gearscore** - A pretty hated change, but listen. I am not saying you should be required to bring in a full kit. However i do think that at least bringing in a pistol should be required. Its a very, very small cost. Yes, players can just insure &amp; drop the pistol. Its not a perfect solution. Its not meant to be. However the push to encourage players to bring a ranged weapon might be enough to get them fighting scavs, rather than avoiding everything &amp; everyone.

**Container items cannot be sold on the Flea Market** - If you extract with an item in your container, you cannot sell it on the Flea Market. This helps prevent hatchet runners flooding the economy. You can still turn the item in for quests/hideout upgrades, and still sell it to vendors(mostly so newer players are able to continue upgrading their traders).",fb51smj,2.0,neutral

where-is-satoshi,"u/master144777 made a new post, I checked his profile and noticed an odd exchange with him and u/pablo_tittibar, master gave Pablo $30 in bitcoin as a random act of kindness about 4 months ago, during his very short comment history.

Recognizing pablos name right away I thought this very strange as pablo has been showing off ""his"" garden shots all week, which I already found suspect. A review of pablos profile revealed his age of 19 which led to furthur review which led to his activity in r/dropship several months ago.

tidemp,"if you live in the western world, it's tough to live large for very long on 24btc. even if you sold at the top of the bubble. 

and most people have a very hard time holding when the price starts going up. and up. and up. (or down as it also tends to do). 

I've seen it many times. People who _should_ be millionaires. Early adopters who were huge believers in bitcoin and then got cold feet at some point. One friend was an early miner, 2012-2013 time frame. Had a good number of coins. And then in mid 2015 he had a phase of being burnt out. Tired of the space and starting to doubt bitcoin's future. 

It only takes a few days of doubt to open the door to a sale that almost guarantees you'll never get to the same coin-level again. 

He sold a few hundred coins in the low $300's. Made more than 50x on his initial investment. From one perspective, that's pretty awesome. From another angle, it's probably the biggest financial mistake of his life...

But holding is hard. That's the simple truth of it.",fdk3jm4,146.0,neutral

xrp_reddit_guy,"privacy coins are the only types of coins that should be used for payment imo. think of this scenario, if you use bitcoin to buy something at a walk in shop, they know your wallet address and can see if you're a btc millionare. your wallet is publicly visible. even if you have multiple wallets and your jackpot is in another one its easily traceable if someone is motivated.

RYO imo is a crappy coin. its a fork of SUMO which was a failure. RYO now its very similar to XMR except it has a larger ring size 20 something vs 11 for XMR. 11 is enough. fee structure is slightly different. the active development of XMR and the network effect means XMR wins again. for anyone accepting XMR i doubt they would switch to RYO or add it, its not really used at all for payment. XMR is barely used as it is. as goes with adoption of payment coins in general, its just worse for privacy coins at this time.

fyi there are two ""types"" of private payment coinsm, cryptonote (xmr, ryo, sumo, etc) and Zerocoin (zcash, bitcoin private?, etc) 

there is the exception of using stablecoins for payment, like DAI, as they are suitable for actual spending since they are not volatile. could a private stablecoin exist? perhaps, but it would incur a cost to create it higher than for e.g. DAI/MakerDaO.",fep4ymq,13.0,neutral

spirtdica,"thx for this. 

never been in a bear though? Hmm... in one way I get it. I think.

Bitcoin has always had a huge group of holders who are so far in the money that the recent drop - even 80-90% drops - don't matter much. 

For me, the 2018-19 price action wasn't a huge deal. I'd already taken 15x of what I put in off the table. And was also able to hold onto more than 80% of my btc and that portion was always hugely in the money.

So I get that part. 

But it's hard to know how much of the market is represented by 10x+ in the money BTC. I've never seen a good analysis of this. 

For the flip side, the 2014-2015 bear market felt very, very real. I worked at two major bitcoin/crypto companies. And there were periods of existential concern. 

There was confidence too. but there was a shadow of the bear during those years. We were getting pilloried - by almost everyone. And this wasn't just about standard risks from the speculative market, but massive regulatory risk that can be hard to wrap your head around today...  

And the mood in the daily was just ... different. 

If you're interested in doing a bit of archaeology, it might be fun to poke around the Jan/Feb 2015 daily threads. 

Anyway, on the whole I'd say we've lived through real bear markets. Full stop. 

I think the rest of your post is on point. This thing could so easily go back to $7k. In fact, I'd be a bit surprised if it didn't.

I'd also be surprised if we don't see a new ATH by end of 2021.

Kin will show the way. That is why Coindesk listed Ted as most influential for 2019. When people realize this its going to be huge. You thought Bitcoin going from $1 to $20,000 was cool?

I would say IOTA, but we have to see what's going to happen with the hack and how the aftermath will play out. So don't buy now.

I'm also known for being a NANO ""shill"", go test the coin with one of the faucets and see yourself what it's worth it to you, because you won't get any decent answer about it in here anyways.

Interested in Tezos atm, but don't know much yet.

Maybe keep an eye on Stellar, but it looks pretty dead rn, at least to me.

All kind of my bags, but not that much in eth and btc anymore. i don't own xmr atm, nor do I have a bag of stellar (had a small bag back in 17 tho).

To be honest, expecting people to comment on coins they don't own or are not interested in isn't going to work, because if you're informed on something you usually run with it.

theoneandonlymnh,"again what a load of delusional bullshit.   
The author of the article hinges his argument on the misguided notion that the current financial system ""rests on very fragile foundations.""    
When in fact the way bitcoin has been ""used"" by the majority of its use base is more prone to react to negative news because they fear ""FUD"". The reason BTC market is so FUD sensitive is because BTC does not have any financial base to support it, the only reason it is at the current price is because of blind greedy hype.    
Hype is the only reason BTC goes up.  Which is why the community loaths FUD.   
If BTC has any real economic value then FUD would have little to no effect.   
Furthermore the author is stuck in the past where BTC was the only crypto in the market space. But that is certainly no longer true, there are hundreds of viable cryptos that are doing things better, faster, more secure and cheaper than bitcoin.

trout-bch,"With regards to the draft, I did get off the hook in the end after being officially diagnosed. Gender dysphoria is already enough and surprisingly, so is autism/ aspergers. 

Well it was a long story. I was already consciously aware of myself and the difference, even as early as high school. At that age, I was already floating the idea of how to get out of the draft. It was a huge motivating factor for me to make as much money as I can before college ends. In my mind, I just want to get out of the country as soon as possible. That's it. A plan thought out years ahead.   
Adding to the fact that my thinking patterns are just so logical being on the autistic spectrum, national propaganda rarely ever worked on me from a very young age without me questioning it deeply. I was already an atheist by middle school despite not knowing the actual word at all, and my parents have almost 0 influence on me in terms of religion too.  It was just so easy for me to see through the lies in the rather collective society that I live in, a good lie on history that keeps most people together and united.   
*Majority of people stick together and look to others for social cues because biologically it is always the safest way to navigate life, and it makes sense in the hunter-gatherer life during the early stage of human evolution. Those that went on themselves are probably eaten and thereby eliminated through natural selection.*    


With that in mind, it actually turns out to have a huge impact later in my life, as I invested most of my teens in my career &amp; my special interest more. Probably just occasional partying &amp; socialising once a month.  
I didn't go through the regular education route, surfing through high school &amp; tertiary education just barely passing. School was never about learning anything to me, it was always a legal way for me to delay the draft while I am still building my financials. So I'm mostly just a borderline pass-er in exams, or sometimes seen as a 'drop-out' because I had to purposely fail exams to be retained for a year.   


At about 17 I was already operating an online business as a software programmer with profits of up to 30k USD a month. Also found out about cryptocurrencies at the same time (7 years ago), and bought + traded bitcoin, and invested a lot of my time in learning to invest/ trade my proceeds too.   
 *(software programming &amp; trading the markets is all logical work and 0 emotions and its one of the most natural way I can express my thoughts most effectively being autistic.)*  
By now I'm kinda already set for life, more than what I can ever ask for this lifetime to the point where retirement isnt even a thing that I have to worry already. Programming, and contributing to open source codes online for free + trading the financial markets right now is just a past-time.  
 

After going through all these emotional trauma over the years, I honestly no longer feel anything to my country of birth anymore. Even hearing the name of the country disgust me so much.  Despite already being off the hooks, I am still making it a life goal right now for me to live aboard and settle elsewhere.   


Its quite odd how life turns out, despite the difficulties early on in my life. Being autistic, and the environment (a collective/ an authoritarian country) was actually the determining factor to my success. If I am able to go through life once again, I'll still take the rough path over and over again.   
\-----------------  
Yes I did freeze my sperm aboard 2 years ago 'just in case' before I started HRT. Fertility will still come back when I stop HRT though, but it will take over 3\~6 months for viable sperm to be produced again. *(This is something that some trans are unwilling to accept, as going off estrogen can be quite traumatizing emotionally, add on top of the slight masculinization during the few months.)*  
My hopes for parenthood are quite high, although I admit I still have a lot to work on emotionally before being able to commit to any relationship Ã°Â Human to human relationship just don't come naturally to me, I have to work my way out and learn it.   


\-----------------  
Think of the times when you spend learning new things, it is frustrating isnt it? It seems to be the default mode of thinking for me regardless most of the time, I feel that it is why it seems to be quite logical from the surface. However, it is only because I'm going through so much more to come to any conclusion rationally. I'm still emotional like anyone else, but it is suppressed.

That surely also comes at a cost, when I get so drained at the end of the day when heading to events like parties. I just need a few days or a week to recharge at home. It was sort of a mask, despite the fact that I seems to appear normal just as everyone else in the room.

One cannot just go ""100 eth spot long + 100 quanto short"" and earn funding because if bitcoin increases 20% your position has become ""100 eth spot long + 120 quanto short."" The size of your position changing might not seem a big deal for retail speculators, but it probably is pretty important for market makers taking on very large position (and need to keep their books in check/neutral)

see also: 

https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/understanding-quanto-risk-and-opportunity/

In the past I tried to run various arbitrage strategies on the quanto swap; it seems the funding on the quanto swap is actually fairly priced at an average of 3.5% per month (or 0.1% per day), this was my average cost of dynamically adjusting my positions, in the end I was running breakeven and I could not outperform the ""easy money funding"" on the ethusd swaps; probably somebody smarter has running some algorithm to price this stuff accurately. 



the ethusd quanto future should have an average premium of 10% per quarter, which seems insane, but is the ""fair price."" My estimate of 10% is because ""long quanto swap at 0.1% average for 90 days"" should equal ""short 10% quanto future premium.""

Gavin was the one Satoshi put in charge of the Bitcoin project when he left. Gavin also started the conversation about raising the block size in 2012, and started really pushing for it in 2013. I spoke with him in May 2013 about some threats I saw coming down the pipe for Bitcoin, and he told me quite frankly that the only threat he was worried about was people trying to stall the block size increase. At the time I thought that was the craziest thing, because **EVERYONE** wanted the block size to go up, people just had different ideas on how aggressive or conservative it should be. I am still in shock about how everything went down, and how accurate his fears were.

Through some of the shadiest political maneuvering I've ever seen, he was ousted from the project in 2016. He had spent years trying to gather support for the Bitcoin Foundation to ensure Bitcoin developers could get paid from sources free from conflict of interest, attempting to prevent exactly the kind of hostile takeover that was performed by Blockstream.

* WasnÃ¢ÂÂt going to address this and Morgan has been asking her for months, but with all the DMs/comments she wanted to make sure that we all understood that she wasnÃ¢ÂÂt okay staying in an abusive relationship for 10 years. Wants to clarify this. She was called every name in the book, including body shaming :( (I will not repeat any of the horrible names). Wants to share what she dealt with before and after the show and made a list of all the lies she found out about after TI because theyÃ¢ÂÂre crazy.
* Met Evan when they were 19, right before he went to USC for a full ride (basketball). Tried to date, didnÃ¢ÂÂt work out, (dating a college athlete is a nightmare). From 2009-2012 they were very on and off and dated other people.
* 2012 his dad died, she would never talk down on that. She says it made a change in him. Talked about how she was supportive of him and his family and very involvedÃ¢ÂÂ¦ said he did the same thing that he did on TI in Summer 2012. He had a psychotic breakdown and moved to Washington and dated a random Volleyball player he barely knew for 3 months. She said that he has done this before,  it was a patternÃ¢ÂÂ¦ has breakdowns and starts a new life.
* At that point kicked him out completely, but on his birthday her friends encouraged her to reach out, he texted back immediately (she had been ignoring him for months even though he had texted her a lot). She noticed a big change in himÃ¢ÂÂ¦ said she went to go hang out with him and he was loving and affectionate and kind. 3 weeks after this they went exclusive. From that point until weeks before TI things were good and they were best friends. Said he had a lying problem but didnÃ¢ÂÂt realize how bad until after TI.
* 2-3 years before filming TI, she turned 26-27 got her shit together, got a FT job running Gap stores in Hawaii and California, was In higher management, got her own apartment. She was expecting him to be an adult, pay equal on the bills ... (Cut the video of here because of her  pup so went a bit off topic when she came back in the next paragraph)
* Says her dad had an analogy about her and Evan and it was the frog in boiling water (when she first met him it was normal water and slowly the water just kept getting hotter, at TI it was boiling and she was like ""WTF am I in?"")
* During College was normal for him not to have a job as he was on a full ride on his basketball scholarship, then his dad happened and wasnÃ¢ÂÂt going to get on his ass then about getting a job. When she was 26-27 was when she needed things to change and told him they both needed to be adults. Thats when the gaslighting and mental and emotional abuse started because he knew she wouldn't put up with bullshit anymore and enable him. Says her confidence was intimidating to Evan.
* Her friends and family said it got to the point where she wasn't herself anymore. Was very careful, her anxiety was out of control, couldn't eat infront of Evan. He would pick fights with people on the street (beating the shit out of people), punch holes in walls, small doors. Spit on her at a Christmas party, recorded it and tried to make it look like it was her fault. Those were just small things in the 2-3 years before TI. He full blown brainwashed her during these years.
* She knew in her heart and gut something was wrong and started researching and reading, but she was so brainwashed by Evan that she convinced herself that her anxiety was out of control, because Evan would constantly tell her that. She would try to leave him and he would sob uncontrollably and threaten to hurt himself. She has a huge heart and is sensitive and he knew that she wouldn't leave him if he did that.
* Feb 2018 (before they went on TI) - they shared an iPad and she opened it and it opened into his Instagram DM's and there were 40-60 messages from women. She found all kinds of shit like he was facetiming his Ex even though he told her she was stalking him. She told him he had 3 days to get out. He had a full blown breakdown, it was really bad, she left work early because she was worried about him. She came home and the ""infamous ultimatum happened"". He told her he'd do anything. She laid it down seriously and told him how it would work. Said he needed to get a FT job and needed to pay 50/50 of the bills. Said the behaviour - if she even thought things were going down he was out instantly on the streets. Mentioned that his mom venmo'd her $400 a month rent. Said she needed a real commitment by her birthday. Said he was a gentleman from that moment on until the moment they parted ways on the first episode of TI.
* After the show it was bad, doesn't remember what happened. People told her how insane it was but what we saw doesn't even do it justice how bad it was. Remembers being in the car and going through McDonalds. She went to a Hotel room by herself and sat up on the bed all night until the sun came up watching Talladega nights on a marathon repeat (11-6). Went to sleep for 45 minutes, did her last interview, went to the airport had a redeye flight with huge suitcase. Get to LAX at 6AM, (says this is hard to talk about) knew she had to save as much money and needed to figure out how to get all her luggage across the airport into an Uber and it was horrible and she just needed to get through it without breaking down.
* She never reached out to him after that, never wanted to speak with him again. When they got back, his brother had been watching the show and Evan had reached out (Happy Birthday, DMing her friends, DMing her, crying in public). His brother said she had to let him come over, she let him sleep on the couch with no pillow no blanket sobbing on the couch all night.

**THE LIES** 

* Kaci had a fully paid off car she loved, when they were moving back she sold that car in order to get them back to LA, under the impression he would ship his over. Months went by, it never came and he made up a story about how he talked to the dealership in Hawaii and would sell it back to the dealership. He stopped making payments on the car the second they moved to LA for months , had been getting repossession letters, lawsuit letters and they couldn't find the car. He told Morgan that Kaci didn't have a license to drive, never owned a car and that she's irresponsible. 
* 10 years she knew Evan he worked for 9 months at a restaurant. The entire time they lived in LA he lived on unemployment and Kaci paid for absolutely everything (except the $400 a month rent from his mom). She worked at GAP (operations manager) and worked at a tanning salon. Would wake up at 2-3AM to work at Gap and then work at 1-2 in the afternoon. Would take a bus from the mall to tanning place (hours on a bus). Would work until 9 at night and get home at 11. Would get home and Evan would do nothing, be high as F and have eaten all the food she paid for. She did this 6 days a week and would cry at work because of how exhausted she was. Told her that he will be strong for her later in life when they have kids. Told the cast that Kaci was the one at home while he was out hustling and being a ""bitcoin baby"".",fyzcejw,626.0,neutral

Their customer service is already terrible.  Got a problem?  There is no number to call.  Send an email and wait over a week and hope they respond and understand your question.  It is like communicating with pigeons with them.  Not to mention every time you update the ledger hardware you are rolling the dice and have a high chance of bricking.

I left them a while ago and no longer recommend them as regularly.  The trezor device experience was worse than ledger's though it seems they take customer security more seriously.

Edit:

My issue is not that they legally may have to hold customer information.  It's the eye roll that I can feel through the screen.  Maybe English is not his primary language, but their whole approach has been ""calm down your funds are safe"".

tralxz,"u/HarryPFlashman is pointing out that if electricity was free, the cost of crypto mining would be paid for by taxpayers.

Because it is designed this way, bitcoin mining takes increasingly more processing power and/or time to get the same results as in the past. In the beginning you were able to mine bitcoins with single desktop PCs (albeit slowly), which didn't cost much in electricity.

As more and more bitcoins were mined, the availability of mining new bitcoins decreased, which meant miners had to start building specialized rigs based on GPUs, otherwise they would be spending more money on the electricity to mine a bitcoin than the actual value of the bitcoin itself.

Since GPUs are expensive, the cost of mining bitcoins became even more prohibitive since it took many more GPUs and much more electricity to mine a bitcoin than it used to. If electricity bills were paid by tax funds, mining rigs would pay for themselves and make miners wealthy at cost to the taxpayers.",g2njw3e,14.0,neutral

What the Mayer Multiple is: The Mayer Multiple was created by Trace Mayer as a way to analyse the price of Bitcoin in a historical context. 
It does NOT tell whether to buy, sell or hold. The Mayer Multiple is the multiple of the current Bitcoin price over the 200-days moving average.

Why 2.4 ? Simulations performed by Trace Mayer determined that in the past, the best long-term results were achieved by accumulating Bitcoin whenever the Mayer Multiple was below 2.4.

Because Craig can't code, can't not contradict himself, and can't say anything remotely original or even thoughtful.

Craig just says idiotic or erroneous platitudes prefaced with ""What many don't understand is..."" because that's the cover for his complete lack of depth or even meaning: he's saying that it's subtle and that only the enlightened few can understand his esoteric wisdom.

Nonsense. Everything he says is hilariously wrong. He's astounding ignorant, and only bamboozles those lacking coherency &amp; consistency in their thoughts because they are susceptible to his brand of overly-emphatic obscurantism coupled with belligerent attacks on shared antagonists.

unitedstatian,"theres so many things that are wrong with the statements youre making. What is the main innovation that Bitcoin holds over ETH?

I would argue that ETH is far more innovative than bitcoin, as it is continuously growing and has far more development and adoption than any other blockchain. The development of ETH is actually far more decentralized than BTC. ETH is developed by thousands of developers around the world. Some of them exist in teams which take on parts of the core development of things like ETH 2.0 phase 1. Vitalik is one of the founders of ETH, but he's not the leader in any sense. He is more involved in research and merely makes suggestions to development teams to implement new ideas. These development teams and the community vote on whether these upgrades are applied or not.

Miners of ETH 1.0 are actually far more decentralized than BTC. ETH is still accessible to the average miner and it has been for a while. The majority of BTC hash power comes from 2 mining farms in China.

Removing governance from any blockchain is a terrible idea. BTC still has governance. The aim is to have a balanced governance that would maximize the benefit of the users and the health of the blockchain over time. ETH is actively working on governance of ETH. But at this point in time it's important to have some centralized leadership in creating 2.0. Imagine creating a video game where all the developers didn't talk to each other and there was no collective idea, and every single piece of the code had to be voted on. It doesn't work unfortunately. The idea is to develop a platform that fosters optimal decentralized governance. But at this point ETH is actually already doing a great job at that. Another thing is democracy doesn't work when you have an uneducated population. In the case of blackchain the majority of people have no idea what they would be voting for.",g4wmaq7,280.0,neutral

Is what i used along with some quick guides on r/ethstaker.

I honestly recommend you don't use windows, (it's what i used) and I'm not familiar with linux. But in the long run it would be the best to use linux. 

Here is my attempt at a guide if you want to play around using windows and prysm. A lot of the guides are split between multiple web pages and by the end of it my browser looked like the end of a college research paper. So here is my attempt to consolidate it using windows and prysm.

**This is for Windows**

**STEP 1 - Getting Your Beacon Node up and Running**

For windows, I had a separate SSD that I used for everything eth2.0 validating related. The actual beacon chain data was stored on my C: drive. 

I used prysm - so that is my reference point. Make a new folder named prysm wherever you want.  

I just had it in my G: drive. You will be going there a lot using the terminal. remember the path to it (i.e. 

    G:\prysm or C:\Program Files\prysm, wherever you make that folder.)

Open up command prompt in windows (click windows icon&gt;search cmd&gt; run it)

It will take you to a black screen window. If your prysm folder is in your main HDD or SSD 

    (C:\) 

you are ready for next step. If you opted to put it in a separate HDD/SSD you will need to switch drives.

Just type the letter of the drive and : and press enter. Example: If it was in your G: drive just type

    G:

press enter

then navigate to the prysm folder type cd and copy paste the path the prysm folder. cd means change directory

    cd G:\prysm  or cd C:\Program Files\prysm

Follow prysm installation guide, mostly copy and paste the instructions remembering to change the path names to the ones that match your instance

1. once you are in the prysm folder it should look like

    G:\prysm    

copy and paste (**don't copy and paste my link use the actual prysm docs link for safe practice**)

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/master/prysm.bat --output prysm.bat    

I didn't run an eth 1.0 node because i didn't want to deal with syncing it. I remember doing that with bitcoin years ago and i really don't have the time. However, with actual eth staking I would run an eth 1.0 node and sync it (that will take a long time) I used a third party node infura. 

    Open up your browser go to infura and create account. 

    Log in&gt;click ethereum&gt;click new project&gt;name it&gt;click on the project&gt;Settings&gt;

    Under ""Keys"" change endpoint to Gorli&gt; copy the https link underneath 

Now go back to the terminal 

Make sure you are in the prysm folder still and type in 

       prysm.bat beacon-chain --http-web3provider=&lt;YOUR_ETH1_NODE_ENDPOINT_without the =&lt;&gt; &gt;

delete everything after = sign and after it and paste (ctrl V) your infura link

It should look like this, where everything before \prysm.bat is the path to your prsym folder and after web3provider includes your link the your infura Gorli endpoint (there is space between proveider and your infura link)

    G:\prysm\prysm.bat beacon-chain --http-web3provider &lt;YOUR_ETH1_NODE_ENDPOINT&gt;

Your beacon node will now start syncing, it will take about about a day at it's current size. If everything is done right. And now you wait for you beacon node to sync. it will show you the progress and the estimated time in the terminal window. ctrl mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the command prompt terminal window.


**Congratulations, your eth 2.0 beacon node should be running properly and syncing now**


**STEP 2 - Getting Your Validator Keys**


Next go to the [medalla launch pad](https://medalla.launchpad.ethereum.org/overview) and follow that instruction. Download the eth 2.0 client and extract the folder to wherever you want (i would keep it in the same drive as your prysm folder) [https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-deposit-cli/releases](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-deposit-cli/releases) download the latest windows zip file under assets (as of now it is v.0.4.1 ""I am Zinkin...)

**I included links to everything but NEVER NEVER NEVER download using links from random people online (which I am) Find the official sites yourself and download it that way. PRACTICE SAFETY make sure the certificates match up, official sites, and the url is spelled correctly etc**

Get your 32 test net ether Gorli Eth via ethstaker discord or the clients discord or a faucet. Use metamask, change network to Gorli. You don't want to send real eth. I won't go in depth with this part, you should know the basics of working with ether and metamask if you plan on staking. 

After extracting the eth2.0 cli folder, I recommend changing the name of the folder to something manageable (ex. eth2deposit-cli)

Open up a new Command Prompt terminal. Navigate to the new eth2deposit-cli folder. Remember if it's in another drive you first have to change drives by typing the letter of the drive the folder is in and : then enter. If it's in the main C:\ drive just type cd and copy and paste the path the eth2deposit-cli folder

    cd G:\eth2deposit-cli

then copy/paste (change the 1 to whatever amount of validators you are running) (the instruction on the launchpad are clear I'm just putting it here to be redundant)

    deposit.exe --num_validators 1 --chain medalla    

follow instructions that show up. Here is where your mnemonic shows up (physically write it down). Create strong password for the wallet and write it down

After you finish that part, go back to the eth2deposit cli folder you should see a new folder validator_keys folder. Make sure there are 2 files and deposit data file and a keystore file. Upload the deposit_data.json file to the launchpad to make sure you are on the right chain and everything is good (medalla/zinken/etc.) 

Continue following the instruction &gt; you have to send the Goeth to the contract now. **Make sure you are on the Gorli Test net and you aren't sending real eth somewhere** It will confirm.

**Congratulations, you have your Eth 2.0 validating keys**


**STEP 3 - Running your Validator Keys**

Next up is running the actual Validator now

Open up a new command prompt terminal window,

Navigate to the prysm folder (you should know how to do it by now)


    G:

    cd G:\prysm

now you have to import the validating keys into prysm. delete everything after the =sign and paste the path to the validator key folder

    prysm.bat validator accounts-v2 import --keys-dir=&lt;loaction of your validator keys folder without the &lt;&gt; &gt;

Should look something like this    

    prysm.bat validator accounts-v2 import --keys-dir=G:\eth2deposit-cli\validator_keys

Follow instructions - and you are done.
 
You just have to wait for your beacon node to sync and then a little while extra for your validator to be activated on the chain. 


[https://beaconcha.in/](https://beaconcha.in/) is where you can view the list of pending validators and you can copy and paste your GOeth address to view your validators progress and operations.


Most problems I encountered were typos with regards to file/folder names and pathing errors (i would copy and paste but not properly change the path to my personal folders/files)

It's a good learning experience. The instructions from the prysm team and medalla launch pad are great. But they assume you know the absolute basics, which i obviously didn't know about.  I did not know about changing drives which caused some headaches at first. Google-fu is your friend, the folks over at r/ethstaker are great and immensely helpful. Discord rooms (ethstaker, prysm) are also filled with kind folks.

Links to those can be found at the their webpages and r/ethstaker sidebars. **Remember don't click on my links and use them, go find it yourself using official sources.**

zblarion,"You have a few misconceptions.  
Hashrate has no influence on how many XMR are emitted. The XMR protocol has the goal of 1 block every 2 minutes. If the hashrate rises, which means faster blocks, the mining difficulty will be adjusted by the protocol so the 2 minute goal is hit again. In Monero this happens every block with a 200 (I believe) block average, so it's a very fast adjustment.  
This means the amount of XMR emitted per year is a set value, and the supply is only increased linearly.  
The inflationrate will decrease forever heading to 0%. In 2022 when the tail emission begins, it will only be a 0.87% yearly inflation, decreasing every year (after 10 years, it will only be a 0.79% inflation).  

This means the effect on price is absolutely minimal, sub-1%.

altcoins are mostly all scams because they are mostly controlled by one or a few people. There's always some story about why it's great - kinda like penny stocks. Mostly it's all gambling because none of them have the security, track record and universality of Bitcoin. 

Ethereum - maybe a bit harder to say but it has some serious faults and if you are just concerned with storing value and sometimes buying stuff you can do without it. There's a truck load of scammy stuff don on top of Ethereum and if you start down that rabbit hole you'll most likely have even more confusion, headaches and lose your money in the end.

Bets bet for ease and security is to get a Trezor, Ledger or Coldcard and use that for  Bitcoin savings.

We had our pullback, but not down to the point where it resolved the long pole.  It did get down ""close enough"" a couple of times and it bounced up.

That said, based on the past seven years of activity, the ""normal"" formation is to see it ""pop up--then fiddle and diddle for a few days to a week, before it starts up again.  Don't be mislead by the high numbers.

I expect we are in that kind of atmosphere now where it will not simply keep skyrocketing without pulling back and resolving for a couple of days.

Just to bum everyone out...we do not get to another official break out until we exceed $18,500.  But we don't break down unless it goes under $15,800.  So, aside from the play on numbers...what we see in between there is ""noise.""

And to make everyone comfortable, the current trend line is down at $10,700.

user4morethan2mins,"in kpop scandal news, btob member ilhoon has reportedly been investigated for smoking the devil's lettuce (known academically as marijuana) regularly for years. my favorite part about this case is that he reportedly [bought weed with virtual currency](https://twitter.com/OH_mes2/status/1340982696026099713) (aka...bitcoin? probably?) to avoid detection. personally i think he's a genius, other people do not see it this way. i might be biased because ilhoon was my favorite member of btob back in my stanning days, but no one can confirm this.

some points of interest:

* btob have become known for their relatively squeaky clean image and for having strong vocalists. they started as a more theatrical/dance music focused group, but gained popularity by putting out vocally-driven ballads - their big break was [missing you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bykFvnRzno) which was a smash.
* they rely heavily on the general public connecting with their music as their fanbase is decently sized, but not large enough that they wouldn't feel the impact of the public refusing to interact with their music.
* ilhoon is the only person in the group who can actually rap (i said what i said) and is currently enlisted in the military. as much as i hate to admit it they could probably get rid of him and be fine, but their rap sections would definitely suffer for it.
* weed is a big deal in korea and more famous idols than ilhoon have had their careers ruined/tarnished because of it. i'm sure there are people who want to legalize it there, but by and large this is going to be seen as something he should be punished for and be ashamed of doing.

all that adds together to equal the fact that it's extremely possible ilhoon will be kicked from the group because he bought weed with bitcoin for five years. there's a small chance he'll get through this by keeping his head down, serving in the military and 'reflecting', but only time will tell.",ggnvbdq,125.0,neutral

zema6189,"tl;dr at the bottom. So in order to explain what mining is, you need to know the whole premise of what bitcoin is meant to represent. Bitcoin was designed as an implementation of blockchain, which is a buzzword that basically means ""We need a system to keep track of something (typically transactions, sales, purchases, etc.). We have to make sure everyone has a copy of this ledger, and that it's impossible to forge.""

Bitcoin came in as a ""proof of work"" system for verifying transactions. Basically, whenever someone buys or sells Bitcoin that they already own, they start a transaction: a problem is generated, and every computer that is involved with ""mining"" tries to solve it. It takes the form ""I'm thinking of a number that ends in 000000. Generate a random number that, when run through a hashing algorithm, ends in 000000."" The first computer on the network to solve this problem ""verifies"" the transaction. This attaches the transaction to the ledger, and for the ""proof of work"" that was done to verify it, the person who verified it gets some bitcoin.

Because every detail in this ledger has to line up and hashing is difficult, it's very very difficult to forge. If you wanted to change a transaction in the past (e.g. ""a week ago this guy gave me a million bitcoins, not just one""), or add your own (e.g. ""some guy just gave me a hundred dollars, I promise""), it would be nearly impossible to manipulate every transaction after that point to line up, since previous transactions factor into future ones, and if you want to update the ledger, you need to get more than half of the computers on the node to believe you. (Fun fact, if you owned more than half of the processing power that was currently mining any cryptocurrency, you could unilaterally do anything you wanted with all of it since you could just invent your own transactions and get more than half of the group to ""agree"" that it happened that way).

The key part of this is that hashing is difficult, that's the only reason crypto works. Technically speaking, an old pentium could get very lucky and randomly guess the solution to every transaction before anyone else, but graphics cards are very good at solving these types of problems, so miners tend to snatch them up for mining rigs. You can guess on the first try, or on the millionth try, but if you can guess a million times per second, chances are you'll verify a lot more transactions (and therefore get paid a lot more) than someone who can only guess a thousand times per second.

tldr: Mining crypto is the new version of being a notary and signing your name on other people's fancy sales. It's actually just the bank saying ""Guess what number I'm thinking of and I'll pay you for your time"" so you start guessing random numbers correctly so you can get paid a pittance. However, every so often these random numbers become harder to guess. The bank decides ""I've given too much bitcoin out recently just to notaries because everyone brought their random number generators so they could guess faster, so I'll make random guessing harder. Instead of between 1 and 10, now you have to guess between 1 and 1000."" As a result, the faster your computer can guess randomly, the more of a pittance you get paid, so miners buy new GPUs, work them half to death, and try to sell them for what they paid on Craigslist to unsuspecting people with words like ""Gently used"", ""never over 60% power"", but obviously not ""fan was running 24/7 for the last 8 months"" because miners lmao.",gjcex70,1269.0,neutral

So why is ethereum more valuable than bitcoin?

Bitcoin is valuable because it's a hedge against inflation. There is a hard cap of 21 million bitcoin. The issuance that bitcoin miners received is cut in half every 4 years, making bitcoin rely on transaction fees more and makes bitcoins monetary policy stronger.

Ethereum decided to solve a problem with determining an appropriate gas price and ended up creating eip-1559 which when combined with the merger (fully pos ethereum), it will likely make ethereum have a slightly deflationary supply.

Ethereum will get better gas pricing estimates, variable sized blocks to handle congestion, and a better monetary policy from eip-1559.

DeFi is the _killer_ feature of ethereum and DeFi has been exploding the last few weeks due to the gme incident. DeFi is just going to get better with zero knowledge rollups and even better when sharding is ready. 

Ethereum is just getting started, wait around and find out!

and how digital items for the longest time had a supply issue.  if you could make infinite copies of MP3s and AVIs and MOVs why would anyone EVER pay for a digital game, digital music, digital movies, etc...  


how only in-game purchases of character costume skins made sense as those couldn't be duplicated and shared.  so, restricted supply to match consumer demand.  


and then explaining that netflix blocking certain screen-capture technologies while also being cheap and easier to navigate than torrest and free-stream sites meant meant that they could continue to restrict supply while serving demand.  


that all of this restricted digital access means an ""always connected"" centralized digital network.  you don't Own this stuff you're simply renting access to it.  like how a photoshop license went from buying the software outright, to paying a cheaper monthly subscription.  


then i'd explain that bitcoin is a program that simply attempts to solve equations.  and that there are a finite amount of equations.  solving complex equations is called mining, and once you've solved the equation, THAT equation is assigned a hash that reflects it's code.  each hash, when checked can be verified by any computer running the bitcoin algorithm to double check the math.  


the finite amount of equations is where our fascination with the technology grows, because if this is like saying, ""catch all the pokemon, even the ugly and lame ones... there will never be any other pokemon... ever.""  the scarcity lowers supply.  and so any demand for it will be bottlenecked by the supply.  part of this is appealing, driving demand more.  and the reason for the rise in value is because on a long enough timeline - there will one day no longer be new bitcoin.  


then explain that doge was created as a joke - a much more simple algorithm.  enough to solve the equation but not any type of equation that actually has limits.  it's an infinite number of equations.  so ... on a long enough timeline, we'll have an infinite amount of doge mined... so unless demand stays at infinite levels, the value WILL collapse.",gut6q1p,130.0,neutral

Australian Football Ã°ÂÂÂ - Melbourne Demons v Sydney Swans

**Melbourne 1-39 -** ($2.00/+100) - 3 Units

Match starts \~ 7hrs from post

* I'm part **virus,** part human so losses do occur and results could change in an instant. Manage your bets and avoid all-ins. Take note of my unit sizes. Feel free to use my breakdown to your advantage.

KISS:

* Melbourne (WWWWW) are currently top of the ladder 4 points clear and undefeated this season.
* Their last match seemed abit shaky against the weak Kangaroos but still ended strong to defeat them by 30 points. They haven't had much trouble keeping opponents scores low.
* Melbourne's Petracca is having a superb season and is a favourite to win this years Brownlow (MVP).
* Sydney (WLLWW) are 5th on the ladder and expecting Franklin and Rampe to come back from injury.
* Despite their huge loss to Gold Coast, most of the Swans game have been close results.
* H2H: Swans are 9/10 against Melbourne but we can ignore this stat this year since Melbourne have been absolutely trash last few years.
* Prediction: Melbourne by 13 points. Sydney have covered 7/8 of their last matches as an underdog. So expect them to hang in their against a dominating Melbourne side. If you don't have 1-39 margin I recommend going **Melbourne ML** but for lower odds.
* If you like a gamble, I also like total points **Over 151.5**.

* Over draft is something you can opt out of at Chase. Just like you can't spend coins you don't have
* If you overdraft you have until 11pm that day to get positive before you're charged the fee - most other banks charge it instantly , per occurrence and don't give you the grace period. Seems pretty reasonable to me.
* If you read other articles you would know that anyone requesting a covid hardship had the fees reversed. this total was down 10-25% from previous years reported.

Yes, it's a big bank and no one likes a big bank but I don't see anyone handing out free money, except the US Government. Anyone have some bitcoin to lend me? Didn't think so.

It's easy to blame the banks who charge the fees, but how about looking at the people spending above their means? You entered a contract with them to keep your money there, you agreed to the terms. You being unable to ""balance your checkbook"" is not their concern.

USA, Myanmar, and Eritrea are the only countries to impose world wide taxation on its citizens. Americans will have no benefit to the taxation policy in El Salvador.  


For example, if I wanted to live full time in El Salvador because they have 0% capital gains on bitcoinÃ¢ÂÂ¦ As an American living in El Salvador, I would still owe the same capital gains to the USA regardless that I donÃ¢ÂÂt live in the USA.

  
If I were anything aside from a USA, Myanmar, or Eritrean citizenÃ¢ÂÂ¦ letÃ¢ÂÂs say for example, a Canadian living in El Salvador, I would owe 0% capital gains across the board, because Canada does not impose world wide taxation on its citizens like how the USA does, and El Salvador again has 0% capital gains on bitcoin.

  
It doesnÃ¢ÂÂt matter that Canada has high capital gains taxes on bitcoin for its domestic citizens in Canada. Since there is no world wide taxation imposed by Canada, Canadians have the freedom to avoid CanadaÃ¢ÂÂs taxes by choosing to live in another country with more favorable taxes.

  
Only USA, Myanmar, and Eritrea impose world wide taxation on its citizens, and we have zero ability to avoid those taxes, which is pretty fucked up and authoritarian.

Harmony has a scalable architecture due to sharding. So we're not concerned about scalability anymore, or as much. Rather, we're heavily focussed on a)bringing existing blockchain developers (from Ethereum) to deploy applications without any friction. b) Connecting with other important and growing blockchains through Bridges. c) Ensuring secure and on-chain wallets with seamless UX to bring the next 100M users.  


We've been working hard on each of the above initiatives. We have full Ethereum compatibility, it takes a few minutes to deploy Ethereum apps on Harmony, eg: Sushiswap was deployed 7 days ago and already has great traction. We have bridged with Ethereum, BSC, Terra and coming up with Bitcoin, Polkadot bridges. We're believe in a multi-chain world and therefore we're building the pipes and tunnels to make the future Dapps frictionless for end-users. Finally, you'll see some more developments on the keyless, on-chain wallet primitives.

We are working towards open-development and open-governance, which will be the backbone of our growing ecosystem. 

Each blockchain has their own strengths and approaches, but the above is what we believe in and are confident that this will be our long-term differentiator.",h55ldjg,720.0,neutral

Best I could do is maybe steal ideas and do them before anyone else does. but as a kid living in the middle of no where with zero connections, what can I really do.

svabuna123,"[There are bugs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues) of course, like with any other software. As you correctly pointed out being open source is crucial for bitcoin so that the code can be audited and tested in the open, bitcoin is among the top 5 open source projects (per value, as per some report I cannot find now, sorry),... I also believe the slow pace of releases shows that a careful auditing process is being made by the developer community. Lastly the bitcoin nodes can update to a new release, but they are not forced, so it will happen gradually making it less risky for a bug -or a malitious hack- of this kind to happen and damage the network.

Understanding this is a strong open source community (I can only think of Linux as a comparable community in terms of ww impact and success) should give a reasonable peace of mind in regards to being exposed to hacks or the likes.

Figure out your investment horizon.  Are you investing for a year from now, 5 years, or retirement in 20+.  IÃ¢ÂÂm guessing you werenÃ¢ÂÂt planning to sell this week or next, so donÃ¢ÂÂt worry and just invest diligently.",hdpvbmn,567.0,negative
xzotc,"Your crypto holdings remain the same, youÃ¢ÂÂre right. They are referring to the FIAT valuation. The following example will probably help:

LetÃ¢ÂÂs assume you buy 1.00 bitcoin at 50k USD. 

A week later, the market crashes and 1 BTC is only valued at 40k USD. you still have 1.00 (remains the same, as mentioned). However, the BTCUSD took a 20% hit, right? (20% of 50 is 10k, so now weÃ¢ÂÂre at 40k)

Now, letÃ¢ÂÂs assume another week goes by and the market recovers a bit. By the end of the next week, the market is up 20%, **but itÃ¢ÂÂs 20% from the closing price of the week prior, which was 40k USD**. 20% of 40k is 8k, so now BTC is valued at 48k USD. 

As you can see, the price dipped 20% and then gained 20%, but it didnÃ¢ÂÂt retutn to the initial 50k USD price point, as itÃ¢ÂÂs still 2k short. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs because in order to go back from 40k to 50k, you would require a 25% gain.",hduhx5c,782.0,neutral

Bitcoin solves this problem, it's not an entity, nor is it controlled by one. It's collaboratively run, contributited to, and maintained by millions across the world who simply want to take part. It is nothing more than a transfer protocol from which amazing financial applications can be built. No different from a protocol like TCP/IP which is the backbone of the modern internet and its....7?
