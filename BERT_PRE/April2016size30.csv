And given that the #1 reason given for not raising the cap right now is ""decentralisation!"", I guess I'm just surprised people are citing the relay network as a reason for why thin blocks shouldn't be implemented.

d1knzdq,tl121,10,"The 4MB conclusion seems about right, based on what I've seen with my collection of old and slow computers running over a crappy rural DSL link and using the existing inefficient Bitcoin software.  IMO there is tremendous scope for improvement in software efficiency, some of which has already been done since the paper's data was gathered, making it possible to get much higher throughput than the paper suggests without giving up the ability for all full nodes to see all the network data. (And without which, many people will simply not trust the system, i.e. they will no longer consider it either ""distributed"" or ""peer to peer"".)

With thin blocks (or extreme thin blocks) the overhead of block transmission (the paper's ""Consensus Layer"") can be effectively eliminated from consideration. 

As the paper points out, the performance of the ""Network Plane"" in transmitting transaction messages is the real bottleneck.  This can surely be optimized to where throughput approaches 80% or more of link bandwidth. Link bandwidth to handle Netflix HD movies is 5 Mb/s.  This corresponds to 1500 transactions per second (tps)(reduced by overhead).  In my case, even with my slower DSL upload of 1 Mb/s it is still 300 tps before accounting for overhead.

The ""Storage Plane"" has already been (largely) addressed by block pruning. It is not presently low hanging fruit. 

The ""View Plane"" is already effectively supported by SPV clients

You do not know the origin of your Bitcoin, so you can not say for certain if they are related to gambling activity, are stolen or connected to other illegal activities.

d1ky53i,psztorc,9,"&gt; Any estimate on when this could go live, like this year/next year/when it's done?

Nope, haha.

It is -certainly- a very reasonable *thing to want to know*. However, it is an unreasonable *question* because it is too difficult to provide an honest answer (and too tempting to ""cheat"" and just guess something at random).

[Here is the roadmap](http://bitcoinhivemind.com/blog/roadmap/), though. It is a vague measurement of progress.

I am currently focused on Drivechain, because Hivemind first needs Drivechain in order to work (as a sidechain).

( By the way, here is [a funny link to a Bitshares forum post in May 2014](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php/topic,4645.0.html) where prediction markets (ht Fairlay) were themselves used to forecast the launch of Bitshares. These PMs nearly-perfectly guessed the true launch date of Aug 22...much to the amazement of the Bitshares community/leadership (who, of course, were chanting ""soon"" and ""two weeks"" endlessly). Currently, there are [only 3 cryptocurrency PMs](https://www.fairlay.com/event/category-decimal/news/bitcoin/all/) on Fairlay that I could find, but perhaps we should persuade Martin to add some for LightningNetwork and Hivemind. That way, everyone could learn [especially me]! )",2016-04-01 06:04:02

d1mjxpp,todu,35,"Slush (/u/slush0) wrote the below on [this page](https://slushpool.com/news/2016/04/01/adam-back-prague/):

&gt; ""Hello Miners,

&gt; I am very happy to announce that Adam Back, a British cryptographer and crypto-hacker ***whose work directly inspired creation of Bitcoin*** [Emphasis mine.], is coming to Prague at the invitation of Slush pool.""

You're making it sound like Bitcoin would never have been invented if Adam Back would not have invented Hashcash first. That is giving Adam Back unreasonably much credit for his invention. **The ""Proof of Work"" invention had already been invented in 1993, and Adam Back ""invented it again"" in 1997 because he didn't know that it had already been invented.**

I wrote a timeline that I posted in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/46vq7i/adam_back_did_not_invent_proof_of_work/d088sab) when this was last discussed a month ago. I'll include that timeline below:

&gt; Ok, so the correct timeline for who gets credits for what, seems to be:
&gt; 
&gt; \*Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor invent the ""proof of work"" method to combat email spam and [publish their paper](http://view.samurajdata.se/psview.php?id=9f743599&amp;page=1) in **1993**.  
&gt; \*Adam Back's [Hashcash paper published](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hashcash&amp;oldid=705746368) in **1997**.  
&gt; \*Satoshi Nakamoto invents Bitcoin and publishes the Bitcoin whitepaper in **2008**.  
&gt; \*Satoshi Nakamoto emails Adam Back in person wanting to talk about Bitcoin in **2008**.  
&gt; \*Adam Back ignores Satoshis email in **2008**.  
&gt; \*Satoshi Nakamoto launches Bitcoin and mines the genesis block in **2009**.  
&gt; \*Adam Back ignores Bitcoin in **2009**.  
&gt; \*Adam Back ignores Bitcoin in **2010**. (1 XBT &lt; 1 USD)  
&gt; \*Adam Back ignores Bitcoin in **2011**. (1 XBT = 32 USD)  
&gt; \*Adam Back ignores Bitcoin in **2012**.  
&gt; \*Adam Back buys his first Bitcoin at the height of the bubble for about 1000 USD / XBT in late **2013**.  
&gt; \*Adam Back founds the Blockstream company in November **2014**.  
&gt; \*Adam Back's company [hires 9 of the main Bitcoin Core developers](https://web.archive.org/web/20150228003347/http://www.blockstream.com/team/) during **2014-2015**.  
&gt; \*Adam Back changes [his Twitter profile description](https://web.archive.org/web/20140325194946/https://twitter.com/adam3us) to ""inventor of hashcash (bitcoin is hashcash extended with inflation control)"" in early **2014**.  
&gt; \*Adam Back is suddenly the ""inventor of the proof-of-work algorithm that Bitcoin uses"".  
&gt; \*Adam Back is suddenly ""basically the inventor of Bitcoin"".  
&gt; \*Adam Back is suddenly ""The inventor of Bitcoin"".  
&gt; \*Adam Back (/u/adam3us) has never corrected a single Redditor who has claimed that Adam Back has invented Bitcoin's proof-of-work algorithm or that he is ""almost Satoshi"" despite the above timeline. Because why would he.  
&gt; \*Adam Back's [current twitter profile description](https://twitter.com/adam3us) still says ""inventor of hashcash (bitcoin is hashcash extended with inflation control)"".  
&gt; \*Adam Back knows what's best for Bitcoin's future. We should trust and listen to him.

You, Slush, personally invited Adam Back to meet you and your miners. **Are you going to invite for example Gavin Andresen and / or Jeff Garzik to another future meeting as well?

Big picture...  for bitcoin to succeed it needs a much higher valuation (MUCH higher.... like thousands per coin minimum).  A success scenario I see is growing valuation and growing number of hodlers before it really gains any traction as an actual currency.  If the coins have a high enough perceived value and enough people have them there will be sufficient incentive to use them for commerce and that will begin to create long term velocity.  Imagine a coin value of $8k with 5% of the world's population owning at least some bitcoin.  At that level it would make sense for merchants to cater to that client base to pry some bitcoins from them.  Right now the value is primarily speculative that bitcoin will be a thing in the long run.  If so, it's stupid cheap right now.

The long term bear case is equally simple... bitcoin will not be a thing.  Crypto currency will fail entirely or at least bitcoin will fail almost completely and be replaced.  If so the value should approach 0.  There are reasons to think this could be the case.

The market will decide whether we are closer to a success scenario or failure scenario since the last decision point.  I have a pretty good guess as to which way it will decide and I am betting accordingly.",2016-04-02 14:11:32

https://brave.com/#about

&gt;Each mode has a different economic model and some bells and whistles: 

&gt;* For ad-free mode, you pay a monthly fee in Bitcoin (BTC). Once the BTC transfer occurs, the Brave Browser transmits an anonymous-but-accountable summary of your top 10 sites by weighted average

With a positive angle further down.

&gt;Each day, the Brave Ledger tallies up the payments and sites viewed and ""crunches the numbers"". The payments sum (less a nominal processing fee, say 5%) is then divided by the sum of weights in order to determine the payment ratio, and then the payment to each publisher is calculated by multiplying the ratio by the weight. 

This seems way too friendly towards ad publishers in my opinion. Users are paying way more than what its worth, and free users depend on other users more directly than a ""freemium"" (free but with premium benefits) online video game. The freemium platform is supposed to enable free players by broadening margins on a minority to increase profit and compensate. This is closer to capitalizing on people's fear of bad ads; ""Want a completely perfect, humble, safe, and fast browsing experience? Get Brave! But you have to keep paying us or you'll get fucked sideways by malware, trackers and more."" What I mean is someone is going to pay or hardly anyone will be able to use the protected aspect of the browser. It threatens itself to become a paid, licensed software already.

If everyone did this, the free and unprotected side of the internet would become like a dark net in terms of how unsafe you'd be, with absolutely zero support for privacy because it has no money in it anymore. I don't like this.

* Government started the ""social revolution"" in which the state was the main benefactor of a fuck-ton of social mission (food at ridiculously low prices, free Cuban medical care, among others). The high oil prices allowed to pay for all of this. 

* Government revamped the social security system, pensions payouts began to work flawlessly  (something that never worked in here, old people died without receiving their hard earned money).

* Chavez nationalized industry key companies (Telecom, primary industries, paper production, among others).
This is when things started to get out of control, the public deficit grew without paramount, 
the nationalized industries couldn't cope with the demand for goods (due to corruption, poor management and the fact that a lot of high level military officers were sent to administer these companies)
Government started to favor importations (almost the 80% of the goods consumed came from imports)

* So now you have a HUGE MONSTROUS public administration (government employs a lot of people), a high subsidized price controlled economy (cheap food, cheap electricity, cheap everything), Central Bank is printing money away to pay for everything. 

* World economy suffers in 2009, oil prices go low, my country goes to hell.

d1ng61i,port53,18,"Only if you go through an intermediary that you can trust to keep your data private AND actually give you your money back.

Bitcoin transactions are inherently not private, the way it works is everyone can see every bitcoin transaction ever made, that's the only way you can verify future transactions are valid.  If you send money from your Brave wallet to another wallet that you've managed to keep anonymous until now, everyone will be able to see that transaction and that wallet is now tained.  If later down the road your previously anonymous wallet is used for something the Government doesn't approve of they'll just ask the Brave people who you are.  In this case you have to trust Brave to keep you anonymous (good luck with that.)

Their 3rd party method would involve a broker that you pay out of your Brave wallet and then they pay that (minus a fee, of course) in to your anonymous wallet.  That transaction can no longer be linked directly to you, instead both separate wallets made transactions to the broker around the same time, along with hundreds if not thousands of other transactions.  A delay in the payout or splitting up the payout in to smaller chunks over time would decrease the chance of matching them up further.  In this case you now have to trust the broker to not reveal your information.  Of course, once the transaction is over they have no need to keep it so hopefully they are erasing it pretty much immediately.

BTW, thinking about this lead me to [this cool visualizer](https://gappleto97.github.io/visualizer/) of transactions, and it's a good demo of showing how a 3rd party can see each and every individual transaction in the bitcoin universe.",2016-04-03 07:36:32

If this is your security model make `CheckTransaction()` return true and blindly trust miners, because that's what you're achieving here. 

Do note also that all nodes running your suggested ""simple"" patch would be vulnerable to the quadratic hashing blowup, so would attempt to fully validate signatures on blocks which may take them minutes or hours to process.

&gt;And so what happens as the result of this capacity crunch? *We get better wallets*. And that's really the essence of a dynamic system responding to pressure, because as we get better wallets, these better wallets calculate fees more correctly, and it's a lot easier to jam the network if there' a lot of dumb wallets doing 0.1 mbit feets. Because then all you have to do is do 0.11 mbit fees, and you are king of the hill because the other idiots didn't update and you jam the network with your transactions. But if they're able to do 0.12 mbits, now you have to do 0.13 mbits and now we're in a race, and before you know it you're spending .5 mbits on a transaction which of course, if you're a legitimate user is nothing, but if you're trying to jam the network it gets really expensive fast.

Bingo. What an excellent talk. Strangely enough I was having almost this exact talk with myself in the shower this morning, at least, on the topic of how things grow to their capacity, and force that capacity to increase, then grow to capacity, and etc, over and over in many aspects of life. And it's that growth to capacity that even allows the progression and evolution to get to a point where you can do more and more interesting things with it. People act like bitcoin needs to be able to do the volume of Visa in it's current state. To use an analogy Andreas used, that would be like asking the internet of 1992 to run Netflix.

Classic requires 750 of the last 1000 blocks to be mined with it, and running at 10 minute confiirmation time that'll take a week to build up. Then once Classic's fork triggers there's a further 4 week grace period before 2MB blocks are allowed. So if the system is functioning well it takes a minimum of 5 weeks to get 2MB blocks going.

If Bitcoin is suffering from reduced mining rate due to miners leaving, extend those durations proportionately. A 50% miner loss from a catastrophic halvening means ten weeks until Classic can activate, for example.

The miners are playing a very dangerous game here. A collapse of Bitcoin can happen much faster than they can upgrade the network to fix it, they need to get ahead of these things preemptively.

d1o98ta,[deleted],14,"Sure,  but money is one assigned good in a linearly dependent goods,  price system. It is true that gold has been that good in the past -  meaning that all prices were relative to gold. But you can't have more than one money good.  When gold was the money,  banknotes were just claims on gold,  that's why,  in a gold nased momey system,  the banks had to have enlugh gold to be able to satisfy current claims on it in circulation. 

Today we,  in most parts of the world -  have a fiat/credit money system. We created an institution - central bank - and by law gave it the power to create money and take the Seignorage that comes with it (the profit that goes ot the creator of the money).  The central banks create money (cash and central bank loans to banks). And the banks create ""book""  money,  claims on money, that are almost identical to money but not wholly (its whats on your bank accounts or credit accounts).  I dont want to go into detail why it is only almost identical to money. 

So what are bitcoins and gold then in our system? It's simple. They are goods. When you pay in bitcoins,  you actually barter.  Bitcoins are only accepted as value because they are exchangeable on liquid markets against money.  I do know that bitcoins can be money - if we would unilaterally decide to make them our money, meaning all prices are now relative to bitcoins.  But that is the case for any good. Seashells,  stones,  cigarettes,  even manure.   They all can potentially be money. 

Now of course some goods have better characteristics to be money tban others. A good is a good money if it cannot be replicated easily by anyone and that is durable.  Thwre are other characteristics,  too. Gold was such a good in the middle ages. 

Because of the weak institutional environment in the middle ages in Europe and parts of Africa,   in which there was little control over the rulers and little security in general,  gold ans silver were good goods because rulers could not infinitely replicate them and enrich themselves by  inflation. I wont go into detail how this works.  However there was still the problem that one could surely fake some silver or gold or stretch it.  

So societies designated a ruler that had the monopoly over creating gold as money.  Thats where coins come into play.  Minting was an important right back then and ensured that the abbility to reproduce money was limited.  In return,  the ruler got the seignorage,  the profit from being able to create money. Nowadays,  the seignorage exists,  too and foes to the centeal bank and governments. 

Bitcoin is a lot like gold. It is not easily reproducable since you need to put energy and time into it and supply is limited. The seignorage goes to those who invented the system,  they probably have some stack of bitcoins on the side, and to those who are creating new bitcoins. But since it is a decentralized process,  creators are competing with each other (the more creators there are,  the more it will cost you to create a bitcoin) and the profit is negligible and depends on the number of creators.

So you see,  gold and bitcoins are fit to be a good money with some downsides but they arent in our system just as much as what you have on your bank account is not money but a claim on money (but this diffrrence will only matter if the financial system of your country is not very trustworthy,  meaning that banks are likely to not fulfill the claims you have - like Greece two years ago when you saw people running to the atm to get as much money out as possible) ",2016-04-04 02:21:52

d1pq6hj,roybadami,31,"**TL;DR: Originally I thought that this was intended to be a plan to smooth out the effect of the halvening on miner profitability, but it's clearly not (so I've edited this post accordingly).  Yes, what I _think_ Adam is proposing can be done as a soft fork.  It allows miners to delay the profitability shock resulting from the halvening by a couple of weeks, in exchange for lower profitability _now_.  Worse, this plan very likely results in an overall loss to miners.  So I can't see any value in this proposal - it's just an insanely complicated way for miners to lose money.  Comments/corrections welcome.**

Ok, so what he seems to be proposing is that 51% of miners could agree that they would temporarily only accept blocks if they had a hash value below an agreed target that is half the normal consensus target - i.e. that they effectively double the difficulty - and that they refuse to build on any block that doesn't play ball with them, hence forcing everyone else to do extra work as well.  This is indeed a softfork, since all it is doing is rejecting blocks that would otherwise have been valid.

For simplicity of our analysis, let's imagine that they impose this softfork suddenly all at once at the time of a difficulty adjustment (this is not Adam's actual proposal).  The net effect would be to halve the rate at which blocks are produced, which will cause difficulty to drop by a factor of two at the next difficulty adjustment.  (Note though that halving the block rate also doubles the time till the next difficulty adjustment - with 20 minute blocks then 2016 blocks will take four weeks, not two.)

It's a bit like all miners agreeing to turn off half their hashing power in order to reduce difficulty, except that it ensures miners can't cheat.  The problem is it also ensures miners are still paying the electricity cost corresponding to their full hash power - thus they are now making a loss.  The bigger problem is that with 1MB blocks Bitcoin won't cope well with four weeks of only one block per 20 minutes.

But anyway, if for some reason 51% of miners decide it's a good idea to impose this plan on the community, and the difficulty does indeed drop by 50% at the next difficulty adjustment four weeks later then their profit returns to normal (with the soft fork rule still in place - so still 'throwing away' half their hash power, but with a difficulty artifically lower than it should be by a factor of two - thus cancelling out).

Now, the plan is that when the halvening happens, the miners revert to normal consensus rules, using their full hash power again and thus generating a block every five minutes.  Again, for simplicity, lets assume the halvening coincides with a difficulty adjustment.  So for the next week their income is just as it was pre-halvingday - half the block reward, but twice as many blocks to collect the reward from.  But only until the next difficulty adjustment (which with 5 minute blocks will come after only one week) at which point things will, of course, revert to the post-halvingday new normal that we were always going to have anyway.

So the net effect is that in exchange for four weeks of poor profitability now (just as bad as post-halvingday profitability will be) they get to delay the halvingday by two weeks (due to the period when we had 20 minute blocks) and then delay the point at which the halvening hits their profitability by a further week.  So they get to lose more money than they would have done by doing nothing, and they get to lose it earlier than they otherwise would have done by doing nothing.  Not something a rational miner is going to do.

Ok, the above analysis is over-simplistic, because it assumes that the soft fork changes all occur at difficulty changes, and it also ignores the effect of profitability on hash power.  In reality, things would be much more complicated - but it would still almost certainly involve miners losing more money, earlier.

But anyway, back to Adam's actual proposal.  In Adam's actual proposal, instead of the above sudden decrease in target, you lower it very gradually over several months, thus avoiding the pain of four weeks of 20 minute blocks;  instead you could have several months with a block time only a little longer than 10 minutes.  You still revert the fork all at once, though, so that the sudden change in block time can balance the sudden change in block reward on halvingday.  Hence all you do is delay the inevitable by around a week (plus perhaps another couple of weeks due to the slower block times leading up to halvingday).  It _may_ be that in this gradual version the miners' overall losses from this plan are smaller than they would be in the sudden version I describe above (I'm not sure) but I'd be surprised if the losses are not still present.

[Edited significantly given it's clear Adam wasn't suggesting the effects would last more than a week.  So it's not so much that his plan doesn't do what he thinks, but more that it's pretty pointless to trade slightly lower income between now and halvingday for a slight delay in the post-halving losses.  Coupled with the fact that I strongly suspect it will lose miners money overall - although it would require a more rigorous analysis to prove that.]",2016-04-05 04:41:10

Bitcoiners talk about decentralization and using blockchains to replace people they view as unnecessary middle-men.  The absurd autonomous organization idea is an extension of that concept.  Bitcoiners mistakenly believe that most disputes revolve around inaccurately recorded information and somehow having a secure ledger to record transaction/contract details would solve most problems -  as if having an immutable digital copy of a document implies the underlying meaning could never be wrong or disputed.  This is laughable.

Contracts that are simple enough to be expressed and verified with code are usually not the type of contract that would need to be automated in a cryptographically verified way. But real world contracts are usually much more complicated and rely on subjective judgments.

Real world contracts also rely on information and understanding that simply doesn't exist within a cryptographic system. The only solution are ""oracles"", external services that provide inputs to the smart contract. But those services don't have any of the touted properties of smart contracts, so it ends up being nothing more than overly complicated escrow.

Smart contracts can be used for simple things like asset ownership (arguably every bitcoin transaction is a smart contract), but in the real world these things are just as well solved with cryptographic signatures and centralized databases, rather than burning a small country worth of energy or building some sort of horrifically inefficient global distributed computing system as cryptocurrencies do.

Of course there's also one major threat with every custom smart contract: if there's a bug, you're permanently screwed.",2016-04-05 05:30:48

d1s3saj,NightwingDragon,333,"They actually *could* deal a crippling blow to TOR if they really wanted to.

* **EDIT**:  While I mention Tor nodes and bitcoin specifically, I'm sure the legislation would be worded to cover all avenues and cryptocurrencies, such as Freenet and I2P which are mentioned in the article, along with ensuring that the legislation would also cover any future technologies as well.

Let's say someone in the US government drafted legislation saying that if you run a TOR node, *you* are responsible for *all data* that passes through it.  Slap all the right buzzwords on it (""protect the children from pedophiles"", ""fight terrorism"", ""war on drugs"", etc. etc. etc) and give it the right title (the Protect teh childrenz from evil bad people Act"") and you have a bill that receives wide bipartisan support from all the ""tough on crime"" people, which would be political suicide to oppose.

Would it pass a Supreme Court challenge?  Probably not.  But it would still take several years to even get to that point anyway.  During that time, nobody in their right mind is going to risk jail time and a lifetime placement on the sex offender registry just to run a TOR exit node or something, virtually shutting down all the non-government-run exit nodes in the US.  As other countries follow suit (and at least some, like the UK, would), more exit nodes get shut down, slowing the network down to the point of being unviable.  

Add a provision in the bill forbidding banks from dealing with any company that handles Bitcoin (A similar provision forbidding banks from dealing with online poker sites successfully crippled online poker in the US) would be another crippling blow.  You'd see the value of Bitcoin tank overnight since no bank or company would put themselves at risk over a cryptocurrency that would be demonized by the mainstream media (""Bitcoin is what the pedos and druggies and terristz use to commit crimes online"") and that only a small fraction of a percent of their customers have even heard about, much less use.

Keep in mind, I'm not saying I support these measures at all.  I'm just saying that while they may not be able to ""shut down"" the dark net, it would be trivially easy to deal a crippling blow with the right combination of must-pass laws and an easy-to-write smear/FUD campaign targeting the masses who wouldn't know a Bitcoin from a Chuck-E-Cheese token.

d1qtr1a,novablinkicelance,75,"Writing in English because many Americans might end up reading this comment.

Others have mentioned how impractical the wall would be for stopping illegal immigration and drugs, so I won't touch that subject.  Instead, I will focus on how unfeasible this policy would be.

To begin with, Mexicans could send their money to another country and then have it forwarded to Mexico.  Also, Mexicans could pay Americans to send money on their behalf, assuming that you require a valid ID to send money to Mexico.  Additionally, there are many ways to send money other than traditional wire transfers, such as Prepaid debit cards, PayPal, Bitcoin, having legal status family members carry the cash when they go back to Mexico, borrowing from a credit card in Mexico and paying it in the United States, and I am sure that there are more ways that I am missing.  How will you stop all these ways?  Furthermore, as soon as it looks that Trump might win, entrepreneurs in Mexico and the United States will figure out ways to be the first to come up with ways to make it easy to send money abroad so they will be the first to profit.  In addition, there are remittances to China ($15B), India ($10B), and other countries.  How will he regulate them?  Finally, Trump might not be able to pass a law making sending money to Mexico illegal.  If he does pass such law, then the illegality of the action won't stop it as you can see from the current drug and weapon markets.  Trump will create a new black market for money transfers.  As if the current black market for drugs didn't cause enough damage to both countries.

Another thing that Trump is not considering is the ramifications of such policy in Mexico, the United States, and the world.  First, assuming that Mexico gives in to Trumps's extortion, Trump gets his wall, which doesn't stop illegal immigration or drugs, and sets a dangerous precedents to other countries such as China and India.  Second, assuming that Mexico doesn't give in to Trump's extortion, what happens next?  What will 9 million of illegal Mexicans do when they can't send money to their abuelitas (grandmothers) so they can pay for their insulin shots?  Or when they can't send money to their wives to pay for food for their children?  Do we want to find out?  Losing the remittances, assuming Trump can stop all the other legal and illegal ways of sending money, would hurt Mexico, potentially causing more illegal immigration to the United States.  Assuming that Trump's wall does stop illegal immigration, what will happen in the US when it suddenly loses 9 million workers?  Finally, how will the world interpret this policy?  Mexico is, after all, the United States neighbor and ally.  If Trump treats his allies this way, instead of looking for a solution that wouldn't cause harm, how will he behave towards India, China, or Russia?",2016-04-06 01:07:19

d1rutq9,tsontar,63,"You're missing the Golden Key.

Once you have the Golden Key to unlock the secret of LN scaling, then it all makes sense.

The Golden Key is quite simple. First let's restate the problem:

It's true that you, me, and 99% of normal people lack the assets to simply lock all of our capital into various channels solely in order to scale Bitcoin in a truly decentralized P2P way where we have a P2P channel to everyone we pay. It's completely true that if only these 99% of people participate, then LN can never solve scaling because there could never be enough capital locked up in these channels to facilitate 10,000:1 scaling.

Moreover, it's very hard to solve the routing problem, because if Alice and Bob can only afford to lock up enough money to facilitate their channel, and Charlie and Dave can only lock up enough money to facilitate their channel, then Alice and Bob cannot find  routes to either Charlie or Dave.

Proponents of LN like to hand-wave this problem away by saying that the routing problem will be similar to the ""6 degrees of Kevin Bacon"" game, but they make a fundamental error which we can now explain:

The Golden Key is that Eric is also a participant, and Eric is a Bitcoin mega-whale, and he's *already* made channels with Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Dave. Eric is a central hub.

That's why ""6 degrees of Kevin Bacon"" works: Kevin has been in so many different movies with so many different actors that he is like a ""hub.""

If LN is to be permissionless, there's no way to prevent a megawhale from establishing himself as the ""center"" of such a network, and becoming a de facto central hub.

Now maybe Fran and George also have a lot of Bitcoin and want to be a hub. Unfortunately they don't have as much as Eric (nobody has as much as Eric - like all wealth, Bitcoin wealth follows a very steep curve where the richest person is a lot richer than the next guy, and most wealth is concentrated in very few hands) so even though Fran and George are able to establish themselves as hubs, they'll never be able to earn as much transaction fees as Eric, or reach as many users.

Consider Harry, who just bought his first 0.1 and would like to open a channel so he can transact over LN. He could open a channel with Fran or George, but why? Eric will always be able to offer cheaper transactions (with fewer hops) than Fran or George. If Harry is rational he'll choose Eric as his hub, as will Irving, Jenny, Katherine, Larry, Melissa, and everyone else in the alphabet.

Once you understand the Golden Key, LN scaling makes sense. And the Golden Key is simple:

**""The guy with the most gold owns the key that makes LN work for scaling.""**

Now place yourself in the position of a miner. Eric is virtually your only customer and represents an almost complete gatekeeper between miners and users. After all, the blockchain basically only exists to settle transactions between Eric and the other smaller hubs. And there aren't that many other hubs. Eric has *tremendous* power over miners. He might even be able to keep blockchain capacity artificially limited to mostly himself, so that onchain fees are prohibitive and LN alternatives lack capacity. He might even be able to contract with miners for a bulk mining discount, placing Fran and George at a terrific disadvantage....

It was definitely *incoming* rather than *outgoing* -- I'll attribute my minor panic as to why I mixed them up :P.

There was a UPnP entry in the router settings opening up 51869 to my address (which I'm sure was most likely done by aforementioned p2p client), in spite of my other settings. I haven't seen any new requests coming in since nixing the UPnP.

I'll be setting myself up with my own router in front of this one, as well as configuring this router to be a bit more secure in the coming days.

Anyway thank you very, very much. That is some excellent problem solving you've got there. You definitely put my mind a bit at ease.

It's true that Monero scales better than Bitcoin but doesn't compare to Visa. But I don't need my cryptocurrency to scale to Visa-land. I just need it to process my transactions when I send and receive them. I like low fees. I want a fungible currency with a reasonable degree of anonymity and untraceability. I don't want tokens in my possession to be seizeable because of 'taint'. 

I think it's probably true that most Crypto advocates get lost in the weeds, but I don't think that many of us forget why we're in this particular field. A staunch Dash or Ethereum supporter has more in common with a Monero supporter (in a world where one cannot support multiple projects; obviously many of us do this) than someone who sees no problems with a ""trust relationship"" with an institution like [pick your poison]. One problem with centralized, _trust relationships_ is the power dynamic that exists between a bank and you; Pleb. 

I agree with the original, original poster when they say ""cryptocurrencies... are only superior if you have decentralization as a requirement..."" which is definitely agreeable to many of us. 

So yeah, I'll take the accusation that I'm in the weeds. I know _which_ weeds I'm in, because I know why I'm here: _peer to peer electronic cash_. I DGAF about centralized trust relationships. I'll have more than enough of those to continue to have to deal with already in the rest of my life. Sure, I can walk into a _Too Big To Fail Except When They Will, At Which Point They'll Print More Fiat To Debase Our Savings Bank_, and beg them to give me a new chip card, which they will, but if they decide they don't like me, they just close the account. If they go bankrupt, it's all ""fuck you Pleb... aaaaaand it's gone!"" If the original original poster doesn't understand that, he likely doesn't understand a _great deal more than anyone has time to explain to him_. 

I am lucky to live in a country where I will likely not get hauled off in a black van because I type this. But not everyone is so lucky. Centralized trust relationships fail there. I bet original original poster has never had his neighbors taken in the middle of the night by the government. I bet the original original poster has never been told they can no longer access the funds in their bank for the foreseeable future, and then have that system fail on them. I bet they've never taken a wheelbarrow full of money to the store, which is empty, to try to buy the last loaf of bread. Sure, I'm drafting strawmen from all sorts of different scenarios, bigger than simply that of _centralized trust relationships_, and I'm preaching to the preachers here, that there _could be_ problems with the model of placing trust in an institution. It's happened, it's happening, it will continue to happen. I haven't experienced this myself, but I'm not so daft to think it's absolutely impossible here, or anywhere. 

The best thing I think some people can do to protect themselves from institutional overstep (i.e. the Washington Post just announced that for the first time, law-enforcement agencies seized more private property in the United States than burglars did) is to get involved in non-centralized, zero-trust (or minimal trust, anyway) relationships. Cross-border, cross-jurisdictional, open protocol _peer to peer electronic cash_. 

I prefer the concept of the _immutable ledger_ rather than an entirely spongy one. I prefer not being able to rewrite the database when it suits your fancy. I prefer the option of giving a view key (though part of me worries that while this might keep Monero from getting banned in some jurisdictions, the ol' rubber hose method of beating it out of you might nullify some aspects of anonymity for some people; but they could do this over cash, gold, guns, buried beans, etc.) rather than not being able to trace in any way, without WikiLeaks, where the billionaires are hiding their funds from the people they stole it from. As Obama said with an addition, this is a ""Swiss bank account"" in the pocket of _everyone_, not just the billionaire banksters who are running the show. The great equalizer. Potentially. Yeah, there's a lot of hype, but if it materializes, it'll be revolutionary in a way that a new Flash Pay With Your Visa So We Can Fuck You At 24% Option never will be. If a kid with a basic cell phone in a more-exploited country (what most people call 'third world') can have a way to save wealth and hide it from corrupt local officials (corrupted from afar by the exploiter-country's officials), then I say that's a win. Apple Pay can't do that. 

Sure, if my coins get hacked, I'm up the creek, but I can do something, maybe, to help protect myself. How do you protect yourself if you're relying on The Bank of Fuck You Pleb? Be a good pleb and hope they don't come for you?

d1tk627,Rbotiq,26,"Banks including J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and Citigroup Inc. have successfully tested the record-keeping technology behind bitcoin on credit-default swaps, a move that could help it gain a foothold in mainstream finance.

The swaps are essentially insurance contracts that pay off if a bond goes bad, and the process of keeping track of the over-the-counter products can be a burden. Banks match buyers and sellers, transmit the trades via a service run by data provider Markit Ltd. and send a record to Wall Street’s central bookkeeper, Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp.

The new test showed that a portion of that record-keeping task could be accomplished using “blockchain,” a common ledger that each party can view in much the same way that multiple users can work on shared computer documents.

DTCC will now discuss whether the results are strong enough to warrant using the technology for live trades or across a broader swath of credit-default swaps, a market with trillions of dollars in outstanding contracts.

“The ink is still drying on the results, but they are positive,” said Chris Childs, chief executive of the DTCC unit that oversees over-the-counter derivatives.

The test helps make the case for using blockchain in core Wall Street activities. While alternative currency bitcoin itself has been embroiled in legal battles and volatility, the underlying ledger—which can be edited anywhere and instantly validated—has drawn heavy interest from mainstream finance.

Big banks recently have invested teams of people and millions of dollars finding ways to apply private blockchains to cut out middlemen and save money. Barclays PLC on Wednesday announced a partnership with bitcoin startup Circle Internet Financial Ltd. to enable the digital-currency startup’s mobile app to send and receive British pounds and to swap them for U.S. dollars.

Analysts at Autonomous Research say using blockchain could cut trading settlement costs by a third, or $16 billion a year, and cut capital requirements by $120 billion. A recent report by Citigroup forecast that automation including blockchain could eliminate two million banking jobs, largely in processing, over the next decade.

The new test replicated a month’s worth of trades in the single-name credit default swap market, which has a total of $6.7 trillion in face value of outstanding contracts, not accounting for offsetting trades, according to DTCC figures. Electronic CDS agreements on individual servers were replaced with a record on a shared blockchain network.

The test included Bank of America Corp. and Credit Suisse Group AG, which worked with J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, Markit and technology firm Axoni, a new venture focused on applying the bitcoin technology of blockchain to banking.

Markit has about half-dozen active blockchain projects, but the CDS test is “the most real proof-of-concept going on,” said Jeffrey Billingham, vice president in Markit’s processing division and a lead in its “Chain Gang” testing blockchain uses. The test “revealed to everybody the ways you can improve efficiencies and minimize costs.”

Any live implementation of blockchain in swaps trading could be years away. DTCC says the next step is testing the appetite of other banks and regulators to use blockchain in the market. Some may be reluctant to make changes that threaten their own market share or introduce new complexity to current systems that have been tested and refined over the years.

DTCC, a bank-owned utility, will be an important player. It handles settlements for quadrillions of dollars worth of transactions. While bitcoin and blockchain were intended to eliminate the need for a middleman, DTCC has argued that U.S. regulators would likely still require oversight by a central body.

Regulators including the Federal Reserve, Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Securities and Exchange Commission say they are monitoring blockchain.

Last week, DTCC said it had separately started working with Digital Asset Holdings LLC, the startup led by former J.P. Morgan executive Blythe Masters, to see whether short-term lending arrangements between dealers known as repos could be settled using blockchain.",2016-04-07 23:36:09

it are also blockstream employees(lukejr) proposing to change the mining algorithm

d1ttxrq,cartridgez,17,"It comes down to politics/economics. Core wants an artificial fee market to develop. By keeping a low max block size people will have to outbid others to get their transaction on chain. Core says low block size is needed for decentralization so as many people as possible can run nodes and miners in China can mine. They want to deploy segwit (soon? this year) and the lightning network (few years later) as a hold over to increasing the block size. Lightning will still need bigger blocks.

The small block side is using dirty methods (censorship, bans, FUD, last minute 'discussion forum' invitations sent to big block devs so it's near impossible to make the flight [Coinbase CEO was able to make it - https://medium.com/@barmstrong/what-happened-at-the-satoshi-roundtable-6c11a10d8cdf#.6uascfv7n ]). Being unable to discuss bigger blocks on r\bitcoin created the initial rift. Stupid u/theymos. 

Classic (2MB then adaptive), Bitcoin Unlimited (adaptive), Bitpay Core (adaptive), want bigger blocks. Big block camp are about free markets and competition (they may not say so explicitly but that's what it comes down to). If you're a miner and can't compete in the price of electricity, bandwidth speed, or hashing power then tough luck. Core panders to Chinese miners who have to deal with the Great Firewall which slows their connection to the rest of the world. 

There is consensus for 2MB blocks from both sides (even Chinese miners can handle 2MB) but now it's about when it should happen. Core says segwit first 2MB later. Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitpay Core says bigger blocks now, layer 2 efficiency later. https://tradeblock.com/bitcoin/historical/1d-f-txval_per_tot-01071-blksize_per_avg-01071 You can see the block size average climbing. If you're a software engineer, you probably know that no system should be running at near max capacity as the norm. We have hit the limit a few times and Core says it's because of spam transactions (who has the right to decide what is and isn't spam if the fee is paid?).

A British meth vendor, who shall remain nameless, was following bitcoin stolen by silkroad2, his escrow, a week after MTGOX was robbed to pay for Satoshi's cryoghenic storage. It was while following the 2.1 btc stolen from him that the meth vendor chanced upon 120 wallets, all with a ""777"" payment from the same wallet - just like the ""666""ing technique he'd developed on the fly following the sheepmarketplace bitcoin the previous November.

He ""666""'d the wallet which belonged to the MTGOX thief, which must have panicked him. He knew about the British Vendor's 1Ah wallet, and had copied the technique.

The UK meth vendor didn't know it was MTGOX cash, he thought it was Silkroad2 bitcoin. He didn't know that silkroad1 and 2 were sister sites to mtgox, and used the exchange just like a hot wallet.

Then he sent a bunch of payments into the thief's wallet, to tell him who wanted their 2.1 btc back. Where 1=A, and 26=Z, a vendor name was spelled out in the thief's 1Nz wallet.

In the future, blockchain historians will wonder why somebody wrote  1 26 V E N D O R B B M C in the wallet  

I guess we will never know. Anyway, this musty have panicked the bitcoin foundation enough to try to hide the evidence by forking the blockchain in April 2014.

d1txk56,Ant-n,8,"&gt;* The other coin has massive scalability problems (sharding won't work unless you sacrifice decentralization, in which case it just becomes the world's most inefficient botnet for rent).

The coin with the biggest scaling issue is bitcoin.
It is still capped to 1MB. AFAIK no other significant  cryptocurrency got such little capacity anymore.

&gt;* The other coin has not been tested.

Monero for example has been attacked two times and recovered nicely.

&gt;Your crapcoin gets pump n dumped and you come here in the middle of the pump spamming your Jehovahs Witness technobabble lies while shitting all over bitcoin because it doesn't currently do something for which there is no demand (and it never claimed to do natively) and you expect people to buy your snakeoil?  Fuck off.

Well IMHO bitcoin is now the most experimental crypto out there. 

Believe me I **really** wished it would not be the case but the path choosen by the miner/core/blockstream cartel to scale bitcoin using unproven, untested 2nd layer solution and crippled main chain is nothing less than reckless.

This year will arrive ringCT/ring multisig and the official GUI. (And I believe the I2p native implementation will arrive this year too).

The goal of the dev team is to create the most perfectly fungible cryptocurrency possible.

Big potential and mostly under the radar so far because people are afraid of using the command line wallet (very easy BTW and that's the first time I used command line) so likely underevaluted until the GUI get released.

Fungibility/privacy I believe is critical and might the next crisis cryptocurrency will have to face (see the many blockchain analysis start-up poping out)

The reason it must be that way is so that in order to cheat the system and reverse transactions, you would have to expend a huge amount of energy (and money) to perform the amount of hashes per second necessary to out-compete honest players.

It could be argued that given the amount of transactions that Bitcoin facilitates on a daily basis as of today, the amount of energy per transaction isn't justified. The thing is, if total transactions were to increase 1000x this very moment (neglecting the fact that it isn't ready for that yet) the system wouldn't necessarily need to use any more energy to remain secure.

d1v62hc,ferretinjapan,18,"I agree with some of what you are saying but I'd like to offer a different explanation for why the price may rise significantly.

The halvening. Everything can be explained by the block reward halving that will happen in only a few short months. But I highly doubt this is ""moon"" increases, this is money velocity related increases. If I'm correct, then yes, there could be big gains in the near future, but it's not going to be a long term trend IMO.

Compounding that, I think it is stupid for people to buy in when this fiasco is still in high gear. This could have been a great chance for the price to remain stable and thus severely punish miners for refusing to increase the blocksize, but if people simply start buying because they fear missing out then Bitcoin is going to be staring down the barrel of a complete development monopoly, miner collusion/corruption, and the death of Bitcoin's decentralisation.

Tragically, and ironically, if the price surges in the coming months, then I'm probably going to be calling the death of Bitcoin as we know it, and likely the death of Bitcoin's decentralisation. There really won't be much left of Bitcoin after Blockstream Core and the miners are  done violating it.

Great, [I proposed that in 2013](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2013-May/002588.html)... But a more important issue today is that people want to reuse addresses. As-is, your proposal fails to support that. I suggest starting with BIP 47, making it sane (remove its required address reuse), and combining it with BIP 124 and your suggestions.

&gt; base58 is not trivial to parse.  I used the bignum library to do it, though you can open-code it as bitcoin-core does.

There's libbase58. Why didn't you use that?

&gt; base58 addresses are variable-length.  That makes webforms and software mildly harder, but also eliminates a simple sanity check.

This seems unavoidable. (Your own proposal in particular is also variable-length.)

d1w09ca,Bitcoin_forever,10,"Wow I was reading this article on ZH and then come back here to check the BTC news and saw this (same article). Man, is good to see that people are waking up.  
By waking up, few days ago I was talking with a bank manager in our local small community, about BTC. We met at a local bar and he came to me to ask why I didn't pass by the bank for a long time.  
My answer was this: because fiat is NOT accepted here and now I can pay my beer in this bar with my BTC. And I in that moment I just open my mycelium wallet and paid the beers (mine and his) with BTC.  
He was stunned, didn't know that the bar was accepting BTC. He know nothing about BTC.  
Then we start talking about BTC for another round of beers.  
We end up by him having 5€ from me in BTC in his new mycelium wallet and he paid with those BTC from me the beers.  
Now, the BANK MANAGER is asking me like crazy about Bitcoin, he is totally convinced now about the power of Bitcoin. He is a very smart guy but not a ""bankster"", he just have a job in a bank.  
Now we are joking to make a prank with a Bitcoin sticker on his bank entrance: ""Bitcoin accepted here"" just to see the reaction of people. He knows is dangerous and he can lost his precious job, but he also said: now I'm awake, I don't care, I have bought Bitcoins and my future is secure.  
I have convinced from 2013 until now 50 people to use BTC, 30 only in my small community (my landlord, 2 merchants, 1 bar, 1 banker, 1 policeman etc). We start small. For example only me, my landlord and some other neighbors knew about that the bar accept BTC, no sign no nothing, was just a treaty between us, that who have BTC can pay with BTC in that bar. Now the owner thing to put a sign out for the tourists but keep it simple.

d1x9one,grasshoppa1,41,"&gt; Ok so take any point of time when the major markets have a $50-$100 spread between them due to running more illegally then anything before.

What exactly do you believe is illegal about these markets?

&gt; Which value do you use? Average? One particular Markets value? 

Whichever one you want. There are legitimate reasons for differences in prices across different exchanges. Things like ease of conversion to USD, whether or not we're talking about a futures or forwards market, the country the market exists in, etc.

BTCUSD pricing is similar to Forex. Since there's no central exchange, each ""broker"" or exchange platform can have a different price. There's nothing illegal or illegitimate about this and is common in markets that are worldwide without centralization. It's not unique to bitcoin.

&gt; Very few entities exist in the bitcoin world that are not extremely illegal or compliant with any financial industry regulations.

Actually there are quite a few who are compliant. There are also many who exist in locations without regulation and/or who don't allow users in heavily regulated countries.

&gt; If you turned off all the bots(prime example is Willybot that moved the price from 200-1200), front running etc you would get a fair market value.

I'm not sure what your point is. Automated trading is not illegal. What do you consider front running in this context? It's not like there is any real HFT in bitcoin markets, so you should elaborate on this. It's a popular opinion but is largely myth.

&gt; So to prove the fair market value of a bitcoin surely you need fair market conditions which don't exist, if you go off a price at a certain point whose point do you use? 

I'd likely encourage him to base it on the Coinbase spot price at the time.

**Best Dark Net Market Vendor, Current or Previously?**

I know it's just another way to insult me, rather than an actual nomination. I'm used to the nasty shocks I usually get from former admins and moderators from Evolution, SilkRoad2 and Sheepmarketplace.

I'm used to abuse and a lack of recognition. I got nothing but abuse when I followed 96,000btc through bitcoinfog's tumbler because I ""only"" tracked it to BTCe. I had just invented the techniques used by forensic blockchain accountants, cracked a tumbling algorithm, and chased the proceeds from the biggest ever marketplace exit scam for 4 days without sleep, while you all stood around watching me. Every news outlet picked up on your laughter and I was treated like a joke. 

Then when Hungarian police arrested him because of BTCe, People forgot that it was me. How could it be? I'm a joke, just like meth. The only vendor to take meth seriously.

The same thing happened when I chased the SilkRoad 2 escrow. The only place I could publish my findings were AS A LISTING ON SR2.0 https://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/02/20/here-is-the-stolen-silk-road-wallet/

Using the marketplace to publicise its own crime. Defcon published a charity bitcoin wallet on his facebook which he had donated to himself, from the wallet we identified. He was arrested, now I guess he did a deal, got a new identity, and is trolling me and selling RCs.

You're saying I'm ""not a vendor"" because I don't need somebody else to look after my bitcoin wallet and host my listings and product photos. Its just motivated by anger, jealousy, and wishful thinking. I'm the only vendor with the guts and the long-term vision to take a year out from being a marketplace slave to do R&amp;D. Well, now it's done. I'll choose a small marketplace to work with, and they will be happy to have my name amongst all those square photos of every drug on their first page. I'm not a big vendor, but I'm an important one. The marketplace I choose will be an important one, because I have a reputation, rightly or wrongly, for not taking shit from a marketplace.

I was trolled to fuck when I pulled the plug on Evolution
https://pay.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2zc89r/complaintwarning_british_tor_vendors_association/

I wasn't even a vendor on there! But because I'm financially independent I spent 3 weeks investigating. Evo decided to cut and run 5 hours later, followed by NSWGreat, who was then credited with blowing the whistle by the no-longer-on-the-ball deepdot. 

He was the LAST evo admin to come clean. The whistleblowers were two German Evo admins. Erls of ToYouTeam had to promise them jobs to give them the courage to come out publically on 18 march last year. We voted on it, I fired a message off to Agora's boss out of courtesy to warn him to expect an influx, then I posted that. I only use the BTVA account if its been voted on, not for my own opinion. It always takes a year for a marketplace exit scam to unwind, but Paul ""Big Vern"" Vernon aka ""Verto"" is on the run in China over his ""Cryptsy"" exchange exit scam. Evo was tiny, one twentieth of a sheepmarket because we cut it short.

http://www.coindesk.com/digital-currency-exchange-cryptsy-ceos-wife-asset-documents/

there is a direct bitcoin transfer from Evo to a wallet, which is then joined by money he stole from cryptsy

https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/Cryptsy.com

Sheepmarketplace stole $200 million of your hard-earned dollars, and the unlikely team of me and gwern put him in jail. gwern doxxed him, I proved it by linking btce to sheep, by being the first person ever to crack a tumbler.

Since then, we had subpoenagate, the sub went private, fight clubs, ""open letters to BBMC"" from a female silk road forum moderator   https://pay.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/3mmpxr/an_open_letter_to_vendor_bbmc/  and good old umbreon, disgraced RC exit scammer who came back to do the longest Frank grimesing in history  https://pay.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/3yiv3w/an_open_apology_to_vendor_bbmc/

It would have been even more boring for me to answer every point in turn, so I created a black hoile and threw umbreon's comments into it, like any good vendor   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiMjB_yR20s&amp;nohtml5=False

Around this time, I was the only vendor who dared to hang around here, even the bravest US vendor, grandwizzardslair thought ""fuck this"" and fucked off. I stayed here having to go around with ""NO PROOF"" tattooed on my forehead, but it still didn't get rid of me.

I'm the longest-running meth vendor, the only Silk road era vendor to never get a disputed trade on a market. The vendor part is the smallest part of my time, because I make the highest-purity drug on the DNMs. And I invented the ""methporn"" genre.

- If you like software that doesn't scale, uses completely impractical trading mechanisms [try trading on augur right now, pre limit orders and see how useful it is, and that's _with_ a liquidity sensitive scoring rule, the lmsr is about 10x worse], and has an ""ok"" security model, feel free to use Hivemind, or fetch an Augur commit/version circa June, 2015 [which is quite close to their current whitepaper implementation] and get something similar [i.e. we haven't just been twiddling our thumbs since then, we've been working on fixing all these major problems].  You can build a ""95% there"" product really quickly; it's the last 5% that takes 95% of the time and makes something actually worth using.

- re UI, can't tell if serious or joking.  It looks good if the content on the left were an output of an RPC or IPC call [which it probably actually is].  It looks like Bitcoin core with RPC output spit out on the left [which is again probably what it is, since it's a fork of btc core]

* end expensive overseas wars and refocus the military on *defense*

d1xqrco,rawbdor,29,"One of the things you should be aware of is that once someone spends money from their account, they often send two pieces to two different wallets,  where the first transaction is what they're spending (maybe $10) and the second transaction is the remainder of their account (could be any amount, say $35000).

So for example, if you have a wallet with $35000, and you want to send your friend $100,  you will send $100 to your friends account, and $34900 to your own new account. 

Why do people do this?  Well, bitcoin has a public and private key system of course. The bitcoin address functions as a public key and an account number.  However, to SEND money, you need to use your private key to verify it's actually your account.

Many people don't trust their apps. Your private key was used to send money, and so they feel their private key isn't really so ""private"" anymore. So it's best to send all your money out to some new account number that's never been used to send money before.

Hence the need for guys like /u/vampireban to deploy this hideous tactic: pretending there has been a ""vote"" and there is ""consensus"" around the ""roadmap"" from Core / Blockstream.

So he's being quite subtle here. Core / Blockstream has not ""won"" - in fact, they are in serious danger of becoming just another competing repo (and the repo that almost killed Bitcoin, due to the congestion of small-blocks, the complexity of SegWit-as-a-hardfork, the centralization of Lightning-with-no-pathfinding, the confusion of RBF... the long litany of their fuckups).

So they need guys like /u/vampireban to keep on creating new accounts (his account is only 10 days old) and keep posting on r/btc and r\bitcoin - spreading their propaganda. 

This time, /u/vampireban is using a subtle but often effective tactic: trying to create the illusion that the hegemoney of Core / Blockstream is somehow inevitable, and we should all just acquiesce and accept it.

The French philosopher and literary critic Roland Barthes wrote about this tactic in his short essay ""Operation Margarine"" which appeared in his book ""Mythologies"":

http://paraphasic.blogspot.com/2015/07/operation-margarine-by-roland-barthes.html

The final sentence - the final word - is the clincher, where he talks about the temptation to stop fighting and just give in:

&gt; Here we are, in our turn, rid of a prejudice which cost us dearly, too dearly, which cost us too much in scruples, in revolt, in fights and in solitude. 

The mainstream media does this to us all the time as well. The protests against George Bush at his first inauguration were the biggest protests in American history. There were lots of people throwing eggs at his limousine. But the media didn't cover it - so it's like it never happened.

Guys like /u/theymos do exactly the same thing. They know that if you hide the dissent, then the dissenters feel alone - even though they might actually be in the majority. 

You see, this is what /u/vampireban is trying to do - trying to make people feel isolated and alone. 57 ""devs"" signed onto a web page supporting Core! So you should join them!

But the problem is, those 57 ""devs"" are not as smart as the market (which needs bigger blocks now rather than later) - and they're not as smart as Satoshi (who proposed a hard-fork for bigger blocks).

And those 57 ""devs"" are actually not even a majority in any sense. 

And most of them aren't even Bitcoin ""devs"" - just click on some random Github links in the OP and you'll see. Most of them say ""so-and-so has made no commits"". 

These are the phantoms who have created the ""dev consensus"" around Core's ""roadmap"".

So much of what r\bitcoin, Core, Blockstream, /u/theymos do (and the people who support them) is try to create an atmosphere of isolation, resignation. They try to create an illusion that they are in the majority. But who knows. If blocks filled up and we got backlogged for a week or so, we'd probably discover that Chinese miners still do want to make money, and people would simply install Classic or Unlimited, and Bitcoin would keep on honey-badgering.

The one thing that Core &amp; Blockstream &amp; guys like /u/vampireban want you to never, never remember is this:

Classic (and Unlimited) are already running on the network.

&gt; Be patient about Classic. It's already a ""success"" - in the sense that it has been tested, released, and deployed, with 1/6 nodes already accepting 2MB+ blocks. Now it can quietly wait in the wings, ready to be called into action on a moment's notice. And it probably *will* be - in 2016 (or 2017).

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/44y8ut/be_patient_about_classic_its_already_a_success_in/

That's Nakamoto consensus waiting in the wings, ready to rescue the Bitcoin network if / when Core &amp; Blockstream's plans cause congestion and crash the price.

d1zunov,Barry_Oners,22,"&gt;I read in your original post it says you gave people 15% off when using bitcoin. I think advertising this you opened up too many questions from customers because people immediately want more details when they see a discount they can't use. I think you should try again and leave it as a payment option with no discount. People who have it will know what it is and use it, others will ignore it.


this is so interesting. the usual response is ""you should offer a 5% discount for paying in bitcoin and then you'll start to see volume"". now it's changed to ""stop giving a discount"". just can't do anything right i guess...

d1z6imp,DSMan195276,14,"&gt; For someone to interfere with it, they need the consensus of over 50% of the miners to agree on the new block chain, which effectively won't happen .

This isn't really true for generic blockchains, which is what \_supert\_ is talking about. Bitcoin creates an incentive for mining by offering the miners Bitcoin in return for their work. This leads to the decentralized mining which is what makes Bitcoin tick - by being so decentralized, it in theory makes it very hard or impossible to get anywhere near 50% of the miners to work together to rewrite history, because everybody has an incentive to keep mining for the next new block. (However, with the introduction of mining pools this is actually a reality and concern for the Bitcoin network).

But mining costs money for equipment and power. Generic blockchains not tied to any digital currency have no incentive to offer to the miners for their work, so in turn there is no reason to assume they would amass a large number of decentralized miners willing to do work for no real return (I mean, they can always turn that power to Bitcoin if they want). Worse, another issue is that with less miners, you have less hashing-power over all. Because the 'global hashing power' is fairly high (With Bitcoin farms and such built, ready to do tons of calculations), blockchains which can't get a certain amount of total hashing power in them could be subject to ""drive by"" attacks by people who have more power then 50% of the network, which would be basically impossible to predict. The only way to prevent this is to have a fairly large amount of hashing already invested into your network (expensive) or use something other then the POW-based blockchain that Bitcoin uses.

Robin_Hook_Jr responded to my question saying basically the same thing - Basing the blockchain off of something other then POW. But once you do that, you basically have a situation like SSL, with a few trusted signing authorities that everybody else follows. And really, with database software and things like `git`, you can already do this (`git` history can't be changed without making it incompatible with the previous history. So for example I can't go back and change some code that was added three commits ago without it becoming incompatible with everybody-else's copy. Consensus with `git` is simply determined by having one `git` repo containing the code that everybody agrees is the ""correct"" version.)",2016-04-12 09:25:58

Introducing ""data discounts"" for some kinds of data but not for other kinds of data is meddling with the economics of the system. We should keep the economics as simple and easy to understand as possible. 

Changing the economics even just a little and even for only well intended reasons can and probably will have large random effects on the economics of the system. Bitcoin should have as few and small random economic properties as possible imo. So let's not ""introduce incentives"" in how to count the cost of data in an attempt to alter the behavior of the Bitcoin users. 

If Segwit is good, then the ecosystem will adopt it anyway. We don't need dangerous discounts to make that happen. It sets a bad precedent to fiddle with the economics arbitrarily like that.

RE: renting hashing power to ""force a fork"" :  That is the way Bitcoin consensus works.

The block size limit is a change that the economic majority has been SCREAMING FOR for a long time.

“It behooves us to make sure that any hard fork triggers in a scenario where it is very unlikely for any of this to happen . . . Triggering at 75 percent hashing power is not that scenario.”

75% plus a 28-day grace period is extremely safe.  Even Mr. Chicken Little Todd says in that same interview that there is only a 5% chance of anything going wrong (and I think he is overestimating that risk by an order of magnitude or two).

d210g9a,GrouchyOldGamer,43,"Hello all o7

I am the creator and owner of IWantISK.com .

I love EVE Online. Definitely the best and most complex game I have played. Second place is taken by Open Transport Tycoon Deluxe! (which we should play sometime!).

I love PVPing and killing my friends in games. It's what makes the game fun. The competition.

When this whole war started, it was all in good fun. I decided to fund just for the hell of it because what else could be cooler than being a bank that helped change the EVE universe? It took a lot of work to get where we are (IWantISK.com) and everyone that has grouped together has come far and done very well (Money Badger Coalition)! I will never take credit for the amazing talent in coordinating what these people have. I am not sure if lack of this funding would have changed the outcome and I don't think anyone will ever know. All I am is full of ISK, and have nothing to do with it. (however, we have experienced x2 persistent traffic on IWantISK.com)  

All of my attacks on my 'enemy' were in-game. (keep it classy)

    They stole from our bankers in-game.
    We asked for our banker's ISK back in-game.
    ISK request for 320b was denied in-game.
    I froze dividends in-game for SMA shareholders of IWantISK.com in-game.

This is where it starts to get interesting (and a little ****ed up).

    They use a friend of mine (only other admin) to gain access to server out-of-game.
    Server secured by me out-of-game.
    ANTI IWantISK.com posts about RMT arise everywhere out-of-game (oh the salt).
    Admittance of illegal out-of-game felonious activities declared by SMA.

After the out-of-game attacks and all the recommendations to press charges against the person who abused their server administration rights, I did the following.

    Did not press charges and kept it all in-game.
    Hired someone to hire mercenaries in-game. (a great lieutenant).
    Engaged the enemy in a war in-game.
    Plans were presented for funding a huge war in-game.
    My war was used as a distraction in-game.
    Bankers and I were like **** it lets do this in-game!
    Lieutenant does an amazing job at funding the right people in-game.
    The Imperium starts to take serious blows in-game.
    Boom Bam Boom Boom Boom in-game.

At this point Mittens, whom we can only thank for one thing (giving us a common enemy to rise against. So genuinely, thanks!) has started to get desperate.  How to engage a bank that does not have a physical target or territory to defend? Negative PR and other sketchy tactics. That's how.

    Lots of my personal info is shared all over the place out-of-game. (I'm famous!)
    My old company name is researched for info out-of-game.
    Laws about real-money-gambling are compared to IWantISK.com out-of-game.
    IWantISK.com being called a real casino to help bring down IWantISK.com out-of-game.

So the lesson that The Imperium is trying to show you here is that if you try to mess with them they will do anything they can to bring you down. Even seeking out-of-game methods to destroy you. Honestly, IWantISK.com is technically an out of game method, but we use in-game methods to engage the enemy. We still have to generate the ISK that is used. It's not like we print ISK.  We work hard.

I have spoken to my business law attorney just to recap on any new laws that might have come out  recently. He said I am in the clear. That the worst case scenario is a fine for not keeping up your business name.

At this time I myself am a sole proprietor and technically have no Corporation or LLC and I do not profit. Plus this is all a hobby to me, not a business. At this time I am NOT incorporated in FL (not that it matters). I reside in Illinois and am self employed in this state.

Fortunately, regardless of what state I am standing in or what state I incorporate in, IWantISK.com is intellectual property and is the same thing as any other simulation  game you see out there and thus considered legal.  Since simulated gambling (credits with no intrinsic value) is not illegal, any state I reside in or incorporate in would allow my video-game creations. With no profits it would be hard to say I am benefiting like most laws require.

IF Simulated gambling were deemed illegal due to real-world-value of video game currency you would have to say goodbye to an amazing amount of games you currently play, including but not limited to the following list:

    Star Trek Online
    World of Warcraft
    Runescape
    Zynga Games (Farmville)
    Habbo Hotel
    NeoPets.com
    All FaceBook Slots and casino based games
    Lots of apps for mobile devices.
    League of Legends
    Most Pay-to-win games.

Wow what a list haha.

In order for these games to become illegal due to gambling mechanics, they would have to deem that the currency in these games have a real-world value. To give a real world value to a currency you would have to be able to use said currency to purchase real world goods. BitCoin is a good example of a currency that was being accepted by businesses everywhere and the FBI decided to attempt to tax this crypto-currency. If a government deems video game currency has real-world value, most MMO's would become illegal. Currency would have to be reported as tax income/expenses and everything would just go inside out.

EVE Online Inter Stellar Kredits (ISK) are not real money. You may be able to add more credits to your account but that is the same thing as buying points for your farmville account on facebook and gambling on random tools and seeds in order to get more than the points you bought.

I am not coming up with excuses. Just stating some facts.

Even though I have been attacked out of game I will continue to keep this in-game and now I have a personal in-game vendetta against these new attackers (Goons). A bigger reason to fund even more.

I must say. I must have done something right, but I am not the only important target. I am sure I have no control of the momentum against The Imperium but I damn well will be part of it by funding it. Plus, The Imperium is a great name to destroy.

I feel saddened about the fact that this was brought out of game but hopefully nothing too time consuming arises from it.  I feel ashamed that a player in-game would even try something this sketchy but I am not surprised. It IS Mittens...

I will make sure to keep an eye open for other sketchy wrongdoings arising from The Goons and make sure the server for IWantISK.com remains secure.

 

P.S. It's funny, Mittens compared himself to Rome. Here come the Dark Ages!

P.P.S. Much respect to everyone in EVE. Even Mittens. It isn't easy to start something this big and keep it up for so long.

Fewer people using Bitcoin is a Very Bad Thing, and I still believe it is urgent.

Maybe once the Core developers are done adding thousands of lines of code to support the new features they want they'll get serious about on-chain scaling, but, frankly, I've lost faith in their ability to make wise engineering decisions. They are piling on layers of technical debt with increasingly complicated solutions to problems that have simple solutions (see the discussions around what the Core wallet would have to do to support replace-by-fee for a good example).

The trouble comes when you start thinking about the tradeoffs, oh well you break all the clients and you lose ASIC advances and you lose the developers and you split the community, etc. Suddenly the economic majority has second thoughts: well in actuality they don't really want to change the block size after all.

Gavin and Jeff have been saying that if people don't listen to them, Bitcoin will fail. Jeff recently said that Bitcoin would become no better than TOR if we don't allow it to expand to ""mainstream"" use cases like to assist Fidelity bank. 

Well for me, TOR is a role-model for Bitcoin. It's not a flashy startup, it doesn't have a million users or make a bunch of money for the developers of it, but it does one thing and it does it well, it's a principled project and I hope that TOR doesn't sacrifice its essential properties to get some more ""mainstream"" users.

Gavin has a definition of Bitcoin's mining majority that is out of line with Satoshi's concept.

Here is [Gavin on the subject of a 51% threat](https://bitcoinclassic.slack.com/archives/debate/p1457656138000734):

&gt; Any theoretical attack that begins with '51% of miners....' is just not interesting. 51% of miners deciding to be evil is outside the Bitcoin threat model.

Here is [Satoshi on the subject of a 51% threat](
http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/#selection-287.8-287.516):

consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest chain. Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them. An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back money he recently spent.

We have two separate and irreconcilable visions. The idea of the ""mainstream"" Bitcoin that sacrifices its property of trustlessness and decentralization to grow and grow at any cost. And the idea of the ""free"" Bitcoin that is relentless in its pursuit of a truly p2p currency with no middlemen.

Gavin has also never been polite where Peter Todd is concerned:

&gt; Maybe I don't communicate clearly enough, but much of the fear, uncertainty, and doubt about the block size issue comes from people like Peter who want to know exactly how technical problems that MIGHT come up three years from now will be solved TODAY.

Basically, Gavin is fighting a war of words and manipulation, when others are trying to do science. I challenge /u/gavinandresen to defend his illogical assertions that he blogs about, with more logic than ""I chatted with some economist friends about it"". Otherwise, all he is doing is repeating mantras like ""The incentives are very strong"" and promising to make Bitcoin great again, smearing his critics with ad-hominem attacks, and refusing to answer anyone in a fair and equal forum. He's refused to answer me many times, he's refused to participate in discussion on the dev mailing list, he refuses to talk to anyone unless they follow him. And that's a pattern of many years. And if you challenge him on it, his response is, ""life is too short to argue"". Well life is too short to pay attention to Gavin's cries for attention, in my opinion.

I love code, I have a natural aversion to centralized power (while I wouldn't consider myself a libertarian, I agree with many of Chomsky's left-lib beliefs), and I think we can always be improving on what we have today to create something better for tomorrow.

So when I heard about a decentralized currency based solely on an open source codebase, I was intrigued. I wanted to see what this ""magic internet money"" was all about, and figured the best way to learn about the *real* and *practical* uses was to actually... use it... instead of simply reading and posting glowing /r/thathappened posts on /r/Bitcoin. 

From the beginning I saw significant issues in the code but wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt (beta software is bound to have bugs).

Unfortunately, while my posts talking about the proportional proceeds from Bitcoin sales (thanks to the aforementioned wave of traffic accepting it generated in the early days) were constantly upvoted to the top of /r/Bitcoin, whenever I mentioned a shortcoming, I was downvoted and called a ""concern troll"".

It was around this time that I reconciled the fact that the people behind Bitcoin have no incentive to improve it and frankly, no amount of work on the code *could* improve it since it it so bloated, inefficient, and environmentally destructive.

On the comet, blockchain reviews are a standard method of choosing services.

It seems from your skeptical attitude that you will be a weak hand. Thus you may be reduced to spending nights in one of the many cube farms that dot the landscape of Satoshi's Comet, particularly the slums surrounding New Satoshi. Choosing a cube farm with the right mixture of safety, cost and convenience is a simple matter of checking the blockchain for reviews. 

Of course, if you happen to miss the review indicating that the cubes at a given farm are infested with deadly comet spiders, because that farm placed many favorable reviews of itself on the blockchain, this is your own fault. You should have hired a review review service to read the reviews and provide a summary review of the reviews for you to view, discarding the ones placed by shills, just as I disregard your comments, filthy buttcoiner. Naturally, you will need to estimate and pay a surplus fee above the base rate so as to automatically compete with any contract the farm might have with the review review service. The process of choosing a good surplus fee is outlined in the wiki.

Many VCs agree with him. The problem being that monopolies are bad for Bitcoin. A monopoly provides a chokepoint. And if recent history teaches us nothing, it's that no bully can resist a chokepoint. Even if you move your business to Panama or Switzerland, the long arm of the US legal system and its fixation on drugs and terrorism will find you.

ChangeTip was a monopoly of sorts. It's not hard to imagine that if the company actually provided a service where profits flowed more freely, that it could have become a major chokepoint in the Bitcoin economy. FISA orders. Large-scale thefts. MtGox-style meltdowns. The possibilities are endless.

&gt; BitGo is probably the best example of an obscenely profitable business model...

That's an interesting idea, but I've seen nothing to suggest that the company is profitable, much less obscenely so. It seems more likely that like other pure play Bitcoin companies, BitGo is struggling.

It's not clear how significant money will be made with Bitcoin, other than trading the currency itself. In fact, knowledgeable people have suggested to me that the only viable investment model is to plunk down money in bitcoin itself, then fund a deliberately profitless company that will build vital, decentralized infrastructure.

For many investors, that's a bridge too far. Either way, the stereotypical VC model of funding a startup, then exiting by its sale, doesn't seem to work with Bitcoin. In that sense, there may be no place for VCs at the Bitcoin table.",2016-04-13 23:47:16

As far as I can tell (and I have been in the Bitcoin space since 2011), very bad things can and DO happen once the one MB limit is reached (increased delays, rise of altcoins), 20MB blocks do NOT increase centralization (they've been tested on testnet), and a running minority branch after a fork WOULD be less of a threat than any other altcoin (in fact, it would likely disappear within the first day, except for Luke-Jr, he'd still be on it).

There is nothing about those three statements by Gavin that is controversial.

Yes, Bitcoin is running in a pretty solid way, plodding along as it always does, but it is being crippled by an artificial chokehold, and while the offchain scaling solutions are good, an increase to 2MB this minute would have the same effect, and if agreed to by Core would be a non-event.

Read that last line again. If Core agreed to an increase to 2MB, it would have THE SAME effect, and it would be a NON-EVENT. The only reason we're even having this discussion is because Core refuses to consider the increase.

So then we have to wonder why. Are they refusing to even consider an increase to 2MB out of a genuine concern for the network? Hmmm... maybe. But the problem with that theory is that you have tons (TONS!) of examples where Core devs have actually agreed to an increase, going back to 2011! Blog, forum and reddit entries all over the place, saying how non-controversial a block size increase would be.

That changed, pretty SUDDENLY, in the last year.

What else changed in the last year? Most of the top tier Core devs went on the payroll of Blockstream, a corporation whose entire business plan depends on providing a solution to the problems that arise from... you guessed it... small blocks.

The LN sounds impractical until you realize that it is essentially just a checking account.  I expect when the network and interfaces mature, your bitcoin wallet will simply have two accounts, like your bank, one for checking and one for savings.  The savings account is like your bitcoin wallet now.  Your checking account will manage bitcoin addresses and open and close LN channels in the background.  You won't even know you are using it.  The same will apply for businesses.  Once LN is worked out and established, I think it will actually be easier to transact in bitcoin than it is now, hopefully improving adoption rates.

I never believed Bitcoin would work as a payment network.  I always thought of it as a digital asset and hoped it would excel as a competitor to gold.  It is crazy to imagine the blockchain recording every single Bitcoin transaction worldwide.  That is massively inefficient.  Why does the purchase of a cup of coffee require billions of dollars worth of security to verify?  It doesn't, and Bitcoin could never scale that way.

That's the main reason I believe Ethereum will ultimately fall to the wayside. The team appears to want it both ways: a strong central steering committee *and* exemption from the scrutiny that other financial service providers face. Setting up shop in Switzerland won't help these folks if/when Ethereum begins to see significant use on the black market. They've painted a rather large bullseye on themselves.

Some view Ethereum's top-down governance model as a feature. In time, however, I suspect that it will come to be seen as a bug.

For these reasons, the idea that the optimal governance model comes down to forking makes a lot of sense. The ride will be quite bumpy, though. Bitcoin Classic is probably just the beginning.",2016-04-15 00:32:24

They talk about this very openly, be it about how wallet developers are never going to do what is 'right' if not pressured by assigned limits, or about how they are going to incentivize use of some transactions over others using new constants. Somehow they have convinced people that not changing the 21M limit does magically render the system anarchic, even though its sanctity solely arises from it being a measure against central planning.

I get the point you're trying to make, but that's a stretch to be honest. It would be different if you said 1,000 or 220, since those are similar magnitudes. But you really can't answer the question whether bitcoin is ""worth"" more than $5 when it's currently worth nearly 100 times as much? I don't buy that. Based on probabilities alone there's a much higher chance it's actual ""worth"" is $1k than there is that it's actually $5, if only based on the fact that the current fair price is $425. I get that we're speculating and that it's really a completely speculative asset, but I haven't heard someone suggest that $5 could be a fair price for bitcoin since the Buttcoin days, much less suggest that $5 and $1000 are equally likely valuations moving forward (given where the price is).",2016-04-15 06:07:00
d23qk44,arcturnus,10,"Over an infinite amount of time *anything* that has a greater than 0 probability of happening will happen (an infinite amount of times), so this isn't a convincing argument. For instance, there is some probability that all bitcoin miners will fail to find a block for an entire year. It is insanely small, but given an infinite amount of time it will happen an infinite number of times. Worried about PoW now? Didn't think so.

In this case what matters is the probability of something happening in a bounded time.

My gut feeling (never a good thing to rely on) is that the odds of those 250 validators being in the same legal jurisdiction at some staking period in the next 100 years is higher than the odds of all bitcoin miners failing to find a block for a few weeks in the next 100 years. But the odds of that happening at the same time that the legal jurisdiction happens to make Ether staking illegal probably isn't. Either way, the probability seems absurdly low enough, like the probability an asteroid will strike the earth in the next 100 years low, that it isn't worth worrying about. I think we'd see a bitcoin or ethereum address collision before that.

Even if there were only 2 legal jurisdictions in the world, assuming even distribution of computers and Ether stakers, we have a 2^-249 chance of them being in the same jurisdiction at the same time. Let's assume a stake period of 1 week, so 52 in a year and 5200 in 100 years. So n is 5200.

g(n) is then 1 - ( 1 - 2^-249)^5200

And this number is so small that my calculator fails, it is essentially a probability of 0. And this is just 2 legal jurisdictions assuming many staking periods (one a week) over 100 years. I'm not exactly worried.",2016-04-15 16:25:46

Once on the comet, they will experience the brave new world of blockchain based interactive tentacle porn.  This unregulated free market tentacle porn is a miracle of modern invention and it exists in basements of bodegas everywhere on the comet.  The concept is simple, you take ordinary tentacle porn, cast aside all societal norms, remove jack booted government intervention, and you get entertainment devices so lurid I dare not describe them here.  Lets just say many of the machines inject a wide variety of unregulated free market chemical compounds into *all* your orifices *at the same time*.

As I write this, Satoshi texted me to tell you that he is screaming back through hyperspace in his space ship to pick up the next batch of bitcoin holders.  You can be among those chosen to be delivered to the comet, but you have to have the private keys to at least one Satoshi.  When he arrives, your Bitcoin client has a secret broadcast facility that will send you message telling you were he parked.  Pack your backs, kiss any loved ones who aren't holding goodbye, and get your ass out the door--Satoshi doesn't wait around.

There will be a line in front of the spaceship for bitcoin holders to wait to greet satoshi and have their bitcoin hoard confirmed.  Take a moment to chat up the others in your line--conversation is easy as they are all highly intelligent bitcoin investors like yourself.  Once you get to the front of the line, you'll see Satoshi himself.  Shake his hand, thank him for his intelligence, and hand him your paper wallet.  He will wait for 6 confirmations before allowing you to board.  Once aboard, help yourself to the wild and crazy array of unregulated free market drugs, alchohol, and sex workers.  Enjoy your trip--you deserve it.

PS:  While they have toilet paper on-board the space ship, there is no such things as a free lunch and it is pay per square.  Consider packing toilet paper for the trip.  If you pack enough, you could make a few extra bitcoin selling some to other passengers!

d24zr6c,nullc,12,"RC2 was out for 4 days, the regular process for releases is a week after RC. I suspect the only reason that anyone noticed anything at all was because the decision to go ahead was discussed in Wednesday's public developer meeting.

Having a public RC binary is not the whole of ""testing"", it's an element of testing-- and while it is a useful one it's usefulness could easily be overstated, especially for smaller updates: public use of RCs provides insight on platform incompatibilities in under-tested configurations... but changes like this don't tend to cause any platform incompatibilities. Most commercial systems do not generally provide public access to release candidates at all.

The changes being released here have been in testing for _months_. Go look at the minutes from the developer meetings, say [October 2015]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3o7bi6/bitcoin_dev_meeting_in_laymans_terms_2015108/) ""Concerns whether CSV will be ready enough for release later this month."". Seven months ago there was serious discussion about releasing it six months ago, and concerns that it wasn't quite ready at that point. There has now been another half year of maturity behind these efforts and their release is overdue.

The complaint about version number's from classic's contributors is inexplicable to me. Bitcoin Core has a published policy of avoiding consensus changes in major releases. The motivation behind this three fold: (1) so people aren't pushed to take a consensus change just to get unrelated features, (2) so people aren't prevented from taking a consensus change because of incompatibilities or bugs in new major features, and (3) keeping them separate from major releases make them easier to back and forward port to many other versions. Ironically, the third is specifically intended to benefit software-forks and other implementations which might not generally be able to keep up with the pace of Bitcoin Core. ... the complaint is also inexplicable to me in that classic released a network protocol rule changing hard fork in a 'minor' release.

Disclaimer: this analysis assumes a reasonably stable BTC price (or calm rise) given that it's based off ETH/BTC.  If BTC rockets up or crashes, all bets are off.  I'm sure ETH/USD will follow a similar pattern w/ trend, however that pair does not offer us a historical insight into our previous bubble pop.

A few weeks back when I posted that were exiting the pennant, I stated that our bounce range was b/t .014 - .0185.  After watching the volume, trendlines and behavior on the RSI indicators, I feel like I've gained a little bit of extra perspective on the situation and have made an adjustment.

[Falling Knife Strategy](http://imgur.com/P5fown1)

Our green line represents downtrend from peak.  Our redline is downtrend from pennant.  One clue re the beginning of the bear trend as I mentioned in previous analysis, that the pennant was starting to form below far below peak with a bear divergent RSI. We have 2 downtrends to break -- green and red.  Green is broken after testing RSI oversold territory twice.  Between RSI oversold bottoms last year, it declined 34%.  This green trend strongly correlates with mid-term cloud trends.  Red is broken as we establish an uptrend on the RSI bottoms.  This trendline strongly correlates with daily cloud trend.   

Historically, we had a huge fakeout to .004 which bounced right off the red trendline and the daily cloud.  We bottomed back out and began accumulation phase.  This analysis puts a similar accumulation phase between .008 and .014 between now and July, which times with the halving of bitcoin and ramp up to DevCon in china.  I'd like to reiterate that the Ethereum tech is very promising.  I believe in it and I am holding a stash along w/ REP, MKR, DGD.   My trading stash is in BTC since .027 avg w/ the occasional swing trade.  There will likely be releases and exciting updates all year which makes me optimistic that price won't drop below .011 (34% below our first RSI bottom).

Have a nice day everyone.

I have been having some discussions with others on the board.  We have come to the conclusion to switch my charts from Coinbase to a dollar denominated, index weighted price average.

The folks at [BitcoinAverage.com](http://www.bitcoinaverage.com) have a complete history of such an average in their API.  I downloaded it and it starts reporting high, lows, and averages for 9/3/13 onward.  This takes into consideration the ""bubble"" to the all time high.

So far I've built the chart through November 2013.  It takes about an hour for six months, so I am going to focus on THIS for the next few days rather than do updates on the current chart.  If we move up into a new box I will report it, but that'll be it for a few days.

The benefit of using this chart is that when countries devalue their currencies and when one exchange does more volume, or if there is a shift in volumes, the report will reflect a better overall picture.

For some reason, I think there is going to be more currency wobbles in the next few months.

As a side note, I am looking at the dates from the big bubbles and I can recall these huge moves; going up $100+ dollars in a day.  Moving through $100s of dollars in a week.

I also went back and tracked my first purchase.  May 13, 2013.  5 bitcoin for $105 apiece.  My lowest purchase was $81.00 per.  I have have some of those coins.  They are on ice cold storage.

d25x83j,go1111111,26,"Core devs are very worried that ""the masses""/users will ruin Bitcoin due to their lack of technical understanding and/or lack of caring about decentralization. Some examples:

* Core devs are very worried about mining centralization, because they don't trust that users would be willing to hard fork away from existing miners if those miners abused their power.
* Core devs are worried about hard forks in general, because they don't trust that users would converge on the fork that they think would be best for Bitcoin.
* Core devs want to get users used to higher fees soon, because they're afraid that if users get used to low fees then they'll demand them in the future and insist that the block size be raised to levels that Core thinks are unsustainable.

So Core sees the masses as a potentially dangerous force who is easy to manipulate because they are uninformed. And they see Gavin (and Mike before him) as manipulating them with inaccurate info. So it seems like Bitcoin is under attack by people using dirty tricks (Gavin, and also VCs and corporations who allegedly want to ""take control of Bitcoin"" and ruin it). So defending Bitcoin with their own dirty tricks seems like an unfortunate thing that they have to do to prevent Gavin's dirty tricks from succeeding, especially because the alternative (according for Core) is the death of Bitcoin.

Note that I don't agree with the above, but it seems to be the Core narrative, and I don't think it relies on Core being evil -- just elitist and a bit paranoid about users/corporations.

d279rum,xxDan_Evansxx,21,"There are deep pocketed bulls.  There is more than enough money.  I believe there is very big money which is perfectly content to keep the price as low as possible as long as possible.  Many times the long term large scale bulls and the short term short traders are pulling the same way.  It's amazing to me how skillful the accumulation has been, and it's amazing to me how many can't see it for what it is.

I watch the price action all the time.  I think you do as well.  Ask yourself how often there are big market sells into thin order books at weird times.  How often are there buys like that?  The organic action vs working the market... it's obvious really...  still have to respect the price action both ways, but in the long run...  What if a big bull decided he's got enough and he's ready to nudge it along?  What if we get the ETF?  What if core gets segwit done and then follow through with a blocksize increase and all goes smoothly by the end of the year?  By the way, the supply decrease will have impact.  That many coins not being created and sold daily will make a huge difference.

I only have to ask myself 2 questions.  Will cryptocurrency likely be relevant long term?  If so, is bitcoin likely to be a significant player?  If yes, this is super cheap.  $6B is really nothing at all.  It's hard for real money to even attempt to move in and out.

After a consolidation like this I really believe it makes sense for bitcoin to either trend down to double digits or up to four digit prices.  I can absolutely see bitcoin under $100.  But knowing what we know now it's hard for me to see that as the decision the market will make now.

You posted about how bearish the commentary becomes after a mild pullback.  It's not just then, it's pretty constant, and you do it too ""looks like double top"", ""who is going to make it go up?""  Who made it go up from $220 to $420?  These message boards and trollboxes are very consistently very negative and the community has been extremely negative for many months including more than one key developers talking about selling all their coins, etc.  Yet we are clearly in a bull market and have been for some time.

We are possibly dealing with a tremendously under priced asset (or an overpriced fad nerd token... those are the choices really).  Don't worry about the money.  Bitcoin isn't a secret and it hasn't been rejected by the market at all.  It's still tricky to get real money in... but there is more than enough.  One hedge fund could basically pop bitcoin if it decided to do that.

I'd rather see slow price growth anyway, so if people get scared into selling along the way for some of the silly reasons that are posted here or because of pullbacks along the way, that ultimately will probably help me anyway.

Keeping unlicensed content on FAKKU while we transitioned into full legitimacy was a planned move from the start. If we had removed all of that content too early in the process, we would have lost the majority of our userbase before we had an adequate amount of content to keep them interested and supporting our goal. If that had happened no one would have benefited, least of all the artists in Japan. That said our partners, the artists and publishers, were okay with this transition and were involved in it from the start. Their opinion on that matters the most.

It can be argued it's not what you're promising with simulpublishing. Do you want to change that, and if so, what would be the timeframe for that?

We have no plans to change the way we distribute the magazine content, I think daily releases is the best way to go (especially as a user myself). I think in the long-term we will move away from the concept of a ""magazine"" release, and more towards there being a library of constantly updated content where you care less about which particular magazine it's from. But I'm still figuring out what FAKKU will look like a few years from now.

&gt;A lot of your content is very vanilla. Extremely vanilla, a lot of the stories are bland when you read a near identical story right after it. You said you were not afraid to post ""extreme"" content, yet I can count the loli stories you've done on one hand, and we've yet to see NTR². What gives?

Vanilla is the most popular genre by a massive margin. We have years and years of data we use to make informed decisions on what to do publish and how to publish it. FAKKU was always meant to be a more vanilla site than others you might find on the depths of the Internet, and that's okay. If there are genres I think we need more of, it's futanari and yaoi.

d27ad21,jhaand,15,"I think my [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/48qxt3/im_in_guys/d0ltxdw) from around 1 month ago still stands. Although everything still moves slower than I want.

Copied for lazy people:  
To give you an analogy to the whole Bitcoin mess.

Around 10 years ago there was this big discussion in the Linux world for using which graphics infrastructure between Xfree86 and X.org. Xfree86 came straight out of the 90's and wouldn't innovate. Therefore people forked to X.org and the shit storm around that was humongous. Not unlike the discussion we see today.

As soon as X.org got any traction with the linux distributions, most of the Xfree86 project collapsed. And that's only one example on how quality will win with open source. 10 years onwards, the whole X-protocol is getting a bit stale and needs replacement. These replacements have been under development since the original fork. They're only now starting to deliver. But they don't offer the same amount of advantages over X.org any more. Because X.org has also been innovating the past 10 years. So it will take a long time before people will migrate.

How does this translate to Bitcoin?
Now with Bitcoin we have a peculiar situation. A lot of people have invested in the protocol and technology. Also the miners have invested a lot of work and money in ASIC miners. Making it still the most secure crypto currency on the planet. Which can't do a whole lot else than mine bitcoin. It's very hard to move all that investment of time and equipment to an alt-coin. On the other hand it's very easy to adapt the current bitcoin protocol to current events. People know bitcoin and the miners can still mine.

Just sit tight and watch the fire works.

d26pwvi,todu,13,"&gt; This is the reason why it's impossible to assume good faith anymore.

**Bitcoin was not built on the principle of assuming good faith. Bitcoin was built on the principle of assuming bad faith and that the system will work anyway.**

Everyone should be suspicious of a person or company that is changing how Bitcoin works in an unpopular way who / which then says that everyone ""should assume good faith"". Bitcoin only works if the majority constantly assumes bad faith. That's why you can't for example send a transaction that is unsigned. You assume bad faith which means you must enforce the rule that every valid transaction must have a valid signature attached to it.

In my mind, assuming good faith would mean that no one should complain about a change to Bitcoin where an unsigned transaction would be considered equally valid to a signed transaction. **So it's not only *ok* to assume bad faith - we *must* in fact assume bad faith or we would likely end up with a change to Bitcoin that kills the project. Bitcoin *depends* on assuming bad faith.**

Not every change is bad. But we should certainly be skeptical and *assume* that every change is bad. So ""assuming bad faith"" is actually a good thing to do. It's nothing personal. Just a necessity and it does not apply only to changes that Blockstream wants to make. It applies to every proposed change. **That's why we have a built-in miner voting system for changes.

&gt;Perhaps ironically, the entire reason I launched Coiledcoin in the first place was because I saw that P2SH was **turning into a fiasco** and didn't expect it to launch any time soon in any form - and it would probably have failed to do so even without Luke's meddling. Gavin was doing the equivalent of a hairpin turn in a supertanker and his code kept turning out to have bugs that would cost miners money, and **none of the reasons for the last-minute change or the rushed schedule were terribly convincing**.
&gt;
&gt;It's actually gotten worse since then. **gmaxwell keeps accusing anyone who dares to tell end-users about any of the technical details of spreading FUD by drawing the users' attention to something that's none of their business and is trying to shut them up**, whilst spreading his own fricking FUD about Luke Jr's proposal (no it doesn't reverse the bugfix that evaluates scriptSig and scriptPubKey seperately rather than appending them, nor can it cause the kind of security vunerabilities that split protects against). Gavin claimed that Deepbit was somehow attacking Bitcoin by not immediately adopting his buggy code, despite the fact that hardly any of the other pools had either, in an attempt to force Deepbit to do so and use their hash power to force all the other pools to follow suit. And so on and so forth. Luke's actually been polite by comparison and frankly that's _scary_.

Was that written four years ago, or yesterday?

Reading that thread again, several things several things pop out:

* Now that we know where the soft fork rabbit hole ultimately lead, it was a mistake to deploy P2SH that way
* The predictions about multisig not being as necessary (or effective) as everybody hoped turned out to be right (there's still relatively low usage of it today)
* Neither Luke, nor Greg, nor Gavin are particular good at leading or qualified to lead software projects
  * Gavin is the only one who admits it
* The problem of a single reference implementation being mistaken for the protocol itself was recognized as a problem then, and it still hasn't been fixed.",2016-04-18 11:23:21
d2797kx,Red-Menace-1917,10,"Basically what ""crony capitalism"" is defined as is the government giving contracts to firms and shady dealings and whatnot. Think of the Petrobras scandal recently in Brazil. 

  Anyways in their minds, the government ruins creativity and the chance of innovation brought on by capitalism, by crushing businesses that threaten their ""cronies"" (hence the name crony capitalism). 

  They believe that a lack of government oversight into the market economy is ideal, as this would allow things like startups and new firms to do jobs more efficiently than the current bloated corporations who have no incentive to be good at their manufacturing their products or the services they provide since they are guaranteed a paycheck. 

  And perhaps there is a degree of truth to this, however the right libertarian (or classical liberal as they are sometimes called or the anarcho liberals, anarcho capitalists, etc.) believe that the government should be reduced or even completely eliminated and that the free market, free from intervention of any kind should dominate. However there is usually one ethical rule in that everyone should respect the rights of others (the non aggression principle or NAP) and no one should try and kill and hurt anyone.

  However we run into issues with this. One is that if I wanted to sell a living human being as a slave who should stop me? One might say, ""well this clearly violates their golden rule, so we should stop you from selling slaves"" However this is now violating my rights to sell humans. So what should we do? Remember we can't violate anyone's rights, including mine. So the slave is now just an unfortunate accessory. 

  Okay so maybe let's say we change the rule a little, ""No unprovoked (opposite of tit for tat) active aggression, we respect everyone's rights, but if you exploit other human beings then that is when your rights end."" Alright seems good right, but this is under a capitalist model, so let's see if we can even do this. 

  The ultimate goal of every company is to make a profit. The anarcho liberals believe that the profits are property of the corporation and that taxes exploit and are theft of the company's property. If I am a worker I am paid a wage for my labor. However the wage I am given is less than what I am worth (because the corporation's ultimate goal is to make profits). They cannot pay me a truly fair wage in proportion to how much labor I generate. If taxing companies out of their profits is theft, then how is paying me below my worth not theft of my labor? How is the property that I produce that is magically not mine any more, not theft of my own labor? The diamonds that workers mine are not theirs, the houses they build are not theirs, the clothes they make are not theirs, etc. that is all private property, despite them working and making it it is not theirs. That is theft. That violates our rule of not exploiting people, because capitalism is inherently exploitative. 

  So can it be justified that I could have slaves using anarcho liberal ethics? I think it can be, and that's not good at all. 

  The other moral issue is that even if we pretend that slavery will never happen, the whole point of this was that so companies could have freedom to prosper. However this really just allows monopolies to flourish and for small businesses to be killed off. 

  So let's say we did it, we overthrew the government (and somehow our FIAT currency is still worth it's same value for some reason). Companies pre sans juris still have all those resources and money. Now they literally can do whatever they want without any fear of repercussions. If a small business wants to compete against them, they could 1. Force them to sell their business to them, 2. Flood the market with goods and services at cheaper prices that they cannot compete against and then go broke, 3. Buy out their main suppliers or do number two or a combination but targeted towards their suppliers. 4. They could even legally use extortion or force if they wanted to. The NAP could be used against these people as their business is threatening their ""right"" to do business. They could literally claim self defense and it wouldn't matter. 

  Other issues are the FIAT currency thing that I mentioned. So as of now all of our currency is backed by government issued greenbacks. Once that government is gone, this money is worthless. It was always worthless, but because we believe it to be worth something it is. Without the government inflation will probably skyrocket and eventually all money will approach a near zero value. Mega corporations will see all of their assets vanish overnight. There are two anarcho liberal solutions to this issue. One is commodity money, like say cans of tuna. A can of tuna is intrinsically worth something, you can eat the tuna. However this is pretty inefficient in capitalism, and can cause problems with high population making money worth too much (population can grow indefinitely, however tuna is a pretty limited resource, already overfishing is affecting tuna populations, thus in our senario there wouldn't be enough tuna for everyone therefore increasing the value of a single can of tuna to possibly crazy amounts like $100k). This can be a really big problem as how do you divide a can of tuna to buy smaller goods and how can you pay anyone to do services that aren't worth a can of tuna? 

  The other anarcho liberal solution is to use crypto currency like Bitcoin. However there's issues with this, as it is mainly a form of stocks and not an actual currency. In that you're not investing in a company but an idea. And if everyone decides to not do it, then all of your money is gone. It is increadibly unstable, and already 1 Bitcoin is worth $432. Now we have the same exact issue as the tuna can problem, where money is worth too much. 

  What fiat currency does (using the Federal Reserve) is increase or decrease the money supply to prevent rapid inflation or deflation. However wirhout this authority of government there is no regulatory agency for this and thus currency in anarcho liberal world will be crazy and all over the place, basically becoming worthless. 

  Capitalism needs government, the anarcho liberals saying ""end the fed"" (I am aware that the Federal Reserve is technically not part of the US Government however it still has to obey US laws and its board of Governors are appointed by the president and voted in by the senate, so it's quasi government at best) are ignorant to the fact that this would effectively destroy capitalism, the very thing they cherish. Also going to the gold standard would have the same effect as the tuna can problem because there is a limited amount of gold in the world and an ever growing population. To have that as your only currency is a dumb idea. 

  So basically they recognize the errors of the current system and their solution to it is to create an even worse effect. Capitalism is inherently evil and eliminating possibly the one shitty safeguard that the public has from it is pretty stupid. Ironically also, all of their policy ideas wouldn't benefit anyone including capitalists as it will completely wipe out their credit. ",2016-04-18 15:43:08

d28fl1r,cryptowho,14,"which part did the multiple sources verified exactly? because that article has a lot of innuendoes claims. including bribing.

I was not aware of such meeting and i would assume majority of people in the space were not. This could have been an opportunity to inform us of this event. This was a bad piece of reported journalism and if you read the article before being posted than you partake on the drama this is causing. No way was this informative. This comes up very biased towards mocking the classic effort. At this stage, all bitcoin related services should help minimize the drama between both communities and not fish for click bait articles. 

ill try to break it down a bit for you on point where this article should have been halted and rewritten to stay neutral. 

&gt; to adopt BIP 109 without the blessing of Bitcoin Core

Blessing of the Bitcoin Core? Blessing? 

&gt; The supporters of an increase in the block size limit also discussed a possible crisis that could ensue if the limit was not raised before the upcoming block reward halving

A topic that has been brought up by both side extensively. Yet this is portrayed as ""The supporters"" tried fear mongering tactics

&gt;Bitfury CIO Alex Petrov and others (who preferred to remain anonymous) have confirmed that anyone perceived to be associated with Bitcoin Core was not invited to the meeting. This includes Bitcoin Core contributors and various supporters of the Bitcoin Core roadmap. For example, Petrov was explicitly told that he was not allowed to enter the venue where the meeting was held until the discussions were over.

If your journalist published this, then you will need to release the statements and the names of who said it. This are serious accusation. when you knew about paragraph was going to be made public then you should have asked to provide facts. Who organized the meeting? Who was it and why did they not wanted to invite the core Devs? Where the participants in the meeting(the pool operators/miners)  aware that no core devs where invited and were they still okay to show and hear the classic supporters? Because it makes it sound like it was very sleazy and they were ganged up/cornered by classic supporters

&gt; This is a similar setup to the meeting that took place in Hong Kong earlier this year between supporters of the Bitcoin Core roadmap and the Chinese mining community, although BTCC COO Samson Mow, who put that meeting together, told Bitcoin Magazine that FinalHash CTO Marshall Long was the only individual who was specifically not wanted at that event. Having said that, Bitcoin Classic supporter Peter Ng did attend the Hong Kong meeting.

To not contradict itself, the Journal pointed out that the previous meeting, Samson Mow allowed classic supported to come and no way it was organized the same way that this meeting was. Which not to bring a lot of drama but it was not the case. 

&gt; The details of exactly what was said during the meeting are still relatively unknown to outsiders at this point, but sources claim that one end result of the event is clear: Representatives of the Chinese mining community have no intention of deviating from the previous agreement made in Hong Kong as long as Bitcoin Core continues to implement improvements for scaling

it would seem that this is the only part where most of your sources agree and most likely the only legitimate claim. Which was probably the real information to take from this meeting. everything else most likely is biased opinion from your journalist. 

&gt;Mow, who has spoken with multiple individuals who attended the meeting, told Bitcoin Magazine:
&gt;    “Basically, [the BIP 109 delegation] came over with an arrogant attitude and tried to dictate who could and could not attend. They were not able to present a convincing argument, and the general vibe is that they’re going nowhere. ‘Train wreck’ would be a suitable term to describe their efforts in Beijing.”

And this is where the article should have definitely been rejected. From now on is mostly opinions of Samson Mow from sources that he heard it from.. The guy that been trolling bitcoin space for months now is the main source of your piece. Welp, let us continue on this break down and see what other idiotic things of his are published here.

&gt; In addition to Bitcoin industry executives, such as the CEOs of Blockchain and Coinbase, at least one developer attempted to convince miners to increase the block size limit via BIP 109. According to sources, that developer was Gavin Andresen, who authored the improvement proposal.

is this out of context? was Gaving there and tried to convince the miners on that meeting as well? because that is what is sounds like. Gaving was there to try to convince the miners once again. Oh Gaving, you sneaky sneaky you!

&gt; There are also rumors that miners may have been offered extra money to abandon Bitcoin Core for Bitcoin Classic. According to an anonymous source who was at the meeting, money was discussed, but it was in the context of protecting the network after a hypothetical hard fork had been activated. Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd recently claimed these sorts of discussions have happened in the past. Andresen responded to Todd’s statement on Reddit. He commented:
“That is the way Bitcoin consensus works. Majority hashpower wins, unless they try to force through a change that is rejected by majority economic power (exchanges, merchants, users). The block size limit is a change that the economic majority has been SCREAMING FOR for a long time.”

&gt;  There are also rumors that miners may have been offered extra money to abandon Bitcoin Core for Bitcoin Classic. 

An other huge statement that shouldn't have been posted unless there are facts to back it up. Especially when it is quickly debunked by the following sentence. And then followed by pointing out that even peter todd has recently claim that the discussion to take action to protect the network financially. Thus a common topic was discussed. Why open the paragraph this way? extremely unprofessional. 

&gt; Since the vast majority of hashing power would like to honor the previous Hong Kong agreement and stick with Bitcoin Core, it appears that the only hard fork in Bitcoin’s near future is going to come from Bitcoin Core developers.

This silly statement wouldn't have been a problem were it not for the other ridiculous things posted. Do you have a magic ball?  You can see the future ahead? Ballsy claiming once again.

&gt;For the supporters of larger blocks, the goal is to get an increase in the block size limit before the upcoming halving in an effort to avoid a possible “doomsday scenario.” Whether this goal will be achieved remains unclear 

Try again.

This reduces Bitcoins onchain liquidity that greatly allows Fiat Whales/Printers (Banks)  to control the Bitcoin market just like they control the rather illiquid precious metal market today by issuing liquid paper contracts on the illiquid physical asset. The contracts are then mostly ever redeemed in Fiat instead of the asset itself because of the illiquidity and transport/storage costs (similar to onchain fees). 

Thus **liquidity is key and we need to keep Bitcoin as liquid as possible** in order to compete against the Fiat money empire. Endless liquidity is and was Fiat money's killer feature. Offchain scaling like LN and sidechains are only required to enable micro payments in the order of the current onchain fees.

Sadly the developers that push for offchain scaling do not know that they are being used by the powers that be.

This is a criticism of someone thinking in the bitcoin mindset and a terrible ethereum developer. You can create a simple generic contract that sends funds to an array of addresses and reuse that how many times you want.


    function sendToMany(address[] recipients) {
        for(uint i = 0; i&lt; recipients.length; i++){
             i.send(msg.value/recipients.length);

d297mw3,ForkiusMaximus,13,"Pursuant to another mini-debate on /r/Bitcoin the other day, I think the term ""centrally planned"" throws people off. They miss the point and respond, ""Well it has to be planned by someone."" 

This is where F.A. Hayek would note that something can be the product of human design without placing any one person or group in a unilateral position to implement their specific design. In other words, you can have many designs and let the market choose among them. Then it is planned but not ""centrally"" planned.

The SegWit rebate could, for instance, be set at various levels by various implementations (Core at XX%, Classic at YY%, Unlimited at ZZ%) and the market could choose its favorite (via fork arbitrage, fork futures, or even informal coordination with miners if the matter is not too controversial; deep controversy could end up requiring fork futures/arbitrage to resolve). 

Then, to be sure, *someone's* design got chosen, but the designer had no way to force that on anyone. Their design merely coincided best with what the market wanted - a decentralized process, even though some might want to call it ""centrally planned"" in some sense since ""one guy planned it."" The difference again is that it's not like one guy or one group was put in charge and we had to accept their plan. The market instead chose their plan from among a selection of plans. (One could say this is what makes it not a ""central"" plan, but apparently many people miss this all-important nuance.)

Now there are two ways to interpret this with respect to Core. 

1) Core has control and is centrally planning in the usual sense, like a government would.

or

2) Core's control is illusory because they'll simply be forked off if they fail to deliver capacity in time, so despite the way they present their plans and the way they vilify non-compatible alternative implementations like Classic, they are simply wrong about how Bitcoin as a whole works as a market process: just because they think and act as if they have some central planning power doesn't mean they do. Nevertheless, it wastes everyone's time for Core to act this self-contradictory way (as if they are both central planner (""Classic should be banned!"") and not central planner (""We're not!"")) so it should be pointed out, even if there is no actual danger in the long run.",2016-04-20 03:43:32

d299g59,eragmus,12,"&gt; *""Segwit gives 75% fee discounts to special bytes so it restructures the economics""*

And, in so doing, it achieves...
&gt; Segwit improves the situation here by making signature data, which does not impact the UTXO set size, cost 75% less than data that does impact the UTXO set size. This is expected to encourage users to favour the use of transactions that minimise impact on the UTXO set in order to minimise fees, and to encourage developers to design smart contracts and new features in a way that will also minimise the impact on the UTXO set.

&gt; Reduced UTXO growth will benefit miners, businesses, and users who run full nodes, which in turn helps maintain the current security of the Bitcoin network as more users enter the system. Users and developers who help minimise the growth of the UTXO set will benefit from lower fees compared to those who ignore the impact of their transactions on UTXO growth.

https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/#reducing-utxo-growth

Some background on UTXO:
&gt; The Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) database is maintained by each validating Bitcoin node in order to determine whether new transactions are valid or fraudulent. For efficient operation of the network, this database needs to be very quick to query and modify, and should ideally be able to fit in main memory (RAM), so keeping the database’s size in bytes as small as possible is valuable.

&gt; This becomes more difficult as Bitcoin grows, as each new user must have at least one UTXO entry of their own and will prefer having multiple entries to help improve their privacy and flexibility, or to provide as backing for payment channels or other smart contracts.

False:
&gt; Segregated witness transactions will require lower fees, will afford much greater performance optimizations, and can support multistage smart contracts and protocols such as bi-directional payment channels that can scale without writing extra data to the blockchain. **Wallets are strongly encouraged to upgrade but can continue to operate without modification as the deployment does not break backwards compatibility.**

&gt;1. Create an opt-in registration system that allows participating users to register their wallet addresses (pubkeys) with their real-world identity, forming a “permission group”. Registered users can prove a given pubkey belongs to a given group pseudo-anonymously using a group signature. However there exists a backdoor that allows the system administrators to collude to deanonymize users.

&gt;2. Once a reasonable number of users have signed on, bribe miners to only mine blocks containing non-anonymous transactions from registered users, thus increasing cost and confirmation times for non-registered users. As part of the bribe, miners would also be required to register their identities.

&gt;3. Finally eliminate the remaining non-registered miners, making it impossible to use or mine Bitcoin without first registering your identity.


Stage 4. Watch the exchange rate of bitcoins plummet and users/developers/miners migrate to a cryptocurrency that isn't compromised. 

Also, what are you going to bribe miners with, fiat currency? The value of dollars has plummeted compared to bitcoins over the past 7 years given bitcoin's superior monetary properties.

https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3s72d1/bitcoin_ng_or_how_cornell_researchers_think_a/

I was very impressed with it at the time, and it got me brainstorming about some possible related scaling approaches, based on other generalizations of the notion of ""electing a czar for an epoch"" as discussed by the Cornell researchers:

&gt; [brainstorming bitcoin scaling] Multiple Czars per Epoch: Is there some way we could better exploit miners' massive petahashes of processing power to find some approaches to massive scaling solutions?

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3vgmb2/brainstorming_bitcoin_scaling_multiple_czars_per/

---

I personally don't know enough about Bitcoin tech to be able to evaluate the possible advantages and/or disadvantages of NG.

Unfortunately, it is unclear:

- whether Core ever evaluated the possible advantages and/or disadvantages of NG 

- whether they were able / willing to evaluate stuff like NG fairly and impartially

Since, as we know, Core / Blockstream seems to be biased towards their own solutions and against solutions proposed by others (eg, we have proof they have ignored other cool scaling approaches like Xtreme Thin Blocks, preferring Matt Corallo's centralized Relay Network instead)... it's hard to be sure whether novel approaches to scaling such as NG ever really get a fair hearing.

In particular, Blockstream CTO / Core roadmap author Gregory *""Le Bitcoin, c'est moi""* Maxwell may suffer from a ""Not Invented Here"" complex:

&gt; ""I am arguably one of the largest sources of new ideas for scaling in the Bitcoin space."" - /u/nullc

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/43mkgg/i_am_arguably_one_of_the_largest_sources_of_new/

---

In all fairness, there *was* a serious technical objection about NG raised at the time: evidently if the network were to select a ""czar"" (designated miner) for the 10-minute ""epoch"" *before* that miner also has a pool of transactions to append to the chain, then possibly that czar (designated miner) could be DDoS'ed.

I'm not sure if this technical objection was ever addressed.

Those Cornell researchers are probably worth keeping up-to-date on - they have submitted several interesting papers on possible threats and possible improvements for Bitcoin.

d2bvx9k,think-different,58,"The blockchain (the protocol behind Bitcoin) is pretty safe and there is no way to ""hack"" it theoretically unless you have control over 50% of the network, at which point it would be more profitable to work with the network rather than against it. The blockchain relies on the idea that rather than having one source acknowledging that a transaction has taken place, we utilize a ""hive mind"" (so to speak) to determine it, thus the minimum of 6 ""blocks"" required to deem the transaction as legitimate. Therefore you can't really hack the network since it is decentralized, kind of like how Wikipedia works - the more editors are following a certain page, the harder it is to place inaccurate or false information. 

I don't have time to explain how the entire blockchain works (many other sources online can explain it better than me) but whoever invented it is a genius. The blockchain protocol has further applications other than Bitcoin which is what makes it so interesting. I believe Bitcoin is only the beginning, acting as a proof of concept that a decentralized network can work with other applications, such as proof of existence, elections, etc. 

The scandal behind Mt Gox doesn't directly discredit the safety of Bitcoin, and by extension the blockchain protocol, but rather acts as a wake up call that exchanges need to better handle their security, although it is up for debate on whether there was indeed a hack or the owner just made a story to scam thousands of users.

I guess I am a seer, at least according to one reader.  I project the future that has already happened.    So…read on if you want to see what happened yesterday!

We broke into the $450 box yesterday so we climbed another box.  That move upward put this column into a long pole warning situation.  Until we get a reversal, this formation will be teetering on the edge.

A long pole warning happens when the price moves up four boxes above the previous top.  Generally speaking, when the price makes a short term reversal ( under $440) expect it to fall about halfway down the pole.  On this chart, that decline would go at least to $425.  Of course, it has to reverse to get there.  

If we do not reverse, the formation count of 11 columns still calls for a high of around $485.  That price target is a three to four week target based on the break out on 4/15.

The best news is that the price exceeded the most recent high in the $445 box.  I have no opinion on whether this represents a break out from the numerous triangles posted lately.

So, how would I look to trade this?  I would look for a reversal down into the high $430s, and then bail out until the reversal completes in the $420s.  Otherwise I am letting the coins run with the move upward.

In conclusion, I want to address the comments posted the other day.  I do not expect anyone to follow my advice or my charts.  I’ve said numerous times that these posts are simply my way of sitting down on a daily basis and assessing where I am.  I use these charts for my other trades.  The only difference is that I write the one for bitcoin more formally than the others.

I am happy to answer questions, and I don’t expect my opinion to go unchallenged.  Just as the weather changes every day, the charts and the interpretation can change every day.  So, when I contradict myself in the same post, that is fair fodder for criticism.  But, when the price moves from one condition to another, the analysis is going to change.

So, instead of commenting about me in a troll post, direct questions or criticisms to me.  Most people who read this on a daily basis know that my skin is thick and my mind is open.

Every time it's mentioned, a bunch of bitcoin users come out of the woodwork to offer help and guides on using this new money and to helpfully explain how all of its flaws are just scaremongering (or even worse, how its flaws are actually benefits).

What they don't tell you is that they're usually heavily invested in the project and by convincing others to buy bitcoins, the value of their investment rises. The most honest discussion of the currency is actually found on /r/buttcoin where users are actually allowed to scrutinise and satirise the protocols and people behind it. Some of the most interesting proof-of-concepts have come from there.

For some people, evangelising digital currency is a full time job. On Reddit, it can be difficult to tell the difference between an opinionated anarcho-capitalist and someone who is $30K deep into a cloud mining venture.

I mined bitcoins back when CPU mining was profitable so I try to explain things as neutrally as possible.

d2e24sy,vbuterin,76,"This argument that ""computation"" is something that is _oh so much harder_ than ""verification"", and that one is acceptably fast for a blockchain and the other is not, is absolutely false. Let's look at a function of some contract, say for example [a CFD for hedging](https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/blob/develop/ethereum/tests/test_contracts.py#L297):

    else:
        othervalue = self.fiatValue
        ethvalue = othervalue / self.datafeed.get(self.index)
        if ethvalue &gt;= self.balance:
            send(self.partyone, self.balance)
            return(3)
        elif block.timestamp &gt; self.maturity:
            send(self.partytwo, self.balance - ethvalue)
            send(self.partyone, ethvalue)
            return(4)
        else:
            return(5)

There's the main body of the code. All it does is fetch variables, do a division to get the amount of ETH to send, send ETH to two addresses and return. Now, compare that to the complexity of [verifying an ECDSA signature](https://github.com/vbuterin/pybitcointools/blob/master/bitcoin/main.py#L554). So for reasonably simple contracts, the ECDSA is a much bigger deal than the division and sends that the on-chain derivative processes. There are slowdowns in ethereum, but most of them are actually due to leveldb storage, which is in turn magnified by the use of the Merkle tree - and the Merkle tree is really damn important, as it allows Ethereum clients to implement [magic like this](https://twitter.com/btsfav/status/722808235397423104) in months when Bitcoin took many years to get to headers-first.

Doing heavy computation on the blockchain is indeed insane; that's what services like [the ethereum computation market are for](http://www.ethereum-computation-market.com/). Note particularly, the ethereum computation market's incentive model actually **requires** statefulness in order to work.

&gt; Greg goes through a bunch of use cases toward the end and shows how they are or will be handled better using the Bitcoin model. 

He doesn't go through ""use cases"", he goes through five permutations of ""this program is kinda big"". This can be addressed through the ethereum computation market.

&gt; given that on-chain computation is really expensive

False, as described above. Sigh.

Second, I'll express my disappointment that some Bitcoin people **continue** to emphasize ""Turing-completeness"" when I have [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/2bbpng/ethereum_the_good_the_bad_the_ugly/cj4ey5l) [multiple](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/2dfztp/can_someone_tell_me_what_ethereum_is_and_how_is/cjpx4og) [times](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4f367i/why_use_telephone_when_we_have_a_perfectly_good/d263nzg) that it's statefulness that is the point. Once you have Ethereum's philosophical model (and imo, our approach of viewing scripts as ""doing stuff"" rather than being ""predicates"" is massively superior and vastly easier to understand for developers), then Turing-completeness actually becomes harder **not to have** than to have - it's actually tricky to figure out what restrictions to put on recursive contract calling to eliminate the potential for loops, and some measure of gas is required in any case for the same reason why a block size limit is required in bitcoin.

There are [actually good critiques](http://www.multichain.com/blog/2015/11/smart-contracts-slow-blockchains/) regarding parallelizability, and which we are addressing through parallelizability and asynchrony in Serenity and later sharding, but ""OMG verification is hard"" isn't one of them.

&gt; total languages. I also consider that a major useful point for languages for this kind of system

Ah yes. The analogy I use here is blood types. If you are a person giving blood, you want to have type O blood so that anyone can accept your blood. If you are a person receiving blood, you want to have type AB blood so that you can accept anyone's blood. Similarly, with programming languages, Turing-completeness is type AB: no matter what other paradigm you have, you can compile it to Turing-complete, but you can't compile Turing-complete to total functional no matter how hard you try. Hence, you want the base layer to be type AB (ie. Turing-complete) so that you can accept anything regardless of developers' individual needs, and if some use cases require specific forms of verifiability, compositionality, etc, then they can build total functional / functional / declarative / stateless / whatever HLLs on top and have them compile down to the Turing-complete base. So I fully support people building total-functional HLLs on top of ethereum.",2016-04-23 15:54:21

Absolutely. This is a sub where *the most important topics in Bitcoin* can be discussed.

Turns out, the most important topics in Bitcoin are mostly political: the mismanagement of Core, the attempt to stifle innovation and choice, and the division and anger in the community that this situation is allowed to persist. Past that, the next most important set of issues are the technical ones like the potential problems caused by soft forks, the possibility of centralization of LN, the block size limit, and so forth.

Since these topics aren't discussable on /r/bitcoin they all end up here, where they can be discussed without having ones posts removed surreptitiously. Not surprisingly, they serve as platforms to the furious users who want to vent their frustrations and have few places to be heard.

d2eqah4,jstolfi,67,"&gt; Fees haven't gone up as much as I expected, nor have backlogs become as bad as I expected. My issue is that there's no way for us to tell if this is because people have stopped using Bitcoin as a result of some of the periods of high contention for block space.

As a service gets near saturation,  it is expected that demand will stop growing when it is still somewhat below the maximum capacity.  If there are alternatives, users will switch to them; not because the price of the service will go up (which will hardly happen), but because of the occasional unpredictable delays caused by surges in demand.   That is not specific to payment systems: it would happen to restaurants, roads, internet forums, etc.  If you have to wait for an hour to be seated at your usual restaurant, next time you will probably choose some other place. 

Usually, businesses that see the demand getting close to their capacity will take steps to increase the capacity -- expanding their physical facilities,  opening more stores, contracting more internet bandwidth. 

Letting the demand run into the capacity is always a stupid idea.  For every service, there is an optimum point on the price x demand curve where the net revenue of the supplier is maximized; but the right way to get that point is to fix the price, not the capacity.

If that optimum point has a demand below the current capacity, then the capacity limit is irrelevant; the supplier just sets the price to that optimum value, and the demand adjust itself.  If, on the other hand, the optimum point has demand above the capacity limit, then the limit will mean **less** net revenue for the miner -- even if it causes the price to be higher than the optimum value.  

In fact, if the service runs into its capacity limit, the price probably *won't* get as high as predicted by the price x demand curve.  Suppose that a restaurant can seat 200 people, but finds out that the optimum operating point is at 20% higher prices, when the expected demand would be 100 customers during lunch hour.  If the owner reduces the seating to 100 tables, he will find that only 90 will be filled on average, because the long wait lines on some days will drive users away until the demand drops down to that level.  Then, any increase in the price would only reduce the attendance even further -- pushing the operating point further away from the optimum.

Well done, nobody can bother to discuss the merits and problems with SegWit (much less LN) because *crap like this takes over*.

If you don't like it, don't feed the trolls. Tweets like this fuel the fire on both sides. Instead of bitching about behavior, why don't you address the concerns that drive the behavior? Wanna talk about governance crises or technical limitations or the purpose of Bitcoin? Great!

Whiny bitching about people being whiny bitches? Constructive. Let's all upvote this shit and make the problem worse, guys.

----

Since I have a habit of attempting to practice what I preach, here are some ~~concerns~~ bitches that I have encountered, of varying importance, that address SegWit and Lightning directly on its merit:

#SegWit is not LN.
SegWit is a necessary infrastructure improvement to enable LN, but it is not, and does not solve any of the problems of, Lightning. SegWit by itself, without the fee discount or soft fork, is almost 100% positive for Bitcoin and its users. Criticism of SegWit is commonly (and fairly) directed at its deployment method or data accounting discrepancy. Criticism of LN comes from all directions and is not to be confused with criticism of SegWit or specific facets of its implementation directly.   
SegWit manages to stand on its own as a viable upgrade to Bitcoin, riders and caveats notwithstanding, that does solve the issue of transaction malleability while further enabling efficiency improvements across the network.  
Shovel that FUD.

#SegWit doesn't help your coins today.
Sure, SegWit addresses aren't malleable and get a priority fee discount on the blockchain - but your coins aren't in a SegWit address, now are they? The only benefit users can get from SegWit necessitates another non-SegWit signed transaction for all uses.

#SegWit's current implementation effectively neuters its benefits - for everyone else, that is.
The fee discount is, in effect, a data subsidy: SegWit addresses get a discounted fee rate that ""standard"" coins do not. They can store up to four times the data against the same fees. This means that ""standard"" transactions are effectively subsidizing the existence of SegWit extension space that they cannot use - when a standard transaction pays fees, those fees cover the consumption of *potential* extension space that will go unused due to the presence of the standard transaction consuming standard blockspace that cannot be used to store SegWit hashes.  
Another way of looking at it is this: a non-SegWit transaction is paying for the unused extension space it denies to other transactions by existing. This is, in practice, a fee subsidy: SegWit transactions get to broadcast more data for the same price.  
The malleability fix is a one-way street, too; only transactions from SegWit addresses can be trusted as unmalleable and even transactions *to* SegWit addresses are malleable until confirmed. The existence of SegWit transactions makes standard transactions higher-profile targets for nefarious activity - so sure, it's ""optional"", but you can't afford not to. Where I come from, that's called extortion! So it goes with RBF - but that's off topic for this post and strays dangerously into conspiracy territory, so I will move on.

#Actual implementations of LN steal fees from miners.
Every description of an implementation of a Lightning-style transaction system has included the potential for a ""middle man fee"": the extra fees a channel operator charges for the convenience of facilitating a transaction across its unsettled channels. Those are fees collected by the middle man, not the miners, but the issue is double compounded by the fact that Lightning transactions are basically complicated unconfirmed smart contracts - which means the Bitcoin network will be relaying all that interim data and actual commerce without miners collecting a satoshi of fees against any of it, while channel operators get everything users are paying.

#No solution to the monopoly-reduction problem facing LN has been proposed.
This is the big kahuna - the elephant in the room. Payment channels will, by nature, become centralized, and the system as it is implemented today favors large coin-holders. In a free market this devolves into a power monopoly where one or a small few actors hold all the economic advantages and can (will!) leverage that power to stifle competition. Nobody has a clue what to do to mitigate or prevent the inevitable centralization of *power* within the Bitcoin ecosystem should cofunded bidirectional smart contract payment channels (i.e. Lightning) become the most common use case on the network.

#SegWit was sold as a capacity increase, but it's not.
Sure, it allows more *data* - but not any data, no - only the data specified by SegWit. Everyone else is forced to fight over the original 1MB, and with a new competitor on the scene that has a baked-in economic advantage, natch.

#SegWit was not sold as a malleability fix, which it is.
The one major shining selling point of SegWit was the fact that SegWit transactions are unmalleable, and therefore *much* more trustworthy with zero confirms. This should be the focal point of SegWit, and it's never been.

#Lightning *still* doesn't exist at all.
Sure, we have early prototypes and beta tests, but the fact is that today's Bitcoin users have exactly two types of transactions to choose from: P2PKH (""1 address"") or P2SH(""3 address""). SegWit is not on that list. Today, Bitcoin does not have SegWit, or Lightning, or side chains. It has Bitcoin transactions, and that is what Bitcoin users transfer value with today. Today, there is no benefit at all to any Bitcoin user from Lightning or SegWit or sidechains, which leads me to my closing point:

#SegWit is not solving the problems we have now.
There's an actual fundamental limit right now to the amount of data that can be mined to the blockchain. Once SegWit is completed, that fundamental limit will be somewhat increased (only for SegWit transaction data, though) but the limit will still exist. That limit is magnitudes smaller than the real-world use case demands. Other, simpler solutions were unilaterally rejected *over 18 months ago* - and now that Bitcoin is facing critical mass, we get this instead? *Now that's a fucking valid concern!*
#Bitching about bitching addresses none of these bitches!

So don't bitch about bitching, you're just being as much of a bitch as the bitches you're bitching about. If you don't like the bitching, then *fucking answer the questions instead of bitching back*!

d2ebmvl,spookthesunset,29,"&gt; Satoshi premined 1 million btc.

As we speak, that 1 million BTC is going into the construction of the ultimate free market utopia.  I speak of Satoshi's Interstellar Comet, of course.

You see, Satoshi foresaw the downfall of the lizard peoples dirty fiat and for years he pondered a solution.  The solution was Bitcoin, a wondrous fundamental-based trustless math system that would end wars, cure poverty, and save crackheads from Hepatitis C.  The problem was, earth is already taken over by militarized goons hellbent on power.

So Satoshi sought a new world.  One that is free of government interference and regulation.  Years went by as Satoshi scanned the heavens looking for salvation.  And then one crisp winter day, he found it.  A lonesome comet far away from the galactic flock.  Armed with 1 million bitcoin, he got into his spaceship and began the multi-day voyage through hyperspace.

For more than 8 years, Satoshi has been building this comet, block by block so that bitcoin holders such as yourself can buy and sell *anything* you want.  If you want heroin-laced toe cream, you can buy it at virtually every corner bodega.  If you want to harvest your grandma's organs before she kicks the bucket, all you have to do is convince her to sign a smart contract and it shall be done.  If you want to take the money you just made selling her kidney and buy some delicious 25i-NBOMe, all you have to do is walk down to the corner deli and ask.

In short, this paradise is all provided because of the pre-mined 1 million BTC.  I dare you to find an alt-coin that has such a wonderous free market waiting for their holders.

Om een transactie te kunnen verwerken moeten alle andere transacties vergeleken worden: waarna bekeken wordt of jij eigenlijk wel genoeg op je rekening had op het moment dat het daadwerkelijk overgemaakt wordt. 

Dit is complex, zwaar en duur. Waarbij allerlei acties ook nog eens menselijke controle kunnen triggeren. Maak jij nou al voor de vijfde keer vandaag het maximum van €500 over naar een rekening in Cambodja: daar moet Reinoud van Risk even nader naar kijken.

d2fcxpe,jstolfi,19,"Mining concentration has the same causes as concentration in other industries, from shaving razors to airplanes.

Industries that remain decentralized are those that cater to a varied public with diverse preferences, like specialty beers; or are tied to specific locations, like wine and tourism; or have significant transportation costs, like staple foods.  Even these often get partly centralized by franchises or holding companies.  Obviously none of these factors apply to bitcoin: anyone in the world can mine any transaction from anywhere, and there is no transportation cost.

There is no sign that mining centralization is diminishing.  If anything, small miners seem to be disappearing.  Even 21.inc, that had 5% of the hashpower six months ago, has not mined anything for the last month or more.

Keep in mind that during its bubble runs, this does not hold true as each reversal is met with an almost immediate run up.  So,  if you are shorting give it some time to avoid getting caught in the immediate bounce.

I entered the two areas that show the most resistance from our current price to the highs of the Fall 2015 bubble.  The first area of resistance was broken at $450.  The next set, at the December/January highs is around $465-70.  The final area to break through is between $490-95.  After break through those areas there is little to keep the price down from recent moves.

Of course there are millions of coins that were bought above $500 and many of those folks will be thrilled to see “green” on their screen that it will form new resistance going forward.

So, I am waiting for a small pullback of between $415-$25, and then I expect us to keep moving up.  The movement of $45-10 a day lately is encouraging.  I would rather see that than $100 a day.  Rises at that rate are unsustainable.

The other charts to look at are the SPX, which looks like it is poised for a reversal downward.   It has risen almost 300 points since February, from the low of 1820 up to 2110.  That is bitcoin-type movement.  It cannot possibly be sustainable—at least not with earnings as they have been.

The SLV chart Is poised for a huge breakout.  If the SLV tracking price goes over 17 it will be a triple top, and that is a very bullish signal.

The VXX is approaching the low of last August.  Any that time it turned around and rose 12 points in the next month.  Again, levels this low do not hang around for long.

It should be an interesting week.

However, as a protocol, it is a very innovative breakthrough that solves what was previously an ""unsolvable"" problem. They are in essence a means of tagging ownership in a way that cannot be revoked by any party except the recipient. This includes huge entities; the entire power of the US government with judicial orders, military and control of networks can't reverse a transaction (although they could destroy the entire bitcoin economy if they were that motivated). This is similar to gold, in that if I hand you a gold brick and you walk away, I can't then untrade that gold. Except with bitcoin you don't need to be physically present, we can transact over a network.

This is obviously applicable as a currency, but thats just one application. Private stock ledgers, real estate deeds, wills, exchanges, transaction networks, identity, pretty much anything that requires a record of ownership that is transferable can be done more securely and efficiently using a cryptocurrency.

Aaron, you have a really thick skin to state this.

If anything the events of the past 1 year proved that Bitcoin is centrally planned currently by a small circle, enabled by the centralization of development under a single profit oriented company and the consolidation of mining.

Meanwhile there is 0 evidence that a HF to lift the blocksize limit would cause centralization, quite the contrary. keeping the network crippled leads to sustained centralization and highly likely a complete failure of the experiment.

What you presented here is nothing but laughable mental gymnastics and propaganda.

Anyways, I'm not angry about you or the idiots of BlockstreamCore. I'm angry because majority of the ecosystem can be manipulated by lies and propaganda.

&gt; The real reason why Core / Blockstream always favors soft-forks over hard-forks (even though hard-forks are actually safer because hard-forks are *explicit*) is because soft-forks allow the ""incumbent"" code to quietly remain incumbent forever (and in this case, the ""incumbent"" code is Core)

Krugman and other economists like to get caught up in the economic ""policy"" (inflationary, deflationary), because they lack the imagination to see use cases beyond legacy ""dumb money"".  It is, of course, illogical to comment on economic policy before you fundamentally understand the technology that you're talking about.

Yes. Then we can use Bitcoin as base to compare with Ethereum because there is a good chance it may overtake Bitcoin for the simple fact that Ethereum is capable of more functionalities. Another reason we can use bitcoin as a base is because it has more trading volume than ether in USD so we can assume that the market has valued bitcoin more correctly than Ether.

* How strong is transaction activity in Ethereum compared to Bitcoin?

(35,430 Ethereum Transactions per Day/ 220,708 Bitcoin Transactions per Day) x 100 = 16%. Activity in Ethereum is 16% of Bitcoin. 

* Calculate the fair value of ETH based on the 16% transaction activity by multiplying it to the bitcoin market cap.

(0.16 x $7,177,719,581 Bitcoin market cap) / 79,431,010 ETH Supply = **$14.458**.

* Is ETH undervalued or overvalued?

At the current price of $7.37, ETH is undervalued by 51%. **The price should be at least two times to reach fair value**.",2016-04-26 11:52:56

d2hqnfu,dpinna,18,"One major reason not being discussed is that normal money transfers aren't possible unless you have a bank account. Bitcoin allows someone in,  say, Kenya to receive an international transfer of money without using bank accounts. We take for granted the infrastructure costs of having a bank account. In the West we typically don't pay for our account because our bank deposits are so large (relatively) that the bank is incentivized to finance them itself. Compare this to an African country where the monthly wage is $10. The result is that billions of people on this planet do not have access to online financial services... Bitcoin breaks that barrier. 

The importance of Bitcoin is heavily skewed in favor of countries with devalued currencies, inconvenient banking fees and capital controls.

d2j19q6,yolotrades,41,"Just some bullish fud from me. Was just thinking about this and it astonished me. I was reading the other day about that Vladimir club, which is basically anyone with 2100 BTC (i.e., they're ""one in ten thousand"". Which, is actually just about the level for being a current ""bitcoin millionaire"" in USD terms). For comparison, there are 10.1 *million* households in the US with net wealth &gt; $1 million. Take 10,000 of them (which is 0.0990% of all of those households. Remember, this is just the USA, too.) and fill a medium-sized concert hall (or even a few smaller ones). Now, imagine that those 10,000 people controlled all the wealth of one particular asset. If *anyone* else outside that concert hall wanted on board, they'd need to buy it from one of those people, or someone who had bought it from one of those people. If even a fraction of a fraction of the high net wealth individuals in the world desire bitcoin, the price is going to go bonkers. Oh, and I forgot to mention. The supply is permanently and indefinitely fixed. No matter how much you'd like to plant more ""tulips"" or mine more ""gold"", it won't come out of the ground any faster. If you want to acquire more than some percent of X amount every 10 minutes, you'll need to buy it, and you'll need to buy it from someone in that room.

We are the people in that room. We are the owners of that asset. I mean, I've bought ~550 BTC over the last few years in total. With 15.5M bitcoin in circulation, that makes me a ""one in 28,000"". So, maybe not a few small concert halls. Maybe fill a smaller college sports arena instead, and repeat the above analogy. It *still* astonishes me that I've got that much of the pie. Even for the lower numbers it astonishes me. My friend who I convinced to buy 2.25 BTC? He paid $1k for them. If bitcoin was worth even 1/10th of golds market cap, his 2.25 BTC would be worth $107,174 ($47,633 / BTC). It's just ridiculous. I'll admit to being a moon kid. I think I have solid reasoning for why I think bitcoin is going to skyrocket in value (over time mind you. It may not even happen this time, though I think it's leaning that way.). And who would I be if I didn't put my fucking money where my beliefs are. I think Louie CK said it best when he talked about his [""little believies""] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99dDA0bx3kM). Lots of people have heard of bitcoin, and maybe they even think it's cool and ""believe"" in it. But we're the ones in the trenches, we're the ones walking the walk, and in a case where bitcoin becomes widely desirable, we're the ones that will become an entirely new wealthy subset of the population. There *are not many* of us. Relish it, for we are living it right now. Regardless of what the price does in the next few hours or days or years, we're part of something special and deep down I think we all know it.

We did not move up, or down yesterday.  

The chart remains in a column of Xs and in a Long Pole Warning situation.  This means that the recent rise has been consistent, without a pull back.  If you are trading, it is likely to be choppy, and we are seeing that this morning.

At this point, we will revert into a column of Os with a price dip under $455.  As of this writing we are dropping pretty quickly down into that area.  If we break $455 the drop could go down as much as half the column.  That would take us back to the $435 area.

We are bumping up against resistance at the $465-70 area.  This is the triple top from the end of last year, where we tried three times ti break $470 and it failed.  It is going to take quite a push to make it through this time.

So what do I think will happen?  We are going to struggle here for a couple of days.  Getting through $470 is going to be tough.  Remember, I am using a weighted average of bitcoin exchanges.  I know we DID break $470 on some exchanges, but on average the dollar price across all exchanges failed to break through.

Without some kind of “event” I do not see us reversing down to low $400s where we would be talking about trend reversals and break downs.

So, yesterday the long pole fell over.  That is why they call it a “warning.”

The pole, based on BitcoinAverage.com fell over, and the price went down to a low of $438.01.  

The column with the pole was 12 boxes high.  Traditionally, when the pole falls the price drops about half the length of the pole.  The drop from the high in the $465 box was exactly 6 boxes.  This time the chart gave the warning and the range perfectly.

When the chart warns you, it is best to listen.  I guess.  I figured it was over a little before it was.

Today the price seems to be moving up nicely towards another reversal at $450.  This is a typical bullish looking chart for Bitcoin.  

The new positive break out is at $470 now.  That would make the higher high, and the higher low of this formation.

So, where do we go from here?  I would look for a break through to a new column at $450 sometime today or tomorrow.  We are fairly close right bow.  We can do that and move sideways for a few days.

I am a little skeptical of a run at $500 until next week some time.

The problem with that is if the price moves in the opposite way you bet, you can very easily have your entire account liquidated and lose all your money.  Once the price hits your liquidation price they close your trade so you can still pay back the lender.  So these Chinese exchanges just run a script and know exactly how much the price would have to move up or down to liquidate the majority of traders on their exchange.

That's why a lot of these bitcoin trading platforms offer ridiculous leverage like 20x 50x, even 100x.  At that point all it takes is the price to move a few dollars and you can lose the entire balance of your account.  ",2016-04-28 09:17:34

d2jj48t,RenaKunisaki,13,"The problem isn't *that* they're making money by showing ads, but *how* they're doing it. Presenting it as just a ""free service"" while running massive ad networks across the web (and elsewhere) that spy on you and collect huge amounts of personal information, piecing together a staggeringly detailed profile based on every little bit of data they can scrape. These ad networks have tracking scripts/beacons on millions of sites that analyze everything they possibly can. It's creepy and extremely invasive, and they're doing this all without any real consent or way to opt out.

""But you consent to it by using Facebook!"" And do I consent to them still doing that when I *don't* use it, by their scripts on other sites? Am I expected to not consent by simply not using the web at all? Not very realistic.

""But you *can* opt out!"" Sure, many ad networks do offer this option, but:

* there are so many of them, it'd take forever (and new ones spring up all the time)
* good luck even finding all of their ""opt out"" pages
* I shouldn't have been ""opted in"" without my consent in the first place
* opting out doesn't erase what they already have
* there's no way to be sure if the option actually does anything (if it's even presented) - some of these companies are quite sleazy

And there are many more reasons to block these networks as much as you can:

* the amount of bandwidth (and CPU time and memory) they consume is obscene. Some of those animated banners are several megabytes; some of the scripts are thousands of lines of code, slowing down everything you do.
 * this is especially significant on mobile - removing the Facebook app (which requires hacking to remove!) from an LG G4 can boost battery life by ~20%!
* those massive scripts also have a tendency to make the actual content unusable (looking at you, Youtube and Twitch, with ads that like to break the player so the actual video can't be seen)
* ad networks frequently serve malware, by getting hacked or not screening their ads closely enough
* many of them will approve just about anything, including outright scams
* they're *incredibly annoying* - who likes popups? or blaring loud commercials? (bad enough when it's on TV or a video ad that doesn't respect volume, but when you aren't expecting sound at all, nope, fuck that.)

For me though, more than anything, it comes down to trust. I don't trust these companies. Why would I? I don't know who's behind them. All I know is they're not acting in my best interest; in fact, quite the opposite, since their goal is to invade my privacy and try to manipulate me (psychology in advertising is a *huge* field of study) and annoy me into buying things I don't need. I consider that quite *against* my best interests; they want me to feel afraid or inadequate, such that I really need this product, and want to take as much of my money and personal information as they can.

On top of that, ads are a parasite. They infect a host, leech off it as much as they can, then leave it for dead. Look at how ads have infested and to varying degrees ruined TV, the web, peer-to-peer communication (spam emails, phone calls, texts...), public space (billboards everywhere), games, movies, computers, and phones. Why would I want to support that? Ads don't *support* the services I use, they *consume* them. Once your service becomes dependent on ad revenue, you're at the advertisers' mercy - run what we like, silence what we don't, or we pull the ads and you go broke.

Look at the amount of software (especially on mobile) that gets bought out and turned into adware (anywhere from spying on you, to showing ads in its UI, to outright infecting the system and popping up ads randomly) or malware (using your PC as a bitcoin mining slave), or that's created as adware from the start and made to look just like an existing app in order to confuse people. This is especially done with file sharing apps and ad blockers now. The media companies tried to squash them legally, it didn't work out, now they're attacking by making them untrustworthy (so that even the legit ones suffer because it's hard to tell them apart from the clones).

Look at the games that have gone from a simple, enjoyable game to a scam. Practically every game now has some type of DLC or pay-to-win mechanic. (DLC doesn't *have* to be a bad thing; if it's actually an ""expansion pack"" created after the game's release, sure. But when it's released the same day as the game, or just unlocks content already in the game, or is stupidly simple stuff like a skin for a character, that's just abuse.)

Look at TV and tell me how the hell you can stand it. You pay ever more for access to the content and yet, it's cut down and sped up to make room for more ads. Ads show up *over* and *in* the content. The content *itself* becomes ads. Or look at DVDs/Blu-rays with long unskippable ads every time you watch them, or movie theatres running as much as 30 minutes of ads before the movie. Here I'm *paying for* the service and still getting ads!

On top of all that, here in Canada and in many other countries, the major internet service providers are also major media companies, which creates a major conflict of interest. Service is deliberately slow and awful, and tight caps are put on anyone who isn't subscribed to TV and phone service, just to ensure streaming and VoIP won't threaten their business model. ISPs spy on you and inject additional ads into pages you visit. You basically can't get a trustworthy connection.

""But how will my site survive without ad revenue?"" Two part answer. First, let me ask *you* a question: why am *I* paying for *your* website? If I want to open a shop, or make a movie, or buy a car, or stream video games online, I'm expected to cover all the costs myself, even if I provide a service to others (eg a shop, a nice movie, a taxi service, some entertainment). If I don't make a profit doing so, that's my own poor business management. But if I want a website to put my stuff on, suddenly I can ask everyone else to pay for it with ads, and blame them when it doesn't make money?

Second, do you know how much it costs to host a site on the various P2P services like Freenet? $0/year. How much does it cost to distribute the content you've created via bittorrent? $0. The reason your site needs ad revenue to survive is because that's how the system is designed. Instead of promoting someone else's business, maybe promote a less broken system?

I could go on about this all day, but **tl;dr**: Facebook doesn't deserve to make money off harvesting my personal information and ruining things I like in order to provide a service I don't even want.",2016-04-28 02:04:21

As an aside, and a cultural peek outside of our daily manic depressive swinging bubble:

Probably no one here knows, but I am a teacher. Many of my teenage students saw a bitcoin shirt I was wearing recently and knew what it was. gasp! Well sort of. They were astonished that their teacher knows about the ""bitcoin billionaire"" game (which I had never heard of but is apparently popular?). I mentioned it was more than just that game. One student asked, ""isn't it, like, real digital money?"" I don't really discuss off topic things with my students so my answer was a simple ""yeah, basically"" and we moved on. The interaction with them and their enthusiasm about seeing my shirt serves as a reminder to me that most people STILL don't know about bitcoin, or what it is if the name rings a bell, but that widespread awareness might be just lurking around the generational corner.

Millennials grew up with the dawn of the internet, I'm not sure if I'm one of them or a gen X, or something between? But there's the seedlings of this new generation of kids that never knew a world without cell phones, or touchscreens, or google. They are smart, savvy, and culturally diverse. I think Steam adding bitcoin support is a big deal. I'm not much of a gamer myself anymore, but a lot of these kids are. And they are un-banked.

Now the morality and parenting of it aside, if teens had access to bitcoin they'd be empowered by using it in their internet life, buying games, renting movies, making small cash for art, or youtube videos, tutoring each other, funding campaigns for school events...or you know these genius kids that invent devices to clean drinking water, or whatever. There likely will be abuses of it too, hence the morality issue. Regardless, I imagined tonight about a new sort of teen-economy emerging in the coming years and there's really nothing other than bitcoin that could be the catalyst.

I had a very lengthy discussion with /u/guywithtwohats in Monday's thread about how this bitfinex longs data was a prime indicator that we were ready for a dump. When we reach highs on that chart, it's a sign that the bullish leverage traders are all in.

Yesterday I got completely out of my long at $458 and put some buys all the way down to $430 in $2.50 increments on futures. Now my cost basis is $440. This post was downvoted heavily for being bearish. Bulls seem to think that if they downvote all the bearish posts as they show up, that somehow it will hold the price up. I want bitcoin to succeed as much as any of you (check my username), but I'm in this thing to make money. I think this sub should be pretty ashamed of the quality of conversation we had in here yesterday. People announcing anything slightly bearish, even just how they were going to react if the price dropped more, were downvoted to oblivion.

Today is a complete toss up IMO. The chart looks really good but I;m not certain we are out of the woods yet. We got a healthy bounce this time, and we got a few green hourly candles. The phrase ""bull trap"" comes to mind though. A few days at this price level or higher would be extremely bullish, but you can't call the dump over for certain on the day after it happens.

Everyone should have a plan for a big move down or a big move up from here. I got some smaller buys down to $430 again, because it wouldn't shock me to test those levels again, but unless it goes below $430, I think it would be a dip buying opportunity. If it goes below $430 (unlikely I'm thinking), then I'm again gtfo at a loss, and I know a lot of margin longers would as well. My plan for the price going up is to sit on my hands until $470 is broken again. This will be hard to do, but that's my plan.

Good luck guys. Let's hope today isn't so painful. I would love to hear how others will be trading our current situation.

2 You may still like bigger blocks but that should be because you think the transaction fee is too high not because a particular transaction doesn't confirm (which will always be true (a too low fee transaction won't confirm) for any block size (edit: even for an infinite block size because miners might not include the transaction or it won't relay).",2016-04-30 14:35:50
d2n4eqg,bobthesponge1,31,"OpenBazaar has several decentralised components and the value is in the integration.

Right now:

* decentralised DNS-like system (converting GUIDs to IPs via a [DHT] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table))
* decentralised ID system (converting handles to GUIDs via Bitcoin-based [BlockchainID](https://github.com/okTurtles/blockchainid))
* decentralised end-to-end encrypted chat (with standard crypto and the ID system)
* decentralised payments (using Bitcoin)
* decentralised market of moderators (based on 2-of-3 multisig and ID reputation)
* decentralised search (by storing tag-to-listing mappings in the DHT)
* decentralised reputation (based on ratings and followers)

In the future:

* distributed store hosting (with [IPFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System))
* decentralised anonymisation (with Tor)
* better decentralised search and reputation

Like I said, I find that unlikely, but even if it does, using and understanding it can wait until then.

&gt; you don't want to understand Bitcoin

It's not that I don't want to, it's just that there isn't a point to right now. I know enough about BitCoin to know that it doesn't do me anything useful at the moment. If that changes, then I'll take another look.

Steam accepts BitCoin now, much like it accepts PayPal, WebMoney, PagSeguro and Russian Kiosks. From Steam's point of view, it's a payment provider. That doesn't mean that Russian Kiosks are the future of global currency.

&amp;nbsp;

And I'm glad that you now have a payment provider that is cheaper to you than whatever alternatives you had before. I'm from one of those countries where stuff on Steam is cheaper on our currency than it would ever be in USD or bitcoins or anything else, so bitcoin is still irrelevant to me or anyone I know.

If that ever changes and it means that I'm going to have access to cheaper stuff and save money on transactions, then great! But, right now, there's no reason for me to bother with it.

&amp;nbsp;

And just to sum it up and hopefully clear the air, I'm not saying that bitcoin is useless or that knowing how bitcoin works is useless or that bitcoin won't ever be relevant worldwide. I'm just saying that, right now, it could stop existing and I wouldn't notice, and I don't expect that to change anytime soon.
